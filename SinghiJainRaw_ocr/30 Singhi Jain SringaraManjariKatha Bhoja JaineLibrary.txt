PREFACE.
Śrngāramañjarī Kathā of Bhojadeva, based on a single (and the
only known) manuscript is being brought to light here for the first
time. The present study has been divided into four sections. The
first section Introduction, describes the peculiarities of the manuscript
and analyses its contents. The second section consists of the text
itself. The manuscript contained many scribal errors. These have
been corrected and the original corrupt readings have been given in the
footnotes. The folio numbers of the manuscript have been given in
square brackets and the sides are indicated by the letters A and B.
The completed lines have been indicated by superscribed numerals in
round brackets. At the end of the text has been given an index of
proper names occurring in the text. The third section contains the
translation of the Sanskrit text. The small fragments have not been
translated. The twelth tale also in which the thread of narrative is lost
has been left untranslated. The numbers in brackets in the translation
correspond to the page number of the Sanskrit text. The fourth section
comprises of Notes, Appendices and Indices. The Notes deal with only
those words and expressions which are rare or remarkable in some way.
Appendix I is a transcript from the Madras Manuscript of the
Śrngāra-Prakāśa which was kindly sent to me by Dr. V. Raghavan.
It bears important relationship with some technical points in the present
text (Chapter Five). Appendix II is a grouping together of maxims
found in the text.
During this study, I was often required to consult the Srngāros-
Prakāśa of Bhoja, no part of which was available then in printed form.
I take this opportunity to express my deep sense of gratitude to Dr.
V. Raghavan of the Madras University, for helping me by sending
references, time and again, from the Sủngāraprakāśa manuscript. .
As to my indebtedness to Muni Sri Jinavijayaji, what shall I
say when I owe so much to him, from learning the a, b, c of deciphering
the palm-leaf MS. down to the guidance in even the smallest details of
preparation and presentation the text ? Suffice it to say that but for his
manifold help, guidance and encouragement, I could not have undertaken
and completed the present work. And as if this were not enough,
he has so kindly included my work for publication in the illustrious
Singhi Jain Series and taken all the trouble to see it through the press,
from start to finish. Such a huge debt cannot be repaid in any amount
of words. I can only register my deep sentiment of gratitude and
respect towards him.

INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER I
THE PLACE OF FIND AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MS.
The palmleaf Ms. of the Śụngāramañjarikathā (hereafter
mentioned as SMK) of King Bhojadeva was found in the Jesalmere
Jñána Bhandāra. It was first noticed by Dr. G. Bühler when he went
to examine the Bhaņdāras in 1874. He says:-
'A poetical composition by Bhoja--the Sụngāramañjarikathā ---
is partly preserved in a fragment which I found in 1874 in the
Bșhadjñānakośa at Jesalmere. A colophon on fol. 149b runs as
follows:- for ERTETETTETÀTT ÊTuhaafa fari TTITAT7789141
पमराककथानिका द्वादशी समाप्ता । The work is partly in prose and partly in
verse.'1
The same Ms. has been listed in the 'Catalogue of Mss. in the
Jesalmere Bhandāras' compiled by C. D. Dalal after his visit to Jesal-
mere in 1916. The Catalogue observes, at one place ‘No. 32
(1) TRATT by Bhoja, incomplete.' (2) in the introductory part
of the same catalogue, Pandit Lalchandra Gandhi writes: TREET
भोज (क ३२५ (२)) कथासंग्रहमयीयं सुरसा कथा संस्कृतभाषायां संस्कृतभाषाजीवातुना
सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरणादिप्रणेता महाराजभोजदेवेन विरचितेति तदन्तर्गतकपत्रे उल्लेखदर्शनाद-
DECI (3)
A few lines from fol. 69a and 69 b are then quoted from the Ms.
Evidently Bühler had only seen stray leaves of the Ms, for he in-
correctly avers that the work is partly in prose and partly in verse.
Pandit Gandhi, however, has rightly observed that SMK is a Kathā,
emboxed within which are a number of other tales.
Pandit Isvarachandra Šāstrī, who has edited4 Bhoja's ‘Yukti-
kalpataru' refers to SMK as a work on Kāvyaśāstra in the Introduc-
tion. M. Krishnamachariar, in his ‘A History of Classical Sanskrit
Literature' has made a reference to Bhoja's SMK as a prose romance.5
Further, the same author has written a note on SMK in the Journal
of Sri Venkateşvara Oriental Institute which is interesting. It reads:
Śrngāramanjarī is a romance by King Bhoja Deva. Judging from
the variety of his works in poetry, this work will be of great interest.
Being in prose, it is a valuable addition to Gadya Kavyas.........

effort elicited an answer from the Dewan, Jaisalmer State, Jaisalmer.
The Dewan in his letter dated 20th July 1941 says that “the above
manuscript in very old Devanagari characters is available in Basta
No. 325 of the Jain Bhandar but it is reported to be incomplete
inasmuch as some of the first pages are missing, many of the pages
are not numbered and some are mixed up with another book.”
'It is hoped that other scholars and institutions will interest
themselves in securing a copy and publishing it and save it from
oblivion into which it has fallen for some centuries.'
It is interesting to trace how this Ms. came to see the light of
the day. Muni Jinvijayji had a keen desire to see this Ms. himself
ever since he read the description of it. In 1942 Muniji stayed for
five months at Jesalmere specially to examine the Bhandāras, and
made a thorough search for the Ms. At first he found about fifteen
to twenty leaves of the work and got them copied under the impres-
sion that this was all that could be found of the Ms. But while he
was examining other Mss. it struck his expert eyes that a number
of leaves in the same scribe's hand lay scattered in other works. He
therefore collected all such leaves and had a fresh copy made. From
one of the texts he found a fragment of the last page of this Ms, and
hoping then that a great number of fragments may be found, he
searched through the heaps of fragmentary pieces stored up in the
dark and stinking underground cellars of the Bhandara. The search
was successful; and he obtained a lot of material. With the idea of
publishing the work he brought it to Bombay and gave the leaves
for printing. But other preoccupations compelled him to leave the
publication half done.
In 1945 when I registered as a student for the degree of Ph.D. in
the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan under Muniji's guidance, he suggested
that I should take up the work of editing this Ms. The Ms. along
with the first copy of the leaves and the fragments were given to
me. The present work is the result of a critical study of the same
Ms.
The Age of the Ms.
The date of the composition of the SMK is given in the last
stanza, but unfortunately the folio is fragmentary and therefore it
is lost. The portion about the date of the composition reads:
...........TTTTI Tafaq: 1
कृतेयं भोजराजेन कथा [ शृंगारमंजरी ] ॥
But the Ms. is not dated. The condition of the palm leaf and the
style of writing indicate that it could not have been written later
than the 12th century. In the Bhandara there are other Mss. copied
by the same scribe, but unfortunately none of them too are dated.




Page 26****************************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION OF THE MS.
External Peculiarities of the Ms.: Description
The palmleaf Ms. is written in beautiful Devanāgari script, the
style of writing is similar to the Mss. of the 11th and the 12th cen-
turies. The leaves are smooth ind of a superior quality. A deep
black ink is used in writing and the characters of the script indicate
the use of a reed pen. The writing is distinct.
The complete text is in 158 folios, of which sixteen leaves are
missing and twenty-six are in fragments of various sizes. A small
fragment of folio 1 written on one side, and the left part of the last
folio have also been found. The leaves measure approximately 11.7"
in length and 2" in breadth. The leaves are divided into two parts
by a centre column. The left side is shorter than the right side, the
left measuring 4.7" and the right 6.9". The centre columns have
string holes which are uniform and not much enlarged. The edges
of some of the leaves are broken resulting in loss of letters in some
cases. The lines are regular and at the end are marked by vertical
double lines running across the whole breadth of leaves. There are
generally six lines on a page. In some cases where the leaves are
narrow in breadth there are five lines. The lines are written on both
the sides with about 52-55 letters in each line. It follows the usual
method of writing words continuously without a break up to the
end of the line. In some cases, as in folio 68a, where the leaf is
defective, lines are not completed and in folio 18b, the right hand
corner is left blank.
Punctuation
The simple vertical stroke, the danda is used for the separation
of single words or groups of words. But it is used very irregularly
and many times without significance. For example on folio 6a, lines
3-4 we have qafect Partenairit99345fafaraat I Hotelfasttrich-
Elfafa aegajal afet offencari A double vertical stroke is
usually used at the end of a sentence where a particular description
or a conversation is finished. The sign || G || usually marks the
change of topic or the end of a story. Occasionally at the end of
a story a double mark 11 3 li ll 33 11 is put which is rather unusual.
A sign like a horizontal comma is used when lines are not completed
due to some defect in the palm leaf before inscription. The sign
indicates continuation in the next line.
Pagination
The pagination is on the reverse of the leaves and both in the
numerals of numbers and letters as is found in the palm leaf Mss, of

Western India.? The letter numerals are written on the left hand
side and the number numerals on the right hand side.
Scribal Errors and Corrections
The degree of accuracy of the Ms. depends upon the scribe's
learning and carefulness. Of the two kinds of scribes one was the
scholar himself who prepared his own Ms. and the other was a pro-
fessional scribe. The professional scribe was only a master of the
technique of writing and had generally no idea about textual
accuracy, grammatical or otherwise. The scribe of this Ms. seems
to be only a professional one and therefore there are innumerable
scribal errors.
Scribal Errors
The subjoined list comprises of select examples of scribal errors.
The most frequent error consists in a mis-written syllable or a
letter. For example alfaar for fant, (fol. 80a, line 4), or again aja
for. Hoe (fol. 2b, line 3). Sometimes, a letter or syllable is mis-
placed. Thus TT:97774 for TT.TT1FT (28a, line 1). Or a letter or a
syllable is omitted. For instance to for sitter (fol. 38b, line 5).
Or a superfluous letter or syllable is inserted. Thus in the original
we have दशामनुभवम्नुत्कण्ठुल: for दशामनुभवन्नुत्कण्ठुल: (48b, line 4). Again
in the original Ms. from which this Ms. must have been copied, where-
ever there is halanta the scribe has understood and written 3; thus
मनाकु for मनाक, तदीयानु for तदीयान्. Occasionally there occur entire-
ly wrong words such as न वमस्यकरोत् for च मनस्थकरोत् । Besides these, in
some places the readings are so grossly wrong that it is difficult to
understand the real meaning thereof. Thus on folio 22a, line 4 we
read TF TaiTTE 3+1fa hatua FTTETTAT: TUT: which conveys
no sense. Such instances can be multiplied galore and the scribe
may be charged with careless and defective copying or perhaps the
Ms. before him might have been incorrect.
Corrections
In comparatively a small number of cases, the errors have been
corrected by the scribe himself. Certain signs are used in the Ms.
for the purpose of correcting an error in the text when a letter or a
word had to be altered, cancelled or inserted. Two minor strokes
are attached to a letter or a word to indicate alteration. Thus on
folio 106, line 6 the word which originally was written as fast is
altered to face by attaching two minor strokes to the cancelled
word. Similar is the procedure adopted for cancelling a letter.
7. Dr. Bühler is not quite correct when he says (Indian Paleography, I.A.
Vol. XXX, III Appendix, 1904), that this is a peculiarity of the Jaina Mss. of
Western India, for the same is seen even in the Brāhmanical and Buddhist Mss.
of the time.




Page 28****************************************************************************************
DESCRIPTION OF THE MS.
In order to cancel a full line two horizontal minor lines are
placed above and below the first and the last letter. Thus
f#fagfirgaft (#FESTETT FITTIT Pfarat Haa: 1 ] MTTTTT etc. (fol. 31b,
line 6).
The sign of Kākapada is used to indicate the omission of a word
or words. The omission is indicated in the margin above or below.
Excepting the first and the last lines the insertion also gives the
number of the line in which the insertion is made. Thus on fol. 32,
a full line is omitted in line no. 2. A Kākapada is put there and the
whole line is inscribed in small hand in the margin above, with No. 2
at the beginning and the Kākapada at the end. Another method
used in correcting the wrong letters is to deface them. As in folio
89a, line 4 and fol. 89b, line 5 one or two letters are defaced and the
correct letters written over them.
Orthographical Peculiarities
The Ms. has a few orthographical peculiarities. The confusion
between T, T, Q is so frequent that in the present edition corrections
are made without noting them in footnotes. Similar is the case with
the Visarga, which is at some places retained when it should be drop-
ped, and dropped when it should be retained. tep and o are inter-
mixed. Thus for example वख्या for वश्या; and विद्यमान for खिद्यमान.
ल्ल is written for एर्ण, for instance , श्रीपल्ली for श्रीपर्णी and ताम्रपल्ली for
Trentouff. At one place half conjuncts are confused, thus instead of 7
we have 4. Another peculiarity is the use of J7 for 9-IT for
yty which shows the scribe's familiarity with Prakritism.
Presentation of the Text
The text of SMK presented here is based on the only available
ms. described above. Liberty has been taken in removing and cor-
recting some scribal errors with a desire to reach genuine readings
without any pretension to improve upon the text. The text present-
ed, therefore, is the corrected one and the original corrupt readings
are given as footnotes. The missing letters that are supplied are put
within rectangular brackets, the emendations within circular
ones. Where there is some doubt about emendations, a mark of
interrogation is put along with the word. Where, however, the ori.
ginal readings convey no meaning and no suggestion could be made,
a mark of interrogation has been put in the text.
It has been mentioned already that the text, reconstituted as it
is, is not complete. Besides the loss of complete leaves there are
many leaves in fragments of various sizes. The approximate num-
ber of letters missing in each case is given in the footnotes.

Punctuations, sandhis and paragraphs are added for clearer
reading, and titles for stories are put in the beginning for reference
facility.
Title
The colophons give the title of the main work as well as the sub-
stories thus: इति महाराजाधिराजपरमेश्वरश्रीभोजदेवविरचितायां श्रृंगारमंजरीकथायां
fag FoTTFFFT ETAT I The titles of the sub-stories are after the names
of the nāyaka or the nāyikā generally, except in three stories where
titles are suggestive of the theme, namely, F347 TT (8th tale), 379TTTTT
(9th tale) and faut fait (10th tale).
The title of the main work is interesting. It is after the nāyikā
whose name is Srngāramañjarī. It seems that the choice of the name
is not accidental. It is suggestive. First of all it brings to our mind
Bhoja's other work, śrngāraprakāśa, in which he has elaborately
put forward his own theory of Śụngāra. His fancy for 'Rasa-Śrngāra'
probably led him to name his nāyikā Śụngāramañjari. Secondly, as
will be shown below, this text has some connection with his treat-
ment of the Śộngāra; and, thirdly the sentiment of śộngāra predo-
minates in this composition. Considering all this, it seems that the
name of the nāyikā, and hence the name of the work, has been
thoughtfully selected.
In the annals of Sanskrit Literature there are many works called
'śrngāramañjarī but the 'śệngāramañjarikathā', the present work,
is different from them.

CHAPTER 11
THE AUTHOR: BHOJADEVA
(i)
The Ms. of the SMK mentions Mahārājādhirāja Parameśvara
Śrī Bhojadeva as the author of the work, and there is sufficient in-
ternal evidence to confirm this.
Aufrecht in his 'Catalogus Catalogorum't mentions a large
number of works generally ascribed to this illustrious Paramāra
king, but the SMK does not figure therein. Aufrecht makes the cate-
gorical statement that not one of the list is an authentic work of
Bhoja. This assertion has been endorsed by modern scholars with-
out however adducing cogent arguments in support of their view.
What is more, the authenticity of not one of these works ascribed to
Bhoja has been doubted or impugned by any subsequent literary
evidence. On the contrary, the case of the Campū-Rāmāyana
proves that no effort has been made to father upon Bhoja the author-
ship of any work other than his own.2
In so far as the SMK is concerned the question presents, fortu-.
nately, little difficulty. There is sufficient internal evidence to
warrant the conclusion that it is Bhoja's composition. This conclu-
sion becomes better fortified when its kinship with the Sarasvati-
1. Part I, p. 418, part II, p. 95. Besides the two Prākrit Poems edited by Pischel
(El., Vol. VIII, pp. 241-260) Dr. N. P. Chakravarti records the find of two more
Prākrit Poems of Bhoja on slabs in Dhar (A.S.I., 1934-35, section III, Epi-
graphy, p. 60). In this the colophon is similar to that in our text: fc FETTETT-
धिराजपरमेश्वरश्रीभोजदेवविरचित: कोदण्ड . . . .
The editor, of course, doubts the authorship.
2. In the bulky volume of Campi-Rāmāyana which is also called "Bhoja-campū
there are seven kändas. The first five are written by Bhoja. The 6th by
Lakşmaņakavi and the 7th by Venkatādhvarin. At the end of the 6th kända
Lakşmaņakavi writes
प्राग्भोजोदितपञ्चकाण्डविहितानन्दे प्रबन्धे पुनः ।
काण्डो लक्ष्मणमूरिणा विरचितः षष्ठोऽपि जीयात् चिरम् ।।
And at the end of the 7th kāņda, Venkatādhvarin says the same, mentioning
his own contribution also
य: काण्डा निबबन्ध चम्पुविधया पञ्चापि भोजः कविः
यो वा षष्ठमचष्ट लक्ष्मणकविस्ताभ्यामुभाभ्यामपि ।

SRNGĀRAMAÑJARIKATHA
kanthābharana (SKĀ) and sșngāraprakāśa (SP), acknowledged by
common consent as Bhoja's works, is taken into account.
Let us deal with the internal evidence first. The colophons of
every Kathānikā uniformly read: इति महाराजाधिराजपरमेश्वरश्रीभोजदेव
facfaati etc. Next is the concluding verse of the SMK. After
paying homage to the Goddess Sarasvatī in four Prakrit gāthās, in
the fifth stanza, which is unfortunately not complete, Bhoja's author-
ship of the SMK is asserted. It reads thus:
..........CATTO Tf : 1
Fate FIFT FETT (TTKA57727] Il
The stanza definitely mentions Bhoja as the author of the present
work. If only the first pāda of the stanza had not been lost the
question of the date also would have been settled once for all.
In the body of the text also there is a reference to the authorship
of this king of the Paramāra family. In the description of a moun-
tain it is said: accerfa fafarlaatuaire (f. 135b, 5-6).
Besides there is the introductory scene, where Bhoja is described as
sitting in an informal assembly of friends, relatives and learned men.
They request him to narrate a Kathā. A short, but interesting dis-
cussion follows, from which we get information about certain
technical aspects of the Kathā as a literary form of composition.3
There is little probability of any other story-teller giving expression
to his own views in the name of Bhoja on this matter. On the other
hand, the description of the literary assemblage here given is a
faithful picture of such informal assemblages prevalent in those
days.
The SMK begins with the description of the city of Dhārā. The
Paramāras were well-known as excellent builders;4 and it is an
accepted fact that it was Bhoja who rebuilt Dhārā in the early part
of the eleventh century.5 Is it any wonder then that Bhoja should
call it the most distinguished city on earth and be tempted to praise
his own creation and lay the scene of the story in it? At one place,
while describing the various magnificent structures in the city of
Dhārā, the author also says that 'they put to shame all the old resi-
dences of the town (T atra TFTC56f2f1973f-a97f937f89a7-
mia TaasfogarafecafatietaTfa -perhaps a veiled reference
to his having rebuilt the city.
It has been mentioned in the previous chapter that the title of
the work is significant looking to the purpose of the text. The SMK
illustrates some technical aspects of rāga, which is an essential

element in furthering the sentiment of śộngāra. Its relation to the
SKA and the SP on this point will be discussed in Chapter
Five below. There are no two opinions regarding the common
authorship of both the SK, and the SP. In fact, Dr. Raghavan
has definitely stated that “considering the subjects dealt with in both
works, we can safely say that, as far as Poetics goes, the Śr. Pra.
adds substantially nothing new which is not contained in a brief
manner in the SKĀ itself. In this respect, one can call the Śr. Pra.
an elaboration, Vistāra or Vyāsa, of the Sangraha, the SKĀ.'€
Carrying this reasoning further on the basis of the statement in the
SP स च सात्त्विकादिनायक भेदात् स्थिरास्थिरत्वादितारतम्यात् प्रबन्धेन उपपाद्यमानो
UTSTTTT Tea, SMK, the present work, can be considered as the
prabandha which Bhoja composed for the purpose. It may be added
that the relative dates of these two works, namely, the SP and the
SMK, can also be determined from this evidence. Thus the corre-
lation of the three texts establishes beyond doubt that they all are
the works of Bhoja.

Bhojadeva, the illustrious king of the Paramāra dynasty, is the
most versatile king in Indian history. In c. 1010 A.C. he came to
the throne of Dhārā and died in 1054 A.C. Thus for about forty-four
years, he ruled, and within that period, as the Udaipur Prasasti des-
cribes him, 'he accomplished, ordered, gave and knew what was not
in the power of anybody else'.
A correct estimation of Bhoja's life-account is wanting not
because the darkness of oblivion surrounds him but because he is
too much in the limelight. Even during his life-time he had attained
the glory of a Sārvabhauma. His major achievements as estimated
by the historians and other literary records may be mentioned here.
He was first and foremost a man of great learning-a versatile
literary man, a polymath. The large number of books attributed to
him show that he had mastery over almost all the branches of know-
ledge, and that there was a conscious effort on his part to systematize
and popularize knowledge.
His literary courts also attest to his literary abilities and
patronage of learning. These courts were so well-known that other
states emulated his example. Scholars from various parts of the

country flocked to his court, and we read how Bilhaņa regretted his
not having attended Bhoja's court. 10 Bhoja with the help of his
court poets and panditas , brought the studies of Śāstras up-to-date.
He systematized and standardized the study of all branches of know-
ledge. The temple of Sarasvatī, known as 'Bhojaśālā', was verily a
University, and it was a meeting place of great poets, scholars,
critics and accomplished men.11
We are told that the court of Cālukya Jayasimha of Gujarāta
was modelled on Bhoja's court. The Prabhāvakacarita records an
interesting episode that when Siddharāja Jayasimha triumphantly
entered the city of Ujjayini, he found all the students studying
Bhoja's Grammar and other works day and night, and the libraries
were full of Bhoja's works. 12
In later days his courts passed into legends and were the objects
of fancy for later writers like Ballāla who, for instance, in
the exuberance of his admiration for Bhoja defied history and
gathered Kālidāsa, Bāna, Bhavabhūti and Māgha at Bhoja's court.
Secondly he was a great builder. Of his magnificent monu-
ments—-cities, temples and lakes, we have traces even today. And
his two bulky volumes of Samarānganasūtradhāra, dealing with
various aspects of town-planning and architecture, prove his interest
in the subject.
Lastly, he was a great military leader, always busy conquering,
making alliances, forming confederacies and building up a great
Empire. During one period of his life, when his political power was
supreme he had under his sway a considerable part of India, for
Indraratha of the Kesari dynasty of Orissa, and the Western Cālukyas
of Kalyāņi were defeated by him. In the South he had extended his
hands of friendship to the Cola kings and had conquered Karņāțaka
and Konkaņa. He had also helped the other Hindu kings in driving
back Mahmūd of Ghaznā.13

And thus looking to his strong and extensive political power
the claim of the Udaipur Prasasti that he possessed the earth from
the Kailāsa to the Malaya hills and from the setting to the rising
sun is not an exaggeration.
The SMK supports what the historians record. He is compared
with the great literary men like Subandhu, Bhāsa, Guņādhya and
Bāņa. A glowing tribute is paid to his intellectual acumen and states-
manship in comparing him with great men like Bșhaspati, Uśanas,
Uddhava, Cāņakya and Dharmakirti. Of such a learned and mighty
king, the footstool was reddened by the rubies studded in the crowns
of the constantly bowing kings; the creeper of fame rose to the skies;
Goddess Sarasvati sought refuge and the Glory of Victory sought
asylum.

CHAPTER III
A SUMMARY OF CONTENTS
The SMK is a Kathā. The frame-tale is preceded by an Intro-
duction which tells us how, when and by whom the Kathā came to
be narrated.
Once upon a time when spring was almost over and when the
heat of the sun was increasing, King Bhojadeva, who was seated on
the bejewelled seat of the dhārā-grha, was requested by his friends
and admirers to narrate to them a new tale. After a little hesitation,
the king began:
Here there is the beautiful city of Dhārā. King Bhojadeva is
the ruler: His favourite courtesan is sșngāramañjarī, who is
accomplished in all the sciences and arts necessary for a courtesan of
her standing. Her beauty and wealth add to her good fortune but
she lacks a sense of discrimination in attending to the people who
come to her. Her mother Vişamaśīlā is proud of her heritage, but
fears that śșngāramañjarī might some day be cheated by rogues and
ruin the good reputation of her family. So one day Vişamāśīlā frankly
speaks out her fears to Śộngāramañjarī and instructs her that since
men have different natures and leanings in the world, she should be
more discriminating. Vșāmāśīlā also describes the different forms
of attachments of men and expounds some principles to be followed
by a courtesan. This is the frame-tale. The teaching is imparted by
illustrative stories which form the thirteen kathānikās. Each
kathānikā has a moral which is enunciated at the outset and explain-
ed at the end.
The First Tale of Ravidatta
Vişamaśīlā: Men are ruined because of their deep attachment
--nilīrāga--for courtesans. Thus:
In the town of Kuņdinapura dwelt a learned Brāhmaṇa named
Somadatta. In old age he begot a son by favour of the Sun God and
the child was therefore called Ravidatta. By the time Ravidatta was
sixteen, he had mastered the Vedas and all the Šāstras; and his father
instructed him in all the arts, especially the art of harlotry.
Once, after the death of his parents, when it was Spring time,
a group of Vițas urged him to attend the festive procession of the
fish-bannered god Madana (i.e. God of Love). He remembered the
advice of his elders, but goaded on by his friends, he proceeded to the
mansion of the God of Love. There he saw a lovely courtesan
Vinayavatī. On seeing her he stood dumb as if stricken by the

13
abundance of Madana's arrows. Vinayavati saw his youthful form
and opulent appearance and glanced at him frequently as if
enamoured of him. Though till that day Ravidatta was insensible
to the play of love, he was charmed by the courtesan's amorous
glances. After duly performing the worship of Madana, he left the
place with his mind fixed on her.
The courtesan also returned home thinking of him. She had
secured a good prey; and she did not wish to let it escape. She sent
her friend Sangamikā to tell Ravidatta of her love and bring him to
her house. When Sangamikā met Ravidatta, she spoke to him about
it and invited him; he was at first indecisive, but the fire of youth
outweighed his judgment, wisdom, modesty and learning and he
went to the courtesan's house.
Vinayavati was quick to understand his deep attachment-
nilirāga--and gradually divested him of all his wealth. When Ravi.
datta became a pauper she sent a message to him through Sangamikā
that a certain merchant named Vasudatta had arrived from Suvarņa.
dvīpa with much wealth and was ready to give it all to Vinayavati
if he could but spend one night with her. And therefore Ravidatta
was asked not to come to her place for two or three days.
The dull-witted Ravidatta took her at her word and stayed home.
After a few days he went to her house, but was turned out. He met
Sangamikā but she showed no signs of recognition. He made repeat-
ed efforts to gain entrance to Vinayavati's house but was rebuked,
laughed at by her servants and driven out every time. But his
attachment for her did not lessen. He passed the remaining days
of his life thinking of her and thought himself fortunate whenever
he had the opportunity of seeing her,
Vişamasilā. Thus O daughter, the secret teachings of harlotry
yielded good results after the nature of nilīrāga was known. As a
cloth dyed in indigo does not fade even when washed by different
things like soda, a person of nilirāga does not give up his deep
attachment even when ruined in a hundred ways.
The Second Tale of Vikramasimha
Śộngāramañjari: Mother, you have spoken about ihe nīlīrāga
My curiosity increases. Please speak to me about the mañjişthārāga
Vişamaśīlā said:
In the city of Tāmalipti, there dwelt a prince named Vikrama
simha. One day loitering in the locality of the courtesans he saw
Mālatikā, the daughter of the bawd Ekadaſștrā. Mālatikā was not
independent for she depended for her livelihood on a merchant
named Vasudatta.




Page 37****************************************************************************************
14
ŚRNGĀRAMAÑJARIKATHA
As soon as Vikramasimha saw Mālatikā he felt an irresistible
attraction towards her. He sent his servant Priyamvadaka to her to
find out the means by which he could meet her. In answer to his
request Mālatikā told him of her dependency on Vasudatta due to
a contract, and asked him to wait till she found an excuse to meet
him. He waited patiently throughout the rainy season. Then
Mālatikā sent her messenger Madhukarikā to fetch him. He went,
was gratified and returned after giving her a lot of wealth.
Some days passed and Vikramasiſha was offended. (The text
is lost here and we do not know the exact circumstances which gave
offence to Vikramasimha). He stopped going to her and sending her
gifts. And his attachment for her gradually lessened.
Vişamaśīlā: Thus O daughter, as a cloth dyed in the Mañjişthā
does not completely lose its colour but fades away as you wash it,
persons of mañjişthārāga become gradually detached when offended.
Therefore such persons should not be troubled.
The Third Tale of Mādhava
Śrngāramañjarſ: Mother, I remain unsatiated in hearing these
tales that you have narrated. Therefore tell me a tale about a man
of kusumbharāga.
And Vişamaśīla said:
In the city of Vidiśā there dwelt a bawd called Bhujangavāgurā.
Her daughter was Kuvalayāvali. She was reputed for her youthful
beauty and graces. To that city one day came Madhava, a student
of the Vedas. He had returned from Simhaladvipa after amassing
considerable wealth. He came to know of Kuvalayāvalī and paying
her liberally, he spent a night with her. She was much pleased with
him and sent for him now and then.
Many days passed; Mādhava's wealth slowly flowed into
Kuvalayāvali's coffers. When he had been reduced to the state of a
pauper Mādhava thought of going away before his name was com-
pletely ruined. To encourage him as it were, the monsoon came to
an end and autumn, the proper season for travel, set in. Madhava
now decided to start for the Malaya country in search of wealth and
took leave of the bawd. Kuvalayāvali wept and made all efforts to
keep him back, but it was futile. While leaving, Madhava left with
her his rich upper garment. Both the mother and daughter followed
him for some distance and then the bawd suggested that he should
give to her daughter some token of remembrance. He replied he
had no such thing, but the bawd insisted—“Please give this dress
of yours as a token of remembrance. Pressing the garment to her
heart, Kuvalayāvalī will pass her days hoping for your return."

Mūdhava answered: “I will do as you say. But there are many
travellers on the way and I feel shy. On leaving this road I will give
it to you”.
After going some more distance, he saw a lonely spot and he
called the bawd. Throwing her on the ground he quickly and forcibly
cut off her nose and ears. While she lay tossing and wailing.
Mādhava said to her: "Such is a token of remembrance I give you
that you will never forget it”, and thinking his purpose had been
served he went his way.
Vişamaśīlā: As a cloth dyed in kusumbha is not fit for heat
and washing, persons of kusumbharāga soon become estranged and
bring about evil. The wealth of such people therefore should be
taken away without giving offence to them.
Śrngāramañjarī: Mother, my curiosity increases. Therefore
tell me about all the things you mentioned.
The Fourth Tale of Suradharman
Vişamasilā: Well, listen about the means of getting hold of a
person of haridrārāga.
On the bank of the Ganges is Hastigrāma, a village of the
Brāhmaṇas. There dwelt a poor man called Suradharman. He knew
of no means of acquiring wealth; so he decided to worship the sea,
the store-house of jewels. Every day he would go with flowers,
offer them to the sea, spend the whole day there and return at
eventide. Many years thus passed. One day the Lord of the sea took
pity on him and gave him an invaluable jewel. Suradharman was
pleased and returned home. Having obtained such an invaluable
treasure he was afraid of losing it, so he tore open his thigh, hid it
there, and assuming the role of a mad man roamed about muttering
only "Mother knows".
Wandering thus, he came to Ujjayini after many days. King
Vikramāditya ruled there. He had a famous courtesan named Deva-
dattā. Under the pretext of pilgrimage, Devadattā used to search
for rich men fit to be fleeced. Once she saw Suradharman. Noticing
the contrast between his form and his peculiar behaviour, she knew
for certain that the person was a rogue and had assumed the pose
of a mad man only to hide something very precious; therefore she
spoke to him; but to her question he only answered, 'Mother knows'.
Desirous of knowing the truth, Devadattā brought him home.
She tried her utmost to worm out the secret from him. She neglect-
ed even the king, but Suradharman would speak nothing else but
"Mother knows”.
Thus passed six months. One day it occurred to Suradharman
that a long stay would infatuate him and he would be prompted to




Page 39****************************************************************************************
16
ŚRNGARAMANJARIKATHA
give away everything; it would be best therefore to go away. But
he could not speak out his desire. Therefore he folded his hands,
pointed towards his own country and repeated 'Mother knows.'
Devadattā persuaded him in many ways but he would not stay back.
Therefore she had to permit him to go.
It was a defeat for Devadattā, and she felt offended. She resolv-
ed that she would make a last effort to call him back and if she
failed, she would immolate herself in fire. Accordingly she called
two other girls and instructed them as follows: They should both
follow Suradharman. After covering two yojanas, one of them
should go ahead and come from the opposite direction towards him.
The other should walk behind him. On meeting each other they
should converse about the happenings at Ujjayini. In the course of
conversation it should be given out that the courtesan Devadattā, who
had fallen in love with a mad man, had died because he left her, and
her whole family was desirous of putting an end to their lives. The
rehearsed talk had the desired effect on Suradharman. He stopped,
told them that he was the wretch who killed Devadattā, and ran
back to her house.
Arrangements in connection with the bogus death had been
made meticulously. Her dead body lay on one side and her people
were weeping. On seeing him, the bawd cried aloud and rebuked him
for destroying the happiness of her household. Suradharman was
distressed. He decided to follow Devadattā so he opened his thigh
and gave the jewel to the bawd. The same moment the bawd spoke
into the ears of Devadattā ‘rise', and Devadattā slowly opened her
eyes, started breathing and stretched her limbs. All were in ecstasy
and a rumour was spread that Devadattā had been carried away by
death, but was recovered again. Suradharman and Devadattā now
happily passed two or three days together.
One night due to the force of habit the words ‘Mother knows
escaped Suradharman. Devadattā asked: “Do I know it or your
mother?” Suradharman folded his hands and said, “Mother knows
not. You alone know everything.” Hearing that, Devadattā kicked
him out saying "If I know everything get out from here."
While going he pitifully begged of her to give him some provi-
sion for the journey. She gave him 2 palas and drove him out.
Vişamaśīlā: Thus O daughter, even at the loss of her own
wealth, Devadattā looked after him. Knowing his haridrārāga she
quickly took away everything and drove him out.
As haridrā fades in the heat of the sun and so on, such men of
haridrārāga become averse by threats and the like; therefore they
should be drained of their wealth by resorting to extraordinary
means.

The Fifth Tale of Devadattā
Vişamaśīlā: Moreover, daughter, I have told you that to win
over a person you should understand him first:
King Vikramaditya of Ujjayini had a courtesan called Deva-
dattā. One night as they were enjoying the moonlit night, the king
asked her how courtesans should be dealt with and how they suc-
cessfully acquire other's wealth. Devadattā showed her aversion
to answering this question. To avoid the query and yet to entertain
him, she started relating to him a strange incident she had experienc-
ed only the day before.
Devadattă said that while she was going from there to the main
gate, all of a sudden she saw a wonderful horse, and a handsome
young man mounted on it. He signalled to her and she mounted
the horse. The horse flew up into the sky. After a long journey
the horse came down and they dismounted. There was a mansion
which they entered. She saw there a beautiful lady weeping.
Another man came with a whip. They both asked Devadattā to act
as a love messenger to bring about a union between the man with
the whip and the lady. She refused and the man with the whip
started beating her. Devadatta did not give in, but went on saying
"The feet of the conqueror of the three worlds, King Vikramāditya,
is my shelter." Surprisingly enough, as she called out to him, the
others felt as if the king had come. They were scared to death and
fled leaving her alone. She did not see where the horse went away,
but she found herself again on the palace ground.
On hearing this narrative Vikramāditya repeatedly asked Deva-
dattā whether it was true. And Devadattā swore by the king that
it was entirely true. The king was pleased with her and told his
elephant-keeper to give his second best elephant to her as a gift
together with four crores of gold pieces, rich ornaments and gar-
ments.
Devadattā smiled and said to the king that she would take an-
other elephant from him after they retired and then revealed to him
the secret; “Sire, you asked me how my class of people acquire
wealth well, this is how they get it”.
"Well done, Devadattā”, said Vikramăditya, “You have instruct-
ed me in a fascinating manner. You have well raised the traditional
reputation of your class”. So saying, being gratified, he doubled
the gifts.
Vişamaśilā: Thus oh daughter, acquisition of wealth is certain
if you act according to the desire of other people. The truth is that
there is nothing that flattery does not attain,

The sixth tale of Lāvanyasundarī
Vişamaśīlā: Moreover, oh daughter, I have already told you that
for those who, after resorting to great and valorous persons, try to
obtain their desired ends at the risk of self-sacrifice it is not difficult
to gain their own ends. I will tell you about it:
In the town of Ahicchatra dwelt a powerful king called Vaj-
ramukuța. In the same town also dwelt a rich oilman called
Ghuda with his wife Lāvanyasundari. The couple were very happy.
One day, while the king was passing by Ghuda's house he saw
Lāvanyasundarī. Her loveliness intoxicated him and he desired to
possess her. Learning from his spies that she was the wife of
Ghuda, the oilman, Vajramukuța arrested Ghuda under a false charge
of adulteration in oil. For his release the oilman offered to pay
enormous sums, but the king did not release him. Lävanyasundarſ
then realised the king's real intentions and told her husband that
he should try to free himself from the king's clutches by offering
him whatever he wanted. Accordingly, the oilman asked the king
and he was asked to get a hundred elephants within six months.
Considering her husband's freedom more important than her own
reputation, she took along with her a large retinue and paraphernalia
befitting a noble and rich courtesan; and having in mind the valo-
rous King Sāhasāňka, she started for Ujjayini.
After a few days she reached Ujjayinī. She took up her resi-
dence on the banks of the Siprā and had the rumour bruited about
her that she was a courtesan. The rumour, in due course, reached
the ears of the king. As she anticipated, he sent his spies to verify
the truth. When they attested to its truth, the king passed by her
house under the pretext of hunting and had a look at her. His mind
was immediately captivated by her beauty and charm. And he sent
his man Mukharaka to fetch her. She gladly came to the king's
palace and stayed there.
In the morning the king spoke to Bhattamātrgupta, his wise
adviser, about the love of Lāvanyasundarī. Bhattamātrgupta warn-
ed him not to trust her for she was after all a harlot. Vikrama
tested her in various ways but she always proved loyal to him, and
he refused to believe Bhāțțamatſgupta's words. All this naturally
came to the ears of Lāvanyasundari. She feared and respected
Bhattamātrgupta but the prescribed time was coming to an end and
she had to act soon.
So one day Lāvanyasundarī took courage. She came to where
the king and his wise counsellor were sitting, and rebuked the king
for regarding her true love as harlotry. In a huff she entered the
bedroom and with a dagger cut off her head. Full of misappre-
hensions Vikrama followed her after some time only to see her lying

dead with her head severed. He was stunned and called Bhatta-
māt?gupta, “Do you see the end of harlotry?” he asked. “Yes, Your
Majesty', replied Bhattamătſgupta, “but what shall I say? This too
is harlotry”. The king was enraged; disregarding the worthy
Bhattamātřgupta he took her body to the temple of the Goddess
Āśāpurā. He prepared to cut off his head as an offering to the god-
dess who was pleased with his courage and love and granted him his
desire, and revived Lāvanyasundari. All were pleased and the king
returned with her to the city.
Days passed happily. One evening as they were seated on an
ivory balcony, they saw a lordly elephant roaming at will. The
king was joyous at the sight of the elephant and asked Lāvanya-
sundarī to ask for a boon. First she refused, but ultimately said:
"All that is your is mine. What shall I ask for? But since child-
hood I have a great fascination for elephants. Therefore give me
one hundred elephants". She also requested him that this gift to
her should be announced everywhere. The king did as desired.
After two or three days Lāvaṇyasundarī stood before the king
with folded hands and asked him to free her, for such, she said, was
the convention of the courtesans. The king was surprised. He
asked about it and Lāvanyasundarī told the entire story. The king
allowed her to go back and she spent the remaining years of her
life in enjoyment with Ghuda.
The seventh tale of Cheating Bawd
Vişamašilā: One must protect oneself from rogues. Thus:
A Brāhmaṇa begot two sons in old age. They were called Vişnu-
gupta and Somadatta. When they grew up they desired to go to
another country; and so, one summer they set out. Journeying
they came to the forest of Vindhya. Their provisions were exhaust-
ed as they had to pass seven days crossing the forest. They were
tired; thirst and hunger afflicted them. After some time with great
difficulty they reached a lake with a banian tree on its bank. They
passed the day there and at night lighted a fire to keep off wild
beasts and stood on guard for one watch alternatively
During the third watch of the night, when Somadatta was on
guard he heard a pair of pigeons talking. The female pigeon sug-
gested that they throw themselves into fire and help the poor stary-
ing Brāhmaṇa boys. The pigeon agreed and spoke of a prophecy
made by a sage at their birth that he who would eat the male pigeon
would become a king and he who would eat the female pigeon would
get five-hundred gold pieces every day. Then they threw them-
selves into fire. The wonderstruck Somadatta drew them out of
the fire, woke up his brother and told him about them. He gave

his brother the male pigeon and himself ate the she pigeon. Soma-
datta then went to sleep. In the morning he found five-hundred
gold pieces by his side and they were convinced about the truth of
the matter. Joyously they proceeded on their journey the next day,
but soon lost sight of each other and went different ways.
According to the story, the elder boy became the king of
Magadha. The young, Somadatta, came to Kāñcí. In that city
dwelt a bawd Makaradamştrā and her daughter Karpūrikā. Soma-
datta spent many days in Karpūrikā's company and gave her untold
gold. No supplicant was ever turned sway by him and yet his
wealth never seemed to lessen. The bawd was curious and asked
Karpūrikā to find out the source of his wealth. The secret about
the she-pigeon came out. The bawd gave her some emetic and
he vomitted out the pigeon. The bawd immediately ate it. Thence
she got gold every day and Somadatta's gain stopped. He repented
of his mistake and set out on his travels again.
On the way he heard about a new king of Magadha. Convinced
that this must be his own brother he went to him. He stayed
there for a few days, obtained considerable wealth and returned
to Kāñci in order to take revenge on Karpūrikā.
Karpūrikā was attracted by his wealth and splendour. When
pressed by her to tell the source of his wealth he said that it was
due to siddhi he had obtained by practising penance at Śrſparvata.
Karpūrikā's greed increased. She suggested a bargain: She would
give the pigeon back if he would transfer the siddhi to her. Soma-
datta was not to be cheated this time. He struck a successful bar-
gain by taking the pigeon along with all her wealth and giving
in return the said siddhi. He sent away all the gold to his house,
ate the pigeon and asking the royal retinue to wait upon the courte-
san for five days went away.
For five days Karpürikā enjoyed the service of the king's men,
and was then disappointed. Her household returned full of sorrow
and repentance. While Somadatta went to Magadha to his brother
and lived happily ever after,
Vişamaśīlā: Therefore my child, rogues should never be troubl-
ed, for when irritated they act in such a way that they take away even
the previously earned wealth.
The eighth tale of the woman' love
Vişamaśīlā: I have said before that one's self should be pro-
tected from love as from a tiger. I will illustrate that to you.
In the town of Pundravardhana there dwelt a rich merchant
Vasudatta, whose only son Ratnadatta had in a short time mastered
all the lores and sciences under the teacher Vasubhūti. When

Ratnadatta grew up he did not like the business of his father and
desired to earn his own living by serving a powerful king. He set
out with his servant Subandhu for Mānyakheța where king Pratāpa-
mukuţa ruled.
He took a thousand pieces of gold with him in case of emergency,
but decided to live by his earnings on the way. He averred that
courtesans would invite him and will not abandon him, and if they
did not call him or abandon him he would put an end to his life..
After some days they came to the city of Vidiśā. In the temple
of Bhāillasvāmidevapura he was noticed by the courtesan Lāvanya-
sundari who had come to dance there. She immediately fell in love
with him and sent her friend Bakulikā after him. He was found
sleeping in a lonely temple being attended upon by his servant.
Bakulikā brought him to Lāvanyasundari's house. That very night
Lāvaṇyasundari was so charmed by him that abandoning thoughts
of all other men, she became attached only to him.
But early morning Ratnadatta left her and went to a gaming
house. Lāvanyasundari was perturbed on not seeing him and sent
Bakulikā to bring him back to her. He came back and that night
Lāvanyasundari asked him about his whereabouts and where he
intended to go. Ratnadatta spoke to her of his desire to join the
services of the king Pratāpamukuța of Mānyakheța. She knew she
would not be able to stay without him. So she consulted a bawd
and both of them accompanied him.
After many days they reached the town of Punyapathaka.
Under a mango tree outside the town Ratnadatta went to sleep
placing his head on Lāvanyasundari's lap. It then occurred to the
bawd that Lāvanyasundari had no intention of returning, and there-
fore she conceived a plot by which Ratnadatta would be killed and
Lāvanyasundari would return with her. Accordingly she went to
the king Suradharman of the town and told him that their daughter
was being taken away by a thug. The king first sent his police officer,
then a few courtiers and then himself went to see whether the bawd
was speaking a lie. He found that the girl was willingly going away
with the youth. He was so pleased with Ratnadatta that he offered
him half his kingdom. But Ratnadatta only spoke of his desire to
serve the king and went his way.
Then he came to Mānyakheța, and put up with a courtesan called
Citralekhā. Next day Ratnadatta went in search of a job. He told
Lāvanyasundari that she was free for four days. Unfortunately the
king saw Lāvanyasundari, was enamoured of her and called her to
the palace. She had to obey, but she agreed to take gifts from him
only on the condition that she would be allowed to go away when-
ever she wanted.

ŚRNGARAMAÑJARIKATHA
The fourth day came. It was the day of the return of Ratna-
datta. The king called her for dancing. Reluctantly she obeyed
the king after instructing her maid that she should be called back
as soon as Ratnadatta was seen coming. As she started dancing she
saw her maid, so taking leave of the king she hurried back
to her place. The king was so curious to see the man with
whom Lavanyasundari was so madly in love. He came and
hid behind a latticed window. When Ratnadatta came Lävanya-
sundarī came forward with water to wash his feet. But from her
dress Ratnadatta realised that she had become the King's courtesan.
And when she proceeded to wash his feet he said “Do not wash my
feet. You are my mother. You are the king's wife". When the
king came out of the hiding place Ratnadatta turned to him and said
that he should not come there but go to his palace. He had come
to join his services and would follow his instructions then, but not
now. The king was pleased with his boldness and returned.
Ratnadatta was then invited to the court. His services were
much appreciated and he stayed with the king enjoying his favours,
and Lāvaṇyasundarī was soon forgotten.
Vişamasilā: Therefore oh daughter, those women who become
too much attached to men destroy themselves and lose their wealth.
The ninth tale of love on both the sides
Vişamaśīlā: I have narrated to you the nature of one-sided love.
I will now describe to you love on both the sides.
In Uragapura ruled king Samarasimha. He had a courtesan
named Aśokavati, who had mastered sword dancing. All the King's
feudatories liked her but her heart was set upon sāmanta Chadda-
laka.
Once during winter when all the feudatories had assembled, the
king sent for Asokavati to give a performance of sword dancing.
Hoping that Chaddalaka would be present she put on her best
apparel and went to the court. On the way she vowed to God that
if Chaddalaka would see her today she would offer him kumkum
and flowers. As she was coming she also saw the wish-fulfilling
god Ganapati, and with her heart full of joy she came to the court.
She began dancing. Her dancing was full of rhythm and grace,
but her eyes sought none but Chaddalaka. Chaddalaka was not to
be seen anywhere and she was dismayed. Her 'enthusiasm waned,
her steps became unsteady and she lost all her grace. The dancing
teacher was quick to notice the change in her. He feared she would
lose her balance and throw herself on the sword, so he told the king
to stop the show. The king did so, called Aśokavatſ and rebuked

her. But love had made her bold and she acknowledged her love
for Chaddalaka and was ready to suffer any punishment. The king
however, freed her asking her not to be so bold again. But to his
surprise he saw her go to the house of Chaddalaka.
The king now desired to break this bond of love. He therefore
invited another handsome youth called Sundaraka to entice her.
And she fell a victim to his charms. She invited him to her house
and spent a night with him in dalliance. Sundaraka had brought
a 'pattanika' with himself, in which all that passed between them
was recorded. Next morning Asokavatī repented for giving way
to a fleeting passion and thus being untrue to her true love. Sunda-
raka witnessed her repentance, and sad at heart returned to the
king.
To cnd the game the king then called Chadựalaka when his
minister Tikkapaika was present and showed him the 'pattanikā'.
Chaddalaka understood that it was only a king's plot to break his
love. But he wanted to test Asokavati. He therefore, made a plan
with Tikkapaika. According to the plan Tikkapaika put on the dress
of a pāśupata mendicant and came near the house of Aśokavatī.
She saw him and was surprised to see him in this attire. When
asked to explain Tikkapaika said that as Chaqdalaka had died in a
battle against the king of Kaccha he was aggrieved and has become a
mendicant.
On hearing of the death of Chaddalaka, Aśokavatī, like a she-
elephant struck by lightning, fell down dead. The news was con-
veyed to Chaddalaka. In the meantime there came to the assembly
of the king the news of Asokavati's death on hearing the canard of
Tikkapaika. There was an uproar. Sundaraka considered himself
to be the cause of her death and repenting of his wickedness put an
end to his life by throwing himself into fire.
Chaddalaka also on receiving the news became mad with grief.
He rushed to the cremation ground and lit a pyre for himself and
threw himself into the fire.
The news of the death of three innocent people reached the
king's ears. He realized his mistake and remorse filled his heart.
He ran to the Goddess Āśāpurā and desired to offer his head as well.
She prevented him from the rash act, and at his request revived all
the dead persons. The king then gave Aśokavatī to Chaddalaka and
made Sundaraka the master of four thousand villages.
Vişamašīlā: Thus, O daughter, there are cases where due to love,
courtesans have lost their wealth and lives too. Therefore as a rule
one should keep away from love as from a tiger.

The tenth tale of a serpent
Vişamaśīlā: Child, there is nothing that a harassed man refrains
from doing. Listen to this:
Śrutadhara, a learned Brāhmaṇa, lived in the city of Kausâmbi.
He had a son named Vinayadhara. By the time Vinayadhara was
sixteen he had completed his education.
Once during the spring festival he had gone to the temple of
Kālapriyadeva where he saw Anangavati, a courtesan. He made
her acquaintence and started frequenting her place. He passed
many happy days in her company. In course of time Vinayadhara
was reduced to poverty, but to Anangavati he was dearer than life.
The bawd, however, did not like Anangavati's attachment to a
pauper so, one day she drove him out. Under some pretext or other
Vinayadhara gained entrance to her house. The bawd hated him,
again and again drove him out and admonished Anangavati also for
allowing him to come.
One day it so happened that while Vinayadhara was coming
from his house he saw a serpent recently dead. Thinking that it
would serve his purpose he picked it up. Borrowing money from
a friend he came to Anangavati's house. At midnight when all
were asleep he woke up, went up to the bawd, spread the snake on
her body and pinched her nose and lips. When the bawd shrieked
he ran up to her and with a stick hit hard the snake lying on her
body. When the servants came running and put on the lights, he
pointed to the snake, and said the stings should be rubbed off.
Fearing that poison would spread in her body the bawd cried out
'cut it off, cut it off' and he quickly cut off her nose as well as the
lips. In the morning felicitations were offered for saving the
mother's life. But to the poor bawd the congratulatory drum sound-
ed indeed like the heralding of death and she writhed in pain night
and day.
Vişamaśīlā: Thus, oh daughter, it is difficult to describe how
rogues act when harassed.
The eleventh tale of Malayasundarī:
Vişamaśīlā: In my opinion on one should be insulted. There is
nothing that the insulted men refrain from doing. To explain:
Pratāpasimha was a feudatory in the court of king Mahendra-
pāla of Kānyakubja. He was ugly and passionate.
In the same town lived also a bawd by name Dhondā with her
daughter Malayasundarī. One day Pratāpasimha came to sleep
with her. The next morning when he rose to go, he saw a child
sleeping with her. It was Malayasundari's sister's child, but when
Pratāpasimha enquired whose child it was, she teased him by assert-
kubja. He ad also a bawa bypasimha came tao

ing that it was hers. This irritated him and he threw her on the
ground and like a 'tiger scratched her whole body and pulled out a
lot of her hair. Then he went away. When the bawd and the others
came Malayasundari covered herself and lay on the bed.
Malayasundari was a favourite of the king; so the bawd ran
up to him and related the incident. The king was furious and
enquired as to who did it. Pratāpasimha said he had done it and
would explain why he did it if Malayasundari was brought there.
Malayasundari came after much persuasion. Pratāpasimha then
said that he bore all her teasing because he loved her very much.
But when she said the child was hers he could not tolerate it. All
this was done out of extreme attachment, and the king could judge
for himself whether he was right or wrong.
The king was pleased with him and gave him presents, while
Malayasundari became an object of ridicule for others.
Vişamasilā: Thus insulted men leave no means of ridiculing women.
The twelfth tale of Pamarāka,
Vişamasilā: Without a just cause enmity with dhūrtas should
not be created.
(The thread of the story is lost because only fragments of folios con-
taining the story are preserved.)
Vişamaśīlā: Therefore O daughter, try no deceit with a clever
man. If you deceive him you must bear the results, otherwise you
become an object of ridicule.
The thirteenth tale of Müladeva
Vişamaśīlā: Moreover daughter, rāga should always be protected.
It is threefold: one born on hearing, one on seeing and one after
union. All the three should be abandoned. For by these even
women of good families become objects of ridicule. Therefore sȚți-
rāga and drsti-rāga should be kept at a distance like the virulent
poison of a snake. Listen about it:
In Ujjayini ruled kind Vikramāditya. Mūladeva, the dhūrta,
stayed with him. He was very dear to the king. One day when
the king insistently asked him why he had not married Müladeva
replied that women are fickle in their love, and therefore he did
not marry. The king persuaded him to believe that women are
the chief source of happiness and the main support in a house-
holder's life. Mūladeva was somehow convinced and got married.
After some time Mūladeva found out that his wife was carrying
on with some other man. Not only that, the king's chief queen,

Cella-Mahādevi also was deceiving the king by going out every
night to her paramour, the king's elephant-driver. One night the
queen was late in going to the elephant driver and he lashed her
with a rope; the queen however pacified him and spent the night
with him.
The next day, the completely disillusioned Müladeva proved
the guilt of his wife and the queen to the king. The king punished
them all and threw the queen into prison after cutting off her nose
and ears.
Vişamasilā: Therefore, O daughter, there are courtesans of noble
character, and there are women of good families who fall in love at
first sight, and regardless of life or wealth have relations with other
men. Therefore the three kinds of love should be abandoned.
In our family which shines bright in the world like the sun
there is not a single taint in the shape of being cheated by others.
Therefore you should act in such a way that no one would be able
to deceive you.

CHAPTER IV
A CRITICAL APPRECIATION OF THE SMK
The Literary Genre to which the SMK Belongs
A summary of the SMK has already been given. It will enable
us to examine the work, determine its nature and evaluate its merits.
The first important question to consider is the literary genre to
which the SMK belongs. Examined in the light of Bhoja's own
statements, as will be shown later, the SMK can be described broadly
as a Kathā written in Sanskrit prose having some of the peculiari-
ries of the Akhyāyikā form of composition. In the colophon the
work is called a Kathā. Katha is one of the two main divisions of
the gadya-kavyas or prose compositions, the other being Akhyiyikā.?
Rhetoricians have made general distinctions between the Kathū
and the Akhyāyikā thus:
1. The Akhyāyikā gives the description of the poet's family in
prose, while the Kathā gives the same in verse.
2. The Akhyāyikā gives the description of topics like the
abduction of girls, battles etc., while the Kathā is silent about it.
3. The Akhyāyikā gives facts of actual happenings, the hero
narrating about himself, while in the Kathā the subject-matter is
imaginary and is narrated by a third person, and not the hero.
4. The chapters of the Akhyāyikī are called Ucchvāsas while
the Kathā may be optionally divided into Lambakas and it may have
emboxment of stories.
5. In the Akhyāyikā there are verses in the Vaktra and the
Aparavaktra metres, while they are absent in the Kathā.2
In this connection Dandin takes quite an independent stand-
point. He of course notices these two formal divisions, but does not
consider them exclusive. The distinctive characteristics, he says,
cannot be fixed, and therefore the Kathā and the Akhyāyikā are

is, all features that go to adorn the kāvya like Guņas, Rasas, are
alamkāras of a kūvya. Bhoja outdoes his predecessor, and includes
all the features of a kāvya as alamkāra for all of them which possess
aucitya add to the beauty of the kāvya. Dr. V. Raghavan in his
treatment of 'Bhoja's Conception of Alamkāra' makes the following
pointed observation; 'His conception of Alamkāra is indeed strange.
We are accustomed in early literature to see guņa considered as
Alarkāra and also Rasas, Vịttis, Lakşaņas and Sandhyaigas. Daņdin
considers all baeutifying features as Alamkāas. Bhoja followed
Dandin and even 'out-Dandinned' Dandin. Most of the topics in
Alamkāra Šāstra are held to be Alamkāras by Bhoja.'12
Alamkāras, according to Bhoja, are of three kinds, Sabdalon-
kāra, Arthālamkāra and Ubhayālamkāra. Of the Sabdalamkara ihe
first two are Jāti and Gati. Jāti is the language used by the poet:
तत्र संस्कृतमित्यादिर्भारती जातिरिष्यते।
सा त्वौचित्यादिभिर्वाचामलंकाराय जायते ॥
Language is the natural medium of expression, but what makes an
alamkāra is the aucitya of language. For,
न म्लेच्छितव्यं यज्ञादौ स्त्रीषु नाप्राकृतं वदेत् ।
संकीर्ण नाभिजातेषु नाप्रबुद्धेषु संस्कृतम् ।।
देवाद्याः संस्कृतं प्राहः प्राकृतं किन्नरादयः ।
पैशाचाद्यं पिशाचाद्या मागधं हीनजातयः ।।''
Moreover, subjects differ and under given circumstances some sub-
ject would require expression in Sanskrit, another in Präkrit and
yet another in Apabhramśa. 15 The one governing consideration
everywhere is that of aucitya. All these variations of the languages
have to be considered by the poet and when the language is used
according to propriety it becomes a śabdālamkāra called Jāti.
Gati is defined as:
पद्यं गद्यं च मिश्रं च काव्यं यत्सा गतिः स्मृता।
__ अर्थोचित्यादिभिः सापि वागलंकार इष्यते ।।"
As Jāti is the medium of expression, Gati is the external form of
expression, prose, verse or a mixture of both. Aucitya in gati makes
it an alamkāra of kävya as prose would be suitable in describing
forests etc., in Kathās and Akhyāyikās, while in Campū mixed style
is suited and so on as the commentator on SKĀ says.
Bhoja says that in a kathū there should be no restriction on
Jāti and Gati, that is, it can be in any language and it can be either
in prose or verse or in a mixed form. This looseness is quite natural
considering that a Kathā is not a dry discourse on any technical

subject. Its aim is only to entertain and thereby convey a moral,
if any.
SMK, therefore, in its formal makeup can be described as a
Kathā in Sanskrit prose having some peculiarities of the Akhyāyikā
form of composition.
Literary Parallels
As a kathā SMK is an important addition to the Sanskrit prose
literature. For the number of prose compositions in Sanskrit litera-
ture, both extant and known by references, is very small.
The plan of the SMK conforms to the traditional method of
story-telling in which, within a frame-tale are emboxed a number
of stories having their own morals to convey. Yet the present work
has its own unique purpose to serve.
The works which most invite comparison with the SMK are
Dāmodaragupta's Kuttanīmata and Kșemendra's samayamātņkā.
All these three works have a similar basic form, though they differ
in structure and treatment of the subjects. The three works start
with the bawd or the procuress giving counsel to the fair courtesan.
In the Kuttanīmata Mālati goes to Vikarālā and in the Samaya-
mātrkā Kalavatſ approaches Jaracchikhā, The three bawds are
described in identical terms as hideous in physical form, cruel in mind
and unscrupulous in their dealings. The instructions follow the same
pattern of thought, that to win over men the courtesan should know
the art of conquering their hearts. 17 Illustrations naturally play
an important part in these works, but while they lie, scattered few
and far between in the other texts, SMK is nothing but a collection
of illustrative stories. Another difference is that the other two
works are in verse while the SMK is in prose. In the matter of
treatment there is a vast difference between this work and the other
two. For even with its above mentioned purpose and some of the
technicalities that it involves, SMK remains an interesting piece
of pure literature. The major interest lies in the narration of the
17. Cf. the introductory words of the three works-
Kuttanīmata, Vs. 23:

tales while the instructions are only pegs on which the stories hang.
But the Kuțțanimata and the Samayamātýkā mainly follow the
technique of the Kāmaśāstra. Their treatment of the subject comes
within the science of erotics, and there is little of literary interest
therein. This remark applies to the SMK as a whole. Coming to
the individual tales it can be said that there is little originality in
them. Many stories about courtesans are found in the Sanskrit,
Jaina and Buddhist works. Their plots and motifs, and the morais
they convey are so limited that with a little change in names and
situation the stories can be multiplied into any number. It is not
possible, therefore, to find original plots in the stories. It is diffi-
cult to point out which is the source of a particular story for there
is also an intermixture of incidents. One remarkable point about
these tales of courtesans is that they offer very little scope for the
free play of fancy. The stories have their origin in the lives of
Gaạikās, and the institution of Gaạikā was a necessary part of the
social structure when these works were written, and therefore the
illustrations are based mainly on actual experiences. This may ex-
plain to a great extent the monotonous similarity of themes in
these plays.
All these tales of courtesans generally reveal three motifs round
which the pattern of the different stories are wrought. The three
motifs are: One, in which the courtesan cheats a rich man and then
throws him out. Second, in which the courtesan is herself punish-
ed, and third, where she is shown as noble in aspiration and true in
love.
Vinayavati (of the first tale) represents the first kind. Deva-
dattā's tale (No. 5) has the same motif though the plot is more
intricate. The Kapatamtyu motif is tactfully utilised and is a com-
mon feature in courtesan tales. It brings to mind Kāmalatā's story
in Kumārapālapratibodha 18 in which Aśoka is caught in the snares
of the courtesan Kāmalatā. But being previously conversant with
the wiles of the gaạikā he does not give away his wealth. Dis-
appointed like Devadattā, she then arranges a Kapatam?tyu. She
mounts a pyre and through an underground passage reaches safely
elsewhere. The news of her death deceives Asoka and when she is
revived by another bawd he prepares to live with her. They stay
together and when his wealth is exhausted he is kicked out. A simi-
lar trick of feigned death is found in Sundarī's story in the Kathā-
saritsāgara. 19 Therein Iśvaravarman leaves Sundarī and goes away.
The clever mother lays a net on the way and follows Iśvaravarman.
After some distance Sundarī jumps into the net and the bawd says
she has tried to put an end to her life due to his having forsaken her.
iśvaravarman believes her word and takes her out. He returns and

33
lives with her, and when all his money has been drained off she
throws him out of the house. Thus Kapatamſtyu always helps the
courtesan to bring the rich paramour back and then destroy him.
Except in the two cases of Vinayavatī and Devadattā the
courtesans are described as being ultimately punished in the SMK.
In Sundari's tale mentioned above there is further development
how īśvaravarman ultimately takes his revenge. It reminds us of
Somadatta taking revenge on Karpūrikā (Seventh tale). We have
seen how Somadatta is successful in not only taking back his she-
pigeon, but also the wealth of the courtesans previously earned,
and how he in exchange gives them a false siddhi and asks the royal
entourage to return after five days. Iśvaravarman takes revenge in
a somewhat similar manner. A monkey is trained to store money
in its mouth and gives out as much as was asked for. Iśvaravarman
shows the monkey to Sundarī and she desires to have it. In bar-
gain all the wealth previously taken away by Sundarī was got back.
īśvaravarman then leaves her. On the third day the monkey stops
giving money, gets angry, and hits Sundarī. The bawd gets angry
and kills it.
Asokavati (tenth story) and Lāvanyasundarſ (eight story) in
SMK have true love for their lovers. Vasantasenā's devotion for the
poor Cārudatta is a classical example of a courtesan's true love,20
The social conditions made it difficult for the courtesan to main-
tain constancy in her love, as in the case of Lāvanyasundari. Against
her own wishes, she had to go to the sovereign king and consequently
suffer indignity at the hands of Ratnadatta. Like Aśokavatī being
freed and married to Chaddalaka, Vasantasenā also was able to escape
the limitations of her way of life and was legally married to Cāru-
datta. Rāgamañjari in Dasakumāracarita21 was won over by merits
by Apahāravarman and against the wishes of her mother and sister
married him as any ordinary girl would do. Aśokavati's instan-
taneous death on hearing of Chaddalaka's death is reminiscent of
the courtesan Vasantasenā's death on hearing of Dhammila's death
in Dhammilacariya in Vasudevahindi.22 In the Kuttanīmata we
have a fine instance of a courtesan's love in Hāralatā's story.23 She
loves Sudarsana but cannot go with him for she understands her
own limitations. She ultimately dies when Sudarśana leaves her.
Besides these courtesan stories there are two exceptional cases
in the SMK., namely, that of Lāvanyasundarī (sixth tale) and Cella-
mahādevī (thirteenth tale). The former was the wife of an oilmen
who took to the life of a courtesan to free her husband from the

clutches of a king. The later was a queen who loved a low-born
elephant-driver and was punished in the end.
The motifs of both these stories seem to be popular for we have
parallel versions. In the Kathāsaritsāgara24 we have the story
of the courtesan Kumudikā, a friend of king Vikramasimha. She
helped him in times of distress, but the king's minister Anangatunga
warned the king against her. In order to test her the king feigned
death and was carried to the burning ghat. Fearlessly Kumudikā
ascended the funeral pyre after him. The king was now convinced
of her loyalty and returned. Anangatunga still would not trust her,
Once with her wealth the king conquered his enemies. He was
much pleased and asked her to choose a boon. Then she told him
that her true lover was a captive of the king of Ujjayinī and that
Vikrama should wage war on that king and free her lover. The
king was shocked and surprised, but fulfilled her wish and united
them.
The same story is reproduced in the Kalāvilāsa of Kşemen-
dra.25 The only difference is that her lover is described as a captive
in Vidarbha. The changes in the version of the SMK make the
story more realistic and better motivated. Lāvanyasundari is the
wife of an oilman and her attachment to her husband is only natural.
She resorts to the powerful king Vikrama to win him over and
thereby gain a gift of one hundred elephants to bring about the
release of her husband. It does not sound probable that a king
wars with another merely for the sake of an ordinary individual.
Another change is that after undergoing a number of tests to prove
her loyalty Lāvanyasundari finally kills herself only to be received
by the grace of the Goddess Āsāpurā. Of course, the supernatural
element of Divine grace has to be introduced, but it is a common
motif, and it looks more plausible than that of the king himself posing
as dead and going right up to the burning ghat.
Lastly we come to the story of the unfaithful queen. 'Adultery'
is the motif of the story. In the Kathāsaritsāgara we read of the
love of the married woman for a low-born ugly wretch.217 The
Dasakumāracarita27 also has such an episode. A similar story is
found in the life of Yaśodhara as described in Somadeva's Yaśasti-
lakacampū.28 It runs as follows: One night when the king Yaśo-
dhara was in the apartments of queen Amrtagati he saw her go
out secretly to his crippled and ugly elephant-driver. The king
followed her. He saw the elephant-driver getting angry at her
delay and beating her in anger. The king was surprised, disillusioned
and sorrowful. In the end, however, unlike our kathānikā, the
king is killed by the queen. The closest parallel to Mūladeva's

story is the one given in Hemachandra's Pariſistaparvan.29 The motif
in both the stories is the same, that the hero overlooks the unfaith-
fulness of his wife (in one case) and his daughter-in-law (in another)
on seeing that even ladies of noble birth, like the queens, were deeply
degraded by their sensuality.30
Devadattā finding out the truth about the queen's nocturnal
adventures, his informing the king, the marks of the chains on the
queen's body and the king's punishment all closely resemble Mūla-
deva's story.31 We have in the former part of Devadattā's story
the narration of the daughter-in-law's bad conduct. Is it possi-
ble that the lost part of the story of Mūladeva's wife might have
been similar to it in certain respects?
The analogous stories referred to here are not exhaustive; for
the purpose in referring to them is only to show the similarity be-
tween the tales in SMK with those in other works. And yet, as has
already been noted, the SMK has its own distinctiveness. The
absence of originality in the plots or motifs does not lessen the lite-
rary merit of the work. The poet's merit lies in the way he narrates
and develops the story, and in his style, characterisation, descriptions
and other niceties of language which are the standards of critical
appreciation.
Style and Diction
SMK belongs to the decadent period of Sanskrit literature
when the creative genius of the poet was cramped by the rigidities
of forms and conventions, and the poet imitated the creations of his
predecessors. The works of this period therefore naturally came
to be overladen with the artificialities of formal descriptions, poetic
excellences and technicalities, exhibiting more the erudition of the
poet than his creativeness. The SMK follows the same pattern and
resembles in style the earlier prose romances like the Kadambarī,
and the comtemporaneous ones like the Tilakamañjarī. But on the
whole the composition does not become artificial. The style which
is simple in narration is embellished with various kinds of alamkāras
in the descriptive passages.
The most frequent figure of speech is the paranomastic simile
(śliştopamā). The puns are interesting, and though novel, are not

obscure. For example in the description of the bawd we read:
___ ग्रहपतिरिव बहुशो भुक्तमीनमेषा . . . . . . सिकतासन्ततिरिवस्नेहोज्झिता . . . .
चाणक्यनीतिरिव यो येनोपायेन ग्राह्यस्तं तेन गृहूणन्ती। (p. १५)
Another good example of it is:
सुरभि श्वसिते, शुचिमाचारे, घनागममशेषविजयसम्पदाम्, अत्यूर्ज परावजयेषु, परमहिम-
स्थानमाकृतौ, शिशिरं निखिलक्षान्तिषु। (p. ३७)
There are instances of 'Sabhanga śleşas' like:
कुरूपयुक्तापि न कृपान्विता। (p. १८)32
The next figure of speech frequently used is Virodha which is indi.
cated by 'api.' and sometimes based on slesa as:
द्विजिह्वशतसंश्रयमपि स्निग्धसरलम्, अतिगुरुमप्यगुरुप्रायम् (पर्वतम् ) (p. ७९)
Similes are very common. An interesting simile compares this com-
position, the SMK, to the heroine called Srigāramanjari: शृङगारमञ्जरी
गद्यप्रवृत्तिरिव सुललितपदा (p. १३). Another interesting and important
simile is the comparison of a mountain with the author of the work,
Bhoja, himself: एतत्कथाकारमिव विराजितपरमारावनीपवंशम्। (p. ७९). In the
description of the king there is an astronomical simile which
compares the King to the different planets. Unfortunately the text
is not complete here. There are a few grammatical and metrical
similes like:
व्याकरण प्रक्रियेवोपसर्गवशात् परस्मैपदोत्पादनकुशला। (p. १५)
छन्दःस्थितिरिवोज्ज्वलतनुमध्या। (p. १३)
A good example of rūpaka is:

The imagery in the following Utprekşā is novel and charming:

मुकुलितकुमुदकोशकोटरान्तनिलीनमधुकरतया दिवसकरभयात् प्रतनुतां गतेनान्धकारेणेव ॥
संश्रितानि (सरांसि) (p. ४) ।
The figure of speech called Svabhāvokti is abundantly used. For
example: निजचापलभ्रमणखेदविधुरेष्ववनिरुहस्कन्धशाखान्तरनिलयननिभृतेषु यथायथमुपवि-

The Svabhāvokti sometimes blossoms into a lovely word-picture
which impresses with its vividness and richness of details. A few
examples are given below. One is of an old monkey left alone on a
tree when the whole forest is burning due to the heat of the summer:

मितस्ततः समारोहतकाकिना जरन्मर्कटेनारुह्यमाणजीर्णोत्तुङगतरुशिखराम्। (p. ५०)
Another is of a group of elephants passing urine. The description
is natural and vivid: अपरैश्च पीत्वा पयस्तट एव किञ्चिदघोनमितजघनभागैरुत्फुल्ल-
कुक्षिभिः स्तोकोत्तम्भितश्रवणपल्लवैरवनितलस्रस्तहस्तैरीषद्विधृतकन्धरैः श्रवणाभिमुखत्र्यश्रितै-
कनेत्रविभागैः सावधानमाणितमूत्रधाराध्वनिभिर्मूत्रीयमाणैः (करिकुलैः)। (p. ५१)
There is another picture-a picture of a woman in the yantra-dhārā-
grha who has just come out of water and from whose hair water is
dripping down: क्वचिन्मज्जनोत्तीर्णस्वर्णपूत्रिकानिश्चोत्यमानकबरीवालकलापप्रान्तेभ्यः।(p. ६)
It is a complete picture in a few choice words.
Descriptions of seasons, towns, etc. are considered a necessary
feature in Sanskrit literary compositions. In the Epics, and the
great works like those of Kālidāsa and Băna we come across such
descriptions. Bhoja has followed the conventions and as he himself
says in the beginning कथा हि कीर्त्यमाना नगरादिवर्णनपुरःसराः सौन्दर्यमावहति(p. १)
This work is full of descriptions of towns, gardens, lakes, seasons and
the like.
The descriptions of the town and its essential features such as
the lakes, fountain houses and the like shed considerable light on
the town-planning of those days, and have therefore been discussed
in the sixth chapter.
The descriptions of Nature in all its aspects are vivid and pic-
turesque. The exactness with which the author has observed the
changes in the seasons, the vividness with which he has described
the glory of the day and the night, the noon and the eventide, the
sunset and the moonrise, and the keen eye with which he has observ-
ed the blooming and decaying of the flora* speak of his intimacy
with Nature. From the various descriptions of nature we read in
Sanskrit literature we can infer that nature exercised great influence
on man's life in those days. It is because of this close relationship
between man and nature that nature was regarded even by the
writers on poetics as one of the Uddipana-vibhāvas, excitant deter-

minants, in producing and enhancing the effects of sentiment or rasa.
Bhoja himself says in the SKA:
ऋतुरात्रि दिवाकेन्दूदयास्तमयकीर्तनः।
काल: काव्येषु संपन्नो रसपुष्टिं नियच्छति ।।
Thus besides admiring with the poet's eye the beauties of Nature the
poet also acknowledges its effects on the emotions and affections of
men. Another thing to be noted is man's realization of the utility
of nature's munificent gifts. The trees with their leaves and the
flowers with the component parts like the petals, juice, pollen etc.
are described as being put to daily use by the people. Thus the
poet's charming descriptions of nature, though cast generally in the
conventional mould not only enhance the poetical merit of the com-
position, but bring home to our mind that they are the spontaneous
expressions of feelings of the poet on coming in contact with nature.
It is shocking to read, therefore, F. Hall's criticism in his preface to
the Väsavadattā34 wherein he writes with affrontery and in utter
lack of understanding that 'Natural scenery, though boundless in
variety, is to the Hindu, an object of impassive incuriosity and un-
concern: and low indeed must be that type of humanity to which
this imputation can fairly be brought home'.
In the Kādambarī we have a short description of the Vindhya
forest running into twenty-eight lines. In the SMK we have a longer
description of the same forest which runs into about a hundred and
eight lines. Like Bāna, this author also describes the forest as
extending from the eastern to the western ocean. The wild beasts
and the trees mentioned in the two texts are practically the same.
Two other long-drawn descriptions in the SMK are those of a
horse and an elephant. Every part of the body is described, and
unusual words like the āvarta meaning a lock of hair that curls back-
wards and which is considered lucky especially on a horse; and
arakṣa the junction of the frontal sinuses of an elephant, lead us to
infer that the author had a detailed knowledge of the Gajaśāstra and
the Aśvavidyā. Bhoja's love for animals is patent, and in this con-
text it may not be out of place to mention that among the books
ascribed to him there is one called śālihotra which treats of the care
of horses and their diseases. 35
There is great similarity between the description of the city of
Dhārā with that of Ayodhyā given in the Tilakamaſjarikathā of
Bhoja's contemporary Dhanapāla.

Diction
In the SMK, while describing the heroine the author says:
TESTCH5UTIFafafta HFESTTATI (p. 83)
It describes his choice of words as being elegant. And indeed, unlike
the other prose Kävyas, which abound in harsh and jingling words,
the choice of words in the SMK is simple and carries verbal assonance.
Conscious effort has been made at some places for alliteration. For
example: estafete fogauguinisafrtarugICOSTITUS FUEGETA FUESTA (p.
40) and even in short sentences like: 7 37959 99,370 GAT TITTY
गल्भा प्रश्नोत्तरप्रहेलिकादिप्रभेदेषु. . . . . लब्धलक्ष्या लास्ये, अक्षमा समस्यासु, प्रबुद्धा प्रबन्ध-
fortial (p. ??)
Free use is made of compounds but they are not difficult of compre-
hension. Diction is varied; but it is not obscure. Synonymous and
paranomastic words are often met with; rare words like samaja and
pattanikā;; philosophical terms like smrti-pramoșa and avidyā; and
technical terms like bhāțī and grahaņaka are freely used. The
influence of contemporary diction on the language is obvious. Thus
we have instances of Prākrit words like Kadavakka and Deśya words
like akkā and avvā in the text. Sometimes the base of a Prakrit or
Deśya word is used to coin a Sanskrit word. For example we have
the words thaka and thakayitva, the base of which is the Deśya word
‘thaga'; or again the word ţirițillitāni of which the base is the Prak-
rit word țirițilla. These words have been explained in the Notes.
Occasionally we come across general observations which can
pass as sayings, like:
गार्हस्थ्यं हि निखिलाश्रमजीवभूतम् ।
In a work like this where the action of the tale is obstructed by
lengthy descriptions there is hardly any scope for conversations.
Yet at a few places we have instances of conversations which are
forceful and direct. Thus the first conversation between the king
and his friends is interesting. The one between Lavangikā and
Priyangikā (in the fourth tale) is the natural, while that between
Lāvanyasundarī and Vikrama (sixth tale) is short but tense.
Characterization
The delineation of characters in the SMK follows the purpose
of the text, and therefore the characters represent types' rather than
individuals. A large number of characters have been depicted in-
cluding kings, princes, courtiers, merchants and Brāhmaṇas. But
the interest lies not in the variety of their different stations in life
but in the workings of their minds. The author shows a thorough
understanding of the human mind—its innermost workings—which
make up the personality of the man and makes him react differently
30. See Appendix II.

to different situations. The author also explains through his
characters how the sudden changes in the attitudes and behaviours
of men are due to the subtle influences of attachments, prejudices
and the like. Thus in the very beginning it is said: ua fe sfa-

कश्चिद्भीरुरपि शौर्यं प्रकटयति। लुब्धोऽप्युदात्तायते। उदात्तोऽपि कदर्यवद् व्यवहरति ।

gaHa Neut fanf(HTT02 41 41 fa4f+4 14T THỰt Tic Te etc. (p. ?<).
Ravidatta (of the first tale) is a wealthy and educated young
man, inexperienced in the ways of life. He fights shy of himself
when he feels the first attractions of love. But once he gathers
courage and goes to the courtesan, all his reserve and shyness dis-
appears, he loses control of himself and does not know where to
stop. The courtesan's insults do not awaken him to his senses and
he ends his life as a mad man.
Vikramasimha is a prince, rich, charitable, bold, noble and plea-
sure-loving. He dares ask Mālatikā to invite him even when she
was at the house of Vasudatta. He has patience too to wait for her
till she is free. When he is immensely pleased with her, he be-
stows gifts upon her, but when due to some reason he is offended
he stops giving her presents and going to her place.
Madhava is even more high-strung. When the bawd and the
courtesan try to keep him back against his wishes he goes to the
extreme of cutting off the bawd's nose and ears, and feels satisfied
after doing that. Vinayadhara punishes the bawd in a similar
manner; but while Mādhava does it in an outburst of righteous anger,
Vinayadhara is a shameless person who plays a roguish trick to gain
his own end. Suradharman (of the fourth tale) is a real dhūrta. To
conceal his treasure he acts like a mad man and the clever Devadatta
has to go to the extent of feigning death to deceive him. But when
Suradharman is ultimately robbed off his jewel and thrown out of
the house, he has no grievances and goes on his way.
Somadatta (of the seventh tale) is intelligent and calculative. In-
fatuated by Karpūrikā's charms he gives out the secret of the pigeon,
but being once deceived he is stung to the quick and takes proper
revenge. Pratāpasimha (eleventh tale) is beastly. Ugly and senuous
he is roused to anger quickly at Malayasundari's teasing him. He
pounces upon her like a tiger and injures her. He openly acknow-
ledges the outrage and is glad when the king punishes the courtesan.
King Vikrama features in three stories (5th, 6th and 13th). He
is noble, straightforward and sincere. He believes Davadatta's
fantastic experience (fifth tale), and is pleased with her. When he




Page 64****************************************************************************************
À CRITICAL APPRECIATION OF THE SMK
comes to know that it was a fabricated tale narrated to please him
he appreciates her ingenuity and is doubly gratified. With Lāvanya-
sundarī he is true and considerate. He makes sincere efforts to
test her love. When Lāvanyasundarī dies he prepares to put an
end to his own life too. He offers his all to her but when in the
end, the truth is revealed, he generously offers to held Lāvanya-
sundari. In the last story about Mūladeva also, Vikrama is deceived
by his own queen. When Müladeva impresses upon him the fact
that the latter was wrong in holding that women were not fickle, he
accepts it and justly punishes his queen.
Chaddalaka is a sincere and true lover. He understands that
the king has made efforts to separate Asokavati from him. He
is anxious to test her not because he doubts her but because he
wishes to prove her fidelity to the king. When unfortunately
Asokavati dies, he cries like a child and puts an end to his life as
well. Sundaraka is a conscientious youth who undertakes the
unpleasant task of coming between the two lovers only to please
the king. When Aśokavatî repents of her mistake, Sundaraka is
sorry about it; and when he hears of her death, he feels so guilty
that he puts an end to his own life.
The best delineated character is that of Ratnadatta. A Vaisya
by birth, he hates to join his father's business knowing that it is
censurable. He wishes to join the services of the sovereign king.
When another king offers him half his kingdom, he refuses. He
is a gallant but he had decided not to be enslaved in the snares of
any courtesan. He understands Lāvanyasundarī's love for him, but
leaves her to pursue his own desires. He goes to serve the sovereign,
but is bold enough to ask him not to interfere in his personal mat-
ters. He is an avadhānin being able to perform many acts simul-
taneously without forgetting any one of them. He is well-versed
in many subjects and can put them to good use unlike Ravidatta.
He is an example of a proud and ambitious youth who is indifferent
to the human frailties like love and attachment.
The women characters are not so interesting. They represent
'types' more than the male characters. Their stations in life do
not give much scope for developing their personalities and their
actions are always prompted by motives. Therefore there is not
much difference between one ganikā and the other. But the courte-
sans may generally be divided into two classes; ganikās adept in the
profession of harlotry and sticking fast to their conventions, and
those remaining constant in their love,
Besides these main characters there are other important female
characters like the mothers' of the courtesans. Their very names
like Vişamaśīlā, Bhujangavāgurā. Makaradańştrā and Ekadarştrā are

sufficient to show them in bad light. In literature we have pictures-
que descriptions of beautiful heroines, but a description such as that
of Vişamasilā is rarely to be found. It may be an ugly picture, but,
all the same, it is realistic and vivid. She may be taken as a
typical ‘mother' or procuress.
. In physical form she is hideous, old, hunchbacked and worn
out. She is besides cunning, cruel, greedy and deceitful. She is
indeed an eye-sore to the young men who come to her house. But
she is an important person in the courtesan's house. Śộngāramañjarī
is instructed by Vişamaśīlā; Lāvaṇyasundarſ goes to the bawd
Dhondhā for counsel; Davadattā's mother makes Suradharman give
up the precious jewel; and Karpūrikā's mother makes Somadatta
reveal the secret of the pigeon and the pigeon as well. For their
cruelty, the 'mothers' are sometimes justly punished. Vinayadhara
punishes Anangavati's mother and Madhava, Kuvalayāvali's mother.
Bhoja's skill in characterization is indeed displayed in the de-
lineation of these bawds, for though they are minor characters, their
portrayal is complete.
Sentiments
The theme of the book is the courtesan's love, and therefore
the sentiment of śrngāra overshadows other sentiments. But there
are sentiments like humour and pathos which help in diversifying
and thereby developing the main erotic sentiment.
Häsya or humour is supplied by the instances in which the
bawd or the courtesan is cheated. Thus in the 'tale of the Serpent
Vinayadhara brings a dead serpent, places it on the body of the
bawd and pinches her nose and lips. When the bawd cries aloud,
he comes and pretending to kill the serpent, cuts off her nose and
lips quickly before the truth could be found out. In one sentence
the whole action is beautifully described: ततो दासीभिर्झगिति प्रबोधिते
दीपे सर्पमवलोक्य च्छेदं प्रयच्छामीति तेनाभिहिते 'प्रयच्छ प्रयच्छ' इत्युक्ते 'क्व प्रयच्छामि'
SET 37717' goufafaahtisfa Hezi Afhai faca I (p. 66).
The irony is that Vinayadhara is thanked for saving the life of the
'mother' and felicitations are offered while the bawd suffers in pain
all her life.
In another instance, Somadatta takes revenge on Karpūrikā.
He brings along with him his royal brother's wealth and men to
serve his purpose, and tells her a fib that it is due to a siddhi he
obtained at the “riparvata. In exchange for a pigeon and all the
wealth previously earned by the courtesan he most solemnly gives
her the siddhi he had obtained by saying: येयं मया श्रीपर्वते सिद्धिरामादिता
177 f ia HTCTT: 91TTII (p. 44).

Another instance is the way in which Mādhava punishes the
'mother' of Kuvalayāvalī. Even after draining him completely of
his wealth and receiving his rich upper garment as a last gift
they are not satisfied. They follow him and request him to hand
over the last lower garment and thus denude himself. Mādhava is
then really irritated. He says he would hand it over after leaving
the main road; then at a quiet place calling the bawd he throws her
down and forcibly cuts off her ears and nose and says this token of
remembrance will never be forgotten by them.
These instances provide humour which is obviously gross and
almost of a farcical character, but is sometimes rendered grim by the
nature of circumstances.
The pathetic element is found in the different stories dealing
with the suffering of persons due to separation or death. For in-
stance, Lāvaṇyasundarī falls in love with Ratnadatta at the first
sight. She follows him faithfully upto Mānyakheța. She experi-
ences the pain of separation when Ratnadatta leaves her for three
days at the house of Cittralekhā. To add insult to injury the king
invites her to his place and per force she has to go. And on the
fourth day, the day of the return of Ratnadatta, when the king
calls her to dance, she goes against her wishes. On hearing of the
return of Ratnadatta she runs home, but is disappointed. Ratna-
datta is cold in attitude and taunts her and does not accept the ser-
vices she desires to offer. It is indeed pathetic to read: "1999-
सुन्दरि पादौ मा प्राक्षीः । त्वं हि मम जननी भवसि”। सा तु साकूतमवादीत्-"रत्नदत्त किमेतत् ?"
रत्नदत्तस्तां पुनरवादीत् - "किमन्यत् ? त्वं हि मत्प्रभोहराः, तद्भवतु, पूर्यते, उपविश्यताम् ।"
(p. 84).
Still more pathetic is Asokavati's repentance after having given
way to her fancy and spent a night with Sundaraka in amorous plea-
sures. She cries out: foi izazn......9791 91937 fafany I 377
दुल्लुंध्या हतविधेविलसितानां गतिरनतिक्रमणीयान्यवश्यंभाव्यान्यप्रतिविधेया नियतिर्यन्मदीय..
त्यनुरागस्यैवंविधा परिणतिः, तन्नियतमनुल्लंध्या भवितव्यता। तयाऽर्थलुब्धया पापकारिण्या नास्मि
afarafat (p. 90). Her repentance was so sincere that Sundaraka
was sorry for what he had done. And when Aśokavati died on hear-
ing the false news about Chaddalaka's death Sundaraka felt he was
responsible for it and put an end to his own life.
The sentiment of Wonder or Adbhuta rasa is best developed in
the fifth tale of Devadattā. In order to please the king Devadattā
narrates a wonderful experience of hers, of course imaginary, which
the king however takes to be real. She says she was passing through
the parade ground when she saw a handsome youth on a fine horse.
He beckoned to her and she sat on the horse with him. The horse

flew up in the sky and took them far away to an unknown destina-
tion. A beautiful woman waiting there, a man with a whip, their
request to Devadattā, her crying out to Vikrama and her falling
back to earth, all these provide elements of wonder. Similarly in
the last tale of Mūladeva we have a reference to some sort of magic
by which a beautiful woman was created by a mahāvratika and he
enjoyed her company. Then the woman threw up from her heart
a man of the size of a thumb. Water from a gourd was sprinkled
on him and he became a handsome young man and she enjoyed his
company. When it was time for the mahāvratika to come she made
the youth small and swallowed him. On his return, the mahāvratiku
also made her small and devoured her.
Unfortunately the text before and after this description is lost
and therefore the context cannot be properly understood, but what
is given is sufficient to excite wonder.
The manifestations of the Goddess Aśāpurā to King Vikrama
and King Samarasimha and their talk with her and the reviving of
the dead due to Her blessings are also instances of wonder. Another
common motif that produces wonder is the 'pigeon motif' (seventh
tale).
Allusions to other Authors and Works
Bhoja alludes to the Vedas, the epics, the Šāstras and the Dar-
śanas. He mentions the study of Śști, Khila, Nigama, Purāņa,
Itihāsa, Smrti (p. 3), Vyākaraṇa (p. 84, OC), Chandas (p. 83)
Views of the Smộtis are referred to on two points, namely, that the
killing of a woman is a sin (p.38) and that wife is considered the
half of man (p. 68).
The Bhārata is mentioned once by name and the Rāmāyaṇa
twice (pp. 83, 10). But the personages and incidents of the two
epics often alluded to are quite a few. Arjuna (p. Ri, Subhadrā
(p. P), Draupadi (p. 83), Nakula (p. 83) and Krpa (p. 86) are men-
tioned because of the paranomastic nature of the words. The
crushing of the demon Pralamba by Balarāma (p. c) and the game
of dice between the Pandavas and the Kauravas (p. 83) are also
referred to. The destruction of the Kşatriyas and the revealing
of the Dhanurveda by Bhārgava (p. C) is mentioned. Together
with Vyāsa as a poet-sage, Vālmīki and Parāśara (p. 8) have been
named. The ten-headed Rāvana and Vibhīşaņa (p. 3) are also men-
tioned. Rāvana obstructing the path of the moon and the Vindhya
obstructing the path of the sun are mentioned. The battle between
Rāma and Rāvana is referred to (p. 66). The names of Lakşmaņa
(p. 3), Sugrīva (pp. 8,83), Nila and Nala (p. 60), Virocana (p. 88)
Prahasta and Subāhu (p. 83) are mentioned as they offer scope for
puns.

The Purāņas are described as giving instructions through
Kathās, Akhyānakas, Kadavakas,37 Manikūlyās. 38 Drstặntas, and
Nidarśanas39 (p. 17). Among the avatāras Vāmana (p. 15), Bhār-
gava (p. 8) and Narasimha (p. 17) are taken as standards of com-
parison. The story of Urvasi and Purūravas (p. 20), the tale of
Hariscandra (p. 13) and the churning of the ocean (p. 13) are referred
to by way of comparison.
Authorities in the field of Arthaśāstra
There is a rather interesting reference in the book to some of
the well-known ancient authorities on policy. The sentence, corrupt
in readings, has been reconstructed thus: Hey Fifa 07147TTI
विपश्चितां गिरि न गरिमाणमारोहति गुरुः, न प्रति (भासते प्रतिभा) वान् भार्गवो, नोद्ध
वमतिवर्द्धयत्युद्धवः, अ (यते) न प्राज्ञगणनां चाणक्यः,न कुशाग्रीयबुद्धितामधिश्रयति धर्मकीर्तिः ।
(p. 9). Here Guru, Bhārgava, Uddhava, Cāņakya and Dharmakirti are
mentioned in the same strain. Cāņakya is Kautilya, the celebrated
author of the Arthaśāstra. At one place in the text he is called
Kautilya of the wicked intellect: कुटिलमतिकौटिल्यप्रभृतीन् बटूनिवापटून्
TOFATI (p. 17) and at another place in the text his policy of
administration is beautifully described as: चाणक्यनीतिरिव यो येनोपायेन
Teuta F i (p. 15). He is one among the wise.
Guru is Bphaspati, who is referred to by Kautilya as a teacher in
the Arthaśāstra. The Mahābhārata, the Kamasūtra, the Kāmandakiya
and many other works quote Bșhaspati as an authority on policy.40
The next reference is to Bhārgava. We may take Bhārgava as refer-
ring to Ušanas who is a son of Bhrgu. The Arthaśāstra quotes the
Auśanasas many times. The Mahābhārata, Viśvarūpa (on Yājñaval-
kyasmộti I-307) and other works quote Uśanas's views on polity and
it is held that Uśanas had written a work on politics.41 In the
śāntiparva we have a nitiśāstra ascribed to Bhārgava. Kane, giving
a list of the authorities quoted by Kātyāyana in Karmapradīpa,
mentions one Bhārgava who, he thinks, is probably Ušanas.42
Further, in Abdhutasāgara of Ballālasena, there are a number of
authorities given of which one is Bhārgavīya.43 This may be the
work of Bhārgava or Uśanas. At another place in the present text
Uśanas is mentioned as being an authority in Upanişads. It is pro-
bable that this reference is to Uśanas, the authority of polity. Like
the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya where the 14th book is called Aupani-
șadikam, and which describes ways and means to obtain desired
objects by mystic formulæ and the like, the work of Uśanas might
have had a chapter on this subject and this reference might be to
it. The reference is after a reference to Ka'utilya, and the whole

context deals with clever and deceitful actions and therefore Upani-
şad cannot be taken as referring to the Vedānta books.
The next name is of Uddhava. In the siśupālavadha where
Krşņa takes advice from his sage-like uncle Uddhava on a matter of
political importance, the poet calls him Pavanavyādhi.44 In the
Arthaśāstra we read of the opinions of Vātavyădhi who is identified
with Pavanavyādhi, who is none other than Uddhava. Nayacan-
drikā, a commentary on Arthaśāstra, confirms the identification of
Vātavyādhi with Uddhava.45
These are all great intellectuals and therefore Dharmakirti, the
Buddhist logician, is bracketed along with them.
Schools of Philosophy
There are stray philosophical reflections in the SMK like
Fazafafra TTATRITTSTPUT 1 (p. 16) and Arua AtarfegittifaTTT: 1 (p. 18).
But it refers to most of the schools of philosophic thought by the
names of their founders together with their principal postulates.
The difference between the two trends of Mimāṁsā thought is re-
ferred to as the ‘Prabhākaraprajñā' (the wisdom of Prabhākara) and
the 'Kumārilamati' (the view or creed of Kumārila); the school of
Vaišeşikas is called the 'Kaņādamati' (the School of Kanāda); the
Nyāya system as 'Akşapādavidyā' (the knowledge of Akşapāda) and
the teachings of Buddha as 'Śākyaśāsana' (the teachings of Bud-
dha).46 Besides these the systems of the Pāñcarātra47 and the
Lokāyatas48 are referred to. At one place a character is described
as being dressed like a mendicant of the Pāśupata sect who refers
to himself as 'Hīnasatva' (p. 71), from which we may infer the
existence of the followers of the Pāśupata sect.
Masters of Literature
In the beginning of the SMK we have references to some of the
literati of Sanskrit. The names of the masters of prose are strung
together in the following sentence which is paranomastic in
character:
atstoffe TOTT qara: HTET TITTI: TTFTTafor: 1 (p. 1).
The references to Subandhu and Bāņa are obvious, for their works
are outstanding in Sanskrit prose literature. The reference to

Guņādhya is interesting. Only three verses of his Byhatkathā are
known, but the contents have been fairly preserved in the Brhat-
kathā-slokasamgraha of Budhasvāmin, the Bșhatkathāmañjarī of
Kşemendra and the Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva. These three
works are in verse, and from them it can be inferred that the
Bșhatkathā must have been in verse. But Daņņin's Kāvyādarsa
refers to Brhatkathā as prose romance.49 This reference to
Guņādhya among the prose writers in this romance confirms Dandin's
statement, which implies and supports the view of scholars that the
Brhatkathā was in prose.so
The inclusion of Bhāsa among the prose writers is as interesting
as it is important. The question which it raises is whether Bhāsa
wrote any prose work at all. Now, if Bhoja had in mind the
dramas attributed to Bhāsa, this reference could only be to the prose
passages in them. But it would be rather unnatural to include a
dramatist among prose writers. Moreover, the issue is complicated
by another subsequent reference where Bhāsa is mentioned among
those poets who have indulged in autobiographical, if not self-adula-
tory writing. As is well-known, however, the dramas are totally
silent about their author. Therefore there are two possible expla-
nations; either (1) the dramas are recasts of original Bhāsa plays in
which the Prastāvanā might have contained personal information
regarding the author or (2) SMK had some other prose (?) work of
Bhāsa in mind. It is likely that Bhāsa may have written in prose.
Bhavabhūti has been mentioned as a poet who has written about
himself.
Kāmaśāstra and the Alaikāraśāstra
As regards the present work special reference should be made
to Bhoja's indebtedness to the sciences of Erotics and Poetics. For
the theme of the courtesan's love offers a chance to the author to
analyse the heroes, the heroines, their attachments and states of
love, and the different characters that figured in their lives as accom-
plices or adversaries. These topics form the stock-in-trade of both
these sciences and hence the author draws upon them.
Speaking of the Kāmaśāstra first, Bhoja has mentioned only one
authority in the field. That is Dattaka. The reference is as
follows: faqat faalfaguitar for ETT Stroa: 1 (p. 19). In
Vātsyāyana's Kāmasūtra we read that śvetaketu's treatise on this
subject was condensed to seven chapters by Pāñcālabābhravya.51

SRNGARAMAÑJARIKATHA
At the request of the hetarai of Pāțaliputra, Dattaka undertook to
write about courtesans and their lives, dealt with in the sixth chapter
of the above mentioned treatise.52 Vātsyāyana himself refers to the
‘Dattaka-śāsana' in the sixth chapter of his work.53 The reference
in SMK indicates that the works of Dattaka and others must have
been current during Bhoja's times. As this work deals with the
life of courtesans the reference to Dattaka becomes particularly
significant.
In the Caturbhāṇī, it is surprising that in the two Bhāņas of
Śūdraka (Padmaprābhṛtaka) and īśvardatta (Dhūrtavițasanvāda)
Dattaka54 and his sūtras are referred to while Vătsyāyana is not
mentioned at all.
In the Kuţtanīmata of Damodaragupta the courtesan is described
as adept in the science of erotics and considering authorities like
Vätsyāyana, Dattaka and Rājaputra as ignorant in the matter.55
Bhoja has not mentioned Vātsyāyana by name but the heroine
is described as an adept in the Kāmasūtra and the like works
(faqeu Fir Haarfafaatio p. 12). According to Vātsyāyana the Gaņikā's
respectable status in society is due to her mastery in the sixty-four
Vidyās;56 the sixty-four Sāmprayogika Vidyās are also mentioned
by him.57 The heroine here is described as having mastery over both
these kinds of sixty-four Vidyās (ueethaec:TfCFA p. 12). The pic-
ture of the Nāgaraka given in the KS58 is brought out in the stories
of the SMK. Besides these the familiarity of the SMK with the KS
is very clear.
No authority in Alamkāraśāstra has been mentioned by name
in the SMK. But a line from Daņqin's Kāvyādarśa (Fanufaf16147
HTT HETTeaTf11: p. 10) has been quoted. Bhoja is deeply indebted
to Daņdin whom he follows in many respects. It has been men-
tioned before how Bhoja's conception of Alumkāra is only an
elaboration of Daņņin's view.59 The same is the case with regard
to his unique theory of śụngāra for which he quotes Dandin's autho-
rity; this will be dealt with in the next chapter. We have also seen

above how in introducing the peculiarities of the Ākhyāyikā form
of composition into this Kathā, Bhoja has followed Dandin's view
that it is not possible to stick to rigidity of forms in such composi-
tions.
The theory of Rāga which serves one of the important purpose
of the text and which will be discussed in the next chapter, come
within the scope of both poetics and erotics.
Besides the main characters, who have been described above
in general terms, we find references to many other types of persons
who have been described in the works on poetics and erotics.
There are stray references to some of the eight avasthā-näyikās.
Of them one is the Abhisārikā. She is described in the SKA.60 as:
पुष्पेषुपीडिता कान्तं याति या साभिसारिका ।
In the SMK also she is described as going to her lover. Therefrom
we understand that Bhoja derives the word only from abhisarand
(going to) and not abhisāraņa (making him come) as Dhanikai
and others take it. Bhoja describes in words three kinds of Abhisā-
rikās. One going out in the moonlight (p. 44), another in the dark-
ness of the night (p. 74) and the third going out at mid-day (p. 85).
It is due to such distinctions made by poets that later rhetoricians
have classified Abhisārikā and designated them as Jyotsnābhisarika,
Tamasvinyabhisārikā and Divābhırsarikā.62
The Vásakasajjās are described as decorating their houses and
looking again and again at the path of their lovers. At another
place they are described as waiting in the Candraśālās with the walls
decorated with garlands of vicikila flowers and the smoke of the
incense darkening the ceilings.
The Proșitabhartrkā is described in the SKA as: fent catre
OFEST: FT T SifcoTI (V, 19). In such a condition the nāyikā
becomes impatient in spring. Her desire for union is not satisfied;
therefore she cannot enjoy the beauty of Spring, nor can she tolerate
the joy of others. With this condition of hers in mind Bhoja beauti-

fully describes her as impatiently complaining at the advent of
Spring. 'Ah, what is this new kind of Madhu (Spring, Wine) that
even without smelling or tasting it, the minds of all the people be-
come so intoxicated'.
Besides these, Virahiņā—the separated and the Mānini--
the proud—are mentioned. The Virahiņā is heart-broken in Spring,
she becomes pale and her only ornaments are the lotuses. The
Mānini loses her reserve in the moonlight and on rainy days. In
Spring her pride is completely humbled by the sports of love.
Among the female aides mentioned are Vayasyā, Sakhi, Anucari,
Prativesinī and Dūti. Vayasyā is the same as Sakhi and Anucarī
She is a close friend of the Nāyikā and sometimes works as her Dūtī
also. Bakulikā (in the sixth tale) is a loyal and sympathetic friend
of Lāvanyasundarī. She protects Lāvanyasundarī by dancing in her
turn and herself goes in search of Ratnadatta twice. Sangamikā
(first tale) goes to Ravidatta, speaks about Vinayavati's love and
brings him to her.
The Prativesinī is the neighbour, but she is also considered as
an accomplice and used as a messenger by either the hero or the
heroine.63 In SMK Nāyaka Somadatta (seventh tale) stays at the
house of Karpūrikā's Prativesinī. She is once again mentioned as
Prātivesinī (p. 83).
The Dūtī is the messenger. She is an expert at creating yearning
in the hearts of lovers by reminding them of each other's merits.
(97E9CTIUNEAT+T41T2TTA1E4U sara) and in patching up love
quarrels (प्रणयकलहकुपितासु कामिनीषु प्रसादनोपायचतुरदूतीव्यापारबहुलतामुप-
feet fra). All the accomplices work more or less as messengers. 64
. These are the female accomplices of the nāyikās but there is
no hard and fast rule fixing them with either the hero or the heroine.
It often happens that an accomplice of one becomes the accomplice
of the other as well.
Besides the female aides, some male characters who belong to the
lower strata of society are mentioned. At the end of the work where
Vişamaśīlā finishes her instructions to Śộngāramañjarī, she tells her
that "you should behave in such a manner that you will not be
looted by the vițas, danced about by the Dhūrtas, laughed at by the
Vayasyas, tortured by the Kadaryas, enjoyed by the Bhujargas,
63. Bharata, Nātyaśāstra, 23, 9 calls her Prativeśyā and enumerates her with the
other female accomplices.
प्रतिवेश्या सखी दासी कुमारी कारुशिल्पिनी।
धात्री पाषण्डिनी चैव दूत्यः स्त्रीक्षणिकास्तथा।
64. Bhoja in the 29th chapter of the SP. treats of forty-eight love conditions,
generally called Dūtasampresaņādi. In it we read of sandeśadana, nāyaka-
nayana etc. which correspond to the duties of the dutis referred to here.

destroyed by the Pāşandas, bewitched by the Rāgins, cheated by the
Vidagdhas" and so on. Besides this reference we find the mention
of Anucara, Sarvarika, Khala and Dindika also.
The Vayasya and the Anucara are the male counterparts of the
Vayasyā and the Anucari. The Anucara is not only a devoted friend
of the nāyaka but is only slightly inferior to him in virtues.65
Dhūrta is a hypocrite, a perfect swindler. He frequents the courte-
sans' quarters and is a past-master in cheating the courtesans and
their ‘mothers'. In this work, in order to indicate the glory of the
unconquerable Visamasilā it is said about her. मूलदेवं मूलहारं व्याहरति ।
STRETF Taifa Hetafraoufti (p. 17). Mūladeva 66 is the classical Dhūrta
of the popular tales. Śaśin is an alternative name for Śaśa who is a
Vița and a bosom companion of Mūladeva.67 A Vița is generally
described as a sensualist or a rogue who is impoverished in the pur-
suit of a fast life. He also frequents the courtesan's quarters and
therefore is usually an aide to the hero in furthering his romantic
65. Mandāra-maranda-campū, p. 79, T TT 1777: foffaggi TGTUT: / :
66. Mūladeva, who is also called Karnīsuta, is referred to in the Mịcchakatika of
Sudraka as an author of aphorisms on theft (Act III). Bāņa, in his Kadambarī
refers to him with his companions thus:
fuit auctoriela Afafafaqopas RTTTTTAT I (p. 40) on which, the
commentator writes (p. 41) Butun: #224; FTASTIFTTT : 1 Fiat TEH
सखायौ द्वौ विपुलाचल संज्ञको। शशो मन्त्रिवरस्तस्य” इति बृहत्कथायां कथा निबद्धा ।
In the Dhurtākhyāna of Haribhadrasūri (c. 800 A.C. edited by Upadhye, A. N.,
Bombay, 1944), which is a story of five rogues recounting their own fantastic
experiences, there is the mention of Mūladeva, also called Mülaśrī, as the master
of the rogues, and his friend Śaśa. Kșemendra, in his Kalāviläsa describes this
Master of Dhūrtas in the company of his friends instructing a merchant's son
in the art of roguery and hypocrisy as practised by cheats, harlots, traders and
others.
स्फटिकासनोपविष्ट: सह शशिना निविभागमित्रेण।
कन्दलीमुख्यैः शिष्यैः परिवारितपादपीठान्तः ।।
The Kathāsaritsagara has stories about Mūladeva and he is placed in the court
of Vikramaditya. Both these characters figure together in the present work
(thirteenth tale). Further details regarding Mūladeva can be gleaned from
De's paper on Bhāna, JRAS 1926, and, M. Bloomfields' "The Character and
Adventuress of Müladeva' in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical
Society, Vol. 52 (1913), pp. 616 ff. .
See 'Dhurtākhyāna', A Critical Study, p. 23.
67. The hero of Sūdraka's Bhāna (in the Caturbhāņi) is Śaśa. He introduces him-
self as a friend of Mūladeva
स एवास्मि मूलदेवसखः शशोऽहम् ।
In the above-quoted verse from Kalāvilāsa (Note 2,' p. 89) we see that Śaśa is
called Sasin and Kșemendra consistently uses this alternate name. Therefore in
the SMK where the corrupt reading is if it has been corrected to feta and
not to TT keeping the name Sašin in view.

adventures. The courtesans are afraid of him for he knows their
ways completely. Bharata describes him thus:68
वेश्योपचारकुशलो मधुरो दक्षिणः कविः ।
ऊहापोहक्षमो वाग्मी चतुरश्च विटो भवेत् ॥
But Kşemendra speaks69 of him rather disrespectfully:
क्षीणाय गुणहीनाय सदोषाय कलाभृते ।
विटाय कृष्णपक्षेन्दुकुटिलाय नमो नमः ।।
Bhoja calls him guņavān70; some describe him as a master of
one art71; some as a master of the science of erotics72; and some as
the master of all arts73.
Another colourful personality referred to in the work is
a dindika. (डिण्डिकपर्षदिव परग्रन्थिस्रावणजातनिवहा। p. 18). A dindika
is a character of a low order on a par with vulgar men like
the Dhūrta and the Vița. The fourth Bhāņa in the Caturbhāņā
---Padatāạitakam of śyāmlaka-practically turns upon him. The
fourth introductory stanza says that the solemn officers of the king
may go but let those who are clever in understanding the amusing
sport of the dindikas (डिण्डिकविनर्मकलाविदग्धाः ) stay on.
The diņdikas are described as ugly like the monkeys in the
aforesaid Bhana (डिण्डिनो हि नामैते नातिविप्रकृष्टा वानरेभ्यः p. 21) and
in actions are the devils themselves (लाटडिडिनो नामैते नातिभिन्ना
पिशाचेभ्यः ) They are narcissistic profhigates and even worse than
the vițas in lewd ways.

A CRITICAL APPRECIATION OF THE SMK

The reference in this text compares the bawd Vişamaśīlā to a
group of dindikas who accumulate wealth by "draining the purses
of others” (groferatan). Explaining the words we may conjecture
that the dindika was the fore-runner of the pickpocket of today.
Granthi may either refer to the knotted money bags or to the knot
tied at the belt of the lower garment; and the clever dindika must
have been adept in taking away the money by sleight of hand.
To the class of the dindika also belongs the Khala, the rogue.
In the Desopadeśa 75 he is described as a dishonest man without any
principles.
The Kadarya is the close-fisted miser. A vivid and interesting
picture is given of him in the Desopadeśa.76 The avaricious and
miserly wretch does not even bear to spend his wealth after his
own people. He is afraid of taking nicely to the visitors lest they
should stay with him. His wealth is no blessing to him, but it
worries him all the time. The courtesan therefore is rightly advised
to stay away from him.
There is a reference in the text to the Sâmvarikas (p. 21). This
may mean magicians. For iafia and at in writing can be
variants for शाम्बरिक and शम्बर, श and स as well as ब and व
being interchangeable. 'Sambara' means māyā and magic, SO
sārivarikas are magicians or miracle-workers. But as the magi-
cians (Fruifan:) have already been referred to immediately
above, an emendation has been suggested, namely, hiachft: mean-
ing astrologers. And with the drift of the passage the emendation
would not be inconsistent as Visamašilā may be described as not
only fearless with regard to human enemies like the magicians but
she would be indifferent even to the influence of the stars.
The common meaning of Bhujariga is paramour. Halāyudha??
defines the word as Veśyāpati. The words Pāşanda, Rāgin and Vidu-
gdha convey the ordinary senses.
These are the different types of personalities mentioned in the
SMK which have been defined and described in works on poetics,
erotics and other literary works. From the numerous references it
can be inferred that these classes of people constituted a considerable
element in society.
The words like Vița and Dhūrta have been retained as such in
translation and elsewhere for they convey particular meanings and
are difficult to be rendered into English.

Judging from all these points of view we can say that this work
of Bhoja, the SMK, is an important addition to prose literature in
Sanskrit. On account of its rich contents, references, interests and
its uniqueness of form, the SMK does credit ot the illustrious author
to whom it is ascribed.

CHAPTER V
THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK
Creative art is regarded as the spontaneous expression of a
genius. His talent may find expression through literary art, and
it would, therefore, be unjust to his creativeness to always search
for some purpose in his work. The pleasure of the poet in creative-
ness, however, subsequently gives pleasure to the reader and, there-
fore, 'to delight' came to be regarded as the aim of a poet. After the
poet attained Heaven, as Bhāmaha says, his body remained on earth,
pure and pleasant in the shape of his poem. It continued to delight
the reader and it also won fame for the poet. Acquisition of fame,
therefore, appealed to the poet as an aim to be pursued. Thus,
writers on poetics recognize both pleasure (Priti) and fame (Kirti)
as the two purposes of a kāvya.? But when natural expression be-
came difficult, the poet attempted to exhibit his erudition. Erudition
Vyutpatti2 came to be regarded as one of the requisities of a poet
and it prompted the poet to impart instruction to the reader, though
unobtrusively as a beloved would do. The poet being always wed-
ded to poverty could not achieve the above-mentioned aims easily;
therefore, he sought patrons, mostly kings. 'It was the duty of the
king to bridge the gulf between wealth and poetic talent', and so
the poet wrote also with a view to please the patron and thus to gain
wealth (Artha) for himself. Other objectives like warding off evil3
and obtaining fruition of the four ends in life, dharma, artha, kama
and mokşam, or at least the first three5 ---- though subsidiary as re-
gards kāvya — came to be regarded as the poet's purposes.
Poets of the classical period wrote with one or more of the
above-mentioned purposes in view. This work does not in the
beginning mention in so many words the purpose underlying it.
Yet, indirectly, the purpose of story-telling in general, and this work

in particular, is found in the request of Bhoja's friends to him to
narrate a tale:
तदतिनिबिडकौतुकाचान्तचेतसामस्माकं प्रीत्यै व्युत्पत्तये च कामप्यपूर्वां व्युत्पाद्य कथां
EFTTI Farat (p. 1)
From this we gather that the present work serves two of the
above-mentioned ends of the poet, namely, prīti and vyutpatti.
The tales, obviously, give delight, and thus serve the first purpose,
while the morals they convey expound some of the topics of Poetics
and Erotics and thus serve the second purpose by advancing know-
ledge.
In this chapter we shall deal with the second purpose. It
attempts to teach the maxims or rules of conduct a courtesan has
to follow regarding the shaping of her own way of living by a
thorough understanding of the different kinds of attachments and
the ways of men, and thus making a success of harlotry as a pro-
fession.
The first four stories explain the topic of rāga or attachment.
Rāga is a technical term which has been explained in detail in the
SP by Bhoja. It will be discussed later. The remaining nine tales
expound the maxims a courtesan has to follow to make her life a
success.
In the books on Erotics and Poetics these subjects have been
discussed. In the present work, however, though the topics remain
mainly identical, they are presented in a literary garb which rescues
them from the otherwise inevitable unsavouriness noticeable in some
works of a similar character.
On analysing the stories we find, as said above, that the varieties
of rāga have been illustrated in the first four stories. The topic is
introduced in a simple manner. Vişamaśīlā tells Śrngäramañjarī
that the world is full of persons of different natures; every man has
his own ideas and leanings; when he comes to a courtesan his mind
is 'coloured' by some sort of attachment which varies in degree and
kind from that of other persons; his attitude is also different and,
therefore, to understand the attitude of a man it is essential for her
to ascertain the exact shade of his "attachment'. She can then deal
with him to her advantage.
After this. cautionary admonition Vişamasilā enumerates the
different kinds of rāgas and classifies them into four divisions of
Nīlīrāga, Mañjişthārāga, Kusumbharāga and Haridrārāga. The
others, representing as they do only the shades of these four, are
also included and, therefore, these four alone have been described in
detail in the stories.




Page 80****************************************************************************************
THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK
87
At the outset it would be proper to understand the technical
character of rāga as conceived by Bhoja and other writers.
(ii)
In the SKA Bhoja mentions by name the three rāgas: Nīlī
Kusumbha and Mañjișthā.6 In the SP however, the same topic has
been treated with exhaustiveness and completeness in enumeration,
classification and illustration,
Räga is considered as one of the essential elements in develop-
ing the śșrgārarasa,? which is the foremost of the nine rasas usually
accepted by the writers on poetics. The Śrrgārarasa--the senti-
ment of love is quite different from Bhoja's other Rasa-Śrnyāra
the conception of which is an original contribution of his to the
science of Poetics. The later writers on poetics who quote Bhoja's
authority on śrngāra betray confusion in understanding his theory
of Rasa-Śrngāra, probably because of the employment by him of one
and the same word, śmrgāra, with two different connotations as
well as by his insistence upon the importance of both the kinds of
Śrngāra.
Bhoja's conception of Rasa-śặngāra is given here in essence in
order to distinguish it from the śrīgāra-rasa of which rāga is an im-
portant element.
Bhoja's one and only Rasa-śrngāra is Abhimana or Aharikāra
which dwells in the soul of all persons and the difference in the
degree of its intensity in a person is due to the experience of many
past births. It is responsible for the emergence of other qualities
and its presence endows a poem with elegance."
This fundamental state of rasa is called rasa of Parākoţi.
In the second stage, the Madhyamāvasthā, the fortynine diffe-
rent bhāvas grow out of this rasa. Stimulated by Vibhāvas, Anu-

bhāvas and so, on, the bhāvas reach their prakarsa-climax-and are
then called rasas, 10 The basic Śrngāra does not lose its character
in this second stage, for consistently with his theory of TMT Tato

The passage from the second stage to the third and final stage-
paramakāșthā or uttarakoți — is simple. For after the full evolu-
tion of the bhāvas into rasas, they culminate in one rasa which is
then technically called Preman.

This, in short, is Bhoja's theory of Śrngāra which has been fully
elaborated in the SP.
It has been already stated that this theory of Rasa-śrngāra in
all its details is an original contribution of Bhoja to the science of
Poetics. In keeping with his habit of drawing from Dandin in sup-
port of his various statements or views, Bhoja attempts to support
his theory of Rasa-śrngāra also by falling back on the authority of
Daņdin. To this end he quotes the stanza:
प्रेयः प्रियतराख्यानं रसवद्रसपेशलम्।
उर्जस्वि रूढाहंकारं युक्तोत्कर्ष च तत् त्रयम् ।।
from the KA13 and harnesses it to the services of his own theory by
reinterpreting it. 14 And probably his terminology-Anamkāra,
Abhimana and śộngāra (bhāva-prakarsa), rasa and Preman have
been coined so as to correspond to Dandin's Rūdhāhamkāra, Rasavad

and Preyas. The common syngāra-rasa, which is called the rati-
prakarşa-śțngāra in the scheme, is the sentiment which with its
various aspects becomes the subject of delineation and analysis of
the alamkārikas. We shall now see how Bhoja treats of this śộngāra-
rasa.
Śrågāra-rasa, asserts Bhoja, is the foremost of the rasas because
rati is the best amongst the bhāvas. 15 Bhoja has emphasised its
importance by devoting 19 chapters out of 36 in the SP to it. He
calls this Srngāra Kāmaśộngāra' also. He states that Rasa-śrngara
is qadi.FT TUTĘ i.e. it is śrågāra only that prompts men to diffe-
rent activities for the achievement of the four puruşārthas: Dharma,
Artha, Kāma and Mokşa. Corresponding to these are four śrngāras,
dharmaśộngāra, arthaśțngāra, kāmaśşugăra and mokşaśțngāra. 16
Bhoja identifies this Kāmasrngāra with the rati-prakarsa-śțigăra.17
In the 22nd chapter of the SP which deals with Anurāgasthāpana
Bhoja says that amongst these four KāmaśȚngāra is the most im-
portant because it is the cause of the other śțăgăras. 18
The last 16 chapters in SP deal with the Kāmaśặngāra according
to the following scheme:-
Kāmaśộngāra* (Chapter XX)
Vipralambhasrngāra
Sambhogaśmrgāra
(chapts. XXIV-XXXII)
(chapts. XXXIII-XXXVI)
The treatment of this Śạngāra, which Bhoja calls Kāmaśțngāra
or Ratiprakarşaśrngāra, with its two kinds, Vipralambha and San-
bhoga, developed under the four conditions of Pūrvānurāga, Māna,
Pravāsa and Karuņa in Vipralambha, and the Pūrvānurāgānantara,
Mānānantara, Pravāsānantara and Karunānantara in Sarnbhoga

the ordinarily accepted dharmaśrugāra etc. Cf. Sarvānanda, Amarakoșa-

in common to all the works on Poetics that deal with rasas. But.
Bhoja with his love for analysis goes further. He takes the etymo-
logical meanings of the prepositions vi and sam and elaborates the
types and stages of Śrngāra.
The Vipralambha śrngāra is treated in chapters 24-32. the
Sambhoga in chapters 33-36. It is relevant to our purpose to
consider only the Sambhoga-śȚrgāra which we shall now examine.
The preposition sam, according to Bhoja, conveys four senses:
संक्षिप्त, संकीर्ण, संपूर्ण and सम्यक् । Therefore, when Bhoga is deve-
loped under the four conditions of Pūrvānurāgānantara, etc. it ex-
presses itself in four types in Sambhogaśặngāra thus. Pūrvānurāgä-
nantara-sambhoga is of samkşipta type, that is, short in point of
time; Mānānantara is Samkīrṇa, that is, alloyed 19; Pravāsanantara is
Sampūrņa, that is complete; while Karuņānantaru is Samyak, that
is, perfect. These four types of Sambhoga have four stages or ava-
sthās which are treated in the 36th and the last chapter of the
SP. The four stages corresponding to the four types of Sambhoga
are Sattā, Abhivyakti, Anubandha and Prakarsa. Thus it is said:
संक्षिप्तो भोगः सत्तावस्थायाम्, संकीर्णो भोगः अभिव्यक्त्यवस्थायाम्, संपूर्णो भोग: अनुबं-
धावस्थायाम्, सम्यक् भोगः प्रकर्षावस्थायाम् ।20
The Sattā stage is the origin of rati on the meeting of the nayaka
and the nāyikā; abhivyakti is the clear perceptibility developed under
the stimulus of Vibhāvas and so on; Anubandha is the condition of
continuation, and Prakarsa is the climax in which rati results, in the
śrågāra-rasa.
In the further analysis of the Sattā and other stages, Bhoja says
there are subtle differences among them. In each stage there are
twelve different shades. The twelve shades in the Sattā stage are
those of rāgas, those in the Abhivyakti stage are the twelve premans,
those in the Anubandha stage are also the twelve premans, and
those in the prakarsa stage are the twelve Prema-pakas.21 Thus
the elaborate Sambhoga-śrngāra under the:
4 Conditions is of 4 Types in the 4 Stages with 12 Shades.

THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK
61
This is the position of Rāga in the scheme of Saribhoga-śrngāra,
and as the present work is concerned only with the twelve shades of
rāgas, we shall confine our attention only to them.
(iii)
Sambhoga of the Samkşipta type in the Sattā stage, it has been
stated above, is the origin of rati on the meeting of the two. But
the nature and kind of rati or love depends upon the quality of his
‘rāga'. Rāga is called upādhi' or adjunct because it transmits to the
mind its own colour.
तत्र संक्षेपपक्षे रागोपाधिः प्रेमाणि द्वादशप्रकारं भवति ।
The twelve rāgas enumerated in the SP are the following: Haridrā,
Rocana, Kāṁpilya, Rīti, Kusumbha, Lākṣā, Akşība, Mañjişthā, Kar-
dama, Kāşāya, Sakala and Nīlī, which are the same as those given
in the SMK. After the enumeration of the rāgas, the SP proceeds
to classify them according to the Sättvika, Rājasa and Tāmasa nature
of men,
अथैष विशिष्टनायकविषयो विशेषरूपं उच्यते । स च सात्त्विकादिनायकभेदात् स्थिरा-
स्थिरत्वादितारतम्यात् प्रबन्धेन उपपाद्यमानो द्वादशप्रकारं उत्पद्यते ।23
In the 15th chapter where Bhoja deals with the nāyakus, he lists
their common classification into Dhirodátta, Dhīroddhata, Dhiralalita
and Dhiraśānta. He goes further and divides each of these four
again into various kinds according to their four features, guna,
prakrti, pravṛtti and parigraha. 24 According to Prakṣti or nature
the nāyaka is described as of three kinds; sättvika, räjasa and tāmasa.
The distribution of the twelve rāgas between the three kinds of
nāyakas according to their temperaments is thus made:
तत्र हरिद्रारागं रोचनरागं कांपिल्यरागं रीतिरागं इति सात्विकस्य । कुसुम्भरागं लाक्षारागं
अक्षीबरागं मञ्जिष्ठारागं इति राजसस्य । कर्दमरागं कषायरागं सकलरागं नीलीरागं इति तामसस्या
So, explaining the term frāga' technically it can be said that
rāga is attachment in twelve shades which colours the minds of the
nāyakas experiencing the Sattā stage of love (gaft TTTFT- CH-TTTT
TTTT) according to their temperaments.

(iv)
There is no other work which treats of the subject of rāga in
such detail. But it is evident from stray references that the con-
cept of rāga with its different names was current long before Bhoja's
time.
Vātsyāyana takes rāga as a synonymn of love. रसो रतिः
प्रीतिर्भावो रागो वेगः समाप्तिरिति रतिपर्यायाः। 26 Jayamangala explains it
as 3TZITUTIST TIT: 127 Vātsyāyana does not specifically mention the
different kinds of rāgas, but in the sixth chapter we read बालो वा
नैकत्रदृष्टिरतिसंधानप्रधानो वा हरिद्रारागो वा यत्किचनकारी वेत्यवेत्य संदिध्यन्न वा । 28
on which Jayamangala says: हरिद्रारागो वेति। हरिद्राराग इव रागो यस्य न
चिरस्थायी। मयि विरक्तो यत्र गतस्तत्रापि विरक्तः पुनरागन्तुकामः कि दास्यति ।
This shows that though Vātsyāyana does not define the varieties of
rāgas yet he and the author of the Jayamangalā are familiar with the
different names and natures of the rāgas.
Following Bhoja the Agnipurāna in the Alankára seciion
mentions three kinds of rāgas as an Ubhayaguna of kāvya.
हारिद्रश्च कौसुम्भो नीलीरागश्च स विधा। वैशेषिक: परिज्ञेयो यः स्वलक्षणगोचरः ।29
This section is considered as borrowed by the compiler of the
Purāņa from Bhoja, so we cannot vouch for its originality.30 The
only work prior to Bhoja, which mentions the varieties of rāga, is
Ksemendra's Samayamātrka. In it, as in our text, the bawd in-
structs the courtesan in the secrets of harlotry. The knowledge
of the rāga is described as the essential equipment for pursuing har
lotry as a profession successfully.
अथ मन्मथमत्तानां करिणामिव कामिनाम् ।
बन्धाय बन्धकी शिक्षामाचचक्षे जरच्छिखा ।।
पूर्व भावपरीक्षैव कार्या यत्लेन कामिनाम् ।

The rāgas that he enumerates and classifies are numerous. He gives
eight classes having eight kinds or rāgas each, besides 16 other mis.
cellaneous rāgas. The eight classes are:
१ वर्णानुकारिन् २ धात्वनुकारिन् ३ गगनसंगिन्

THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK

The first group of Rāgas contains many names similar to rāgas men-
tioned above. Thus:
कुसुम्भरागः सिन्दूररागः कुंकुमरागवान् । लाक्षारागोऽथ माञ्जिष्ठो रागः काषायरागभृत्।।
हारिद्रो नीलरागश्चेत्यष्टै वर्णानुकारिणः । सुवर्णरागस्ताम्राख्यो रीतिरागस्तथापरः ॥2
One rāga of the second class — the rītirāga -- is mentioned in our
text. All others are different from those enumerated in the SMK.
Among the post-Bhoja authorities Viśvanātha is the only one to
notice some of the rāgas, and in this he does nothing more than fol-
low Bhoja's SKA. He says:
आदौ वाच्यः स्त्रिया रागः पश्चात् पुंसस्तदिङिगतैः ।
नीलीकुसुम्भं मञ्जिष्ठा पूर्वरागोऽपि च त्रिधा ।।33
Among the lexicographers Yadavaprakāsa,34_Halāyudhass and
Hemacandra 36 mention and define the Nīlī and the Haridrā rāgas,
(v)
Now we can examine critically the basis of the classification,
natures and illustrations of the rāgas as given by the various texts.
The basis of classification in the SMK is according to vargas
or classes. Four primary rāgas, namely the Nili, the Manjisthā, the
Kusumbha and the Haridrā form the classes. There are three in
each of these vargas, but there is no specific reason given for the
division.
The classification of the SP is more scientific. It is according
to the three natures of the nāyakas. Thus there is a difference in
the pattern of the division of rāgas in the SMK and the SP. Thus:
SMK (4 vargas)
SP (3 natures)
रीति
नीली ____मंजिष्ठा कुसुम्भ हरिद्रा
हरिद्रा कुसुम्भ कदम
कषाय लाक्षा रोचन
रोचन लाक्षा कषाय
अक्षीब सकल कर्दम काम्पिल्य काम्पिल्य अक्षीब सकल
रीति मञ्जिष्ठा नीली
Despite this difference in the basis of classification in the two
texts, it is interesting, though not surprising, to note the very close
verbal similarity in the description and divisions of rāgas in them.
As both the works are from the pen of one author, they should

therefore, be hazarded that one — SP — is a theoretical work whose
theories the other --SMK - demonstrates; in other words, the
stories of the SMK have been written to exemplify the technical

The classification of the Samayamātskā into eight classes is based
on specific materials like colours, metals etc. The division is too
elaborate and mechanical and it has not the merit of being based
upon the psychological working of men's minds.
The following table will show the different natures and the
illustrations of the rāgas.37

transcripts of the Ms. of the SP which were very kindly supplied by Dr. V.
Raghavan. The incompleteness of details in some aspects is therefore due to
the inaccessibility of the Ms. See Appendix II.

ŠĶNGARAMAÑJARIKATHA
The tabular analysis brings out two points clearly: 1. There
is not much difference in the descriptions of the rāgas. 2. The
four rāgas, Nilī, Haridrā, Mañjiştha and Kusumbha that the SMK
considers to be principal, are accepted as important by all the wri-
ters. They seem to be the most distinguished and oft quoted rägas.
Both the SMK and the SP take the fastness of the colours into
consideration, festetTargaretar is the key to the gradation. In the
SP Bhoja has a method in selecting the rāgas to be explained. He
has taken the treatment of the Sättvika nature first, then the Rājasu
and then the Tāmasa. Within his division also, he has taken the
lightest in colour and the less constant first. Thus for example in
the tāmasa class he takes Kardama, Kāṣāya, Sakala and Nīlī in order
of deepening of colours and the intensity of attachments.
Considering one rāga after another we follow SP's method in
treating the rāgas of the Sättvika nature first. Due to the predomin-
ance of Sattva in these people their rāgas do not leave any permanent
impressions on their minds and do not impede their normal work
in any manner. The lightest amongst this class of rāgas is the
Haridrā-rāga. Haridrā is turmeric, bright yellow in colour. 3? Its
colour is not fast and it fades in the sun. So the Haridrā-räga of
a man also vanishes at the slightest excuse. Eferatsfer arfts: guria
fa pauta 39 SP says that in this case Kāma is ineffective owing
to the excess of qualities like compassion which are characteristic
of the sättvika temperament.
Before examining the illustrations supplied mostly by the SMK
and the SP it is important to bear in mind that the examples in
the SP and others are to be judged from a general or social or even
philosophic point of view, while the examples of SMK are based
on a narrower view, namely, the interests and approaches of courte-
sans. Therefore, the interpretations, meanings and values attached
to a rāga according to their benefits would be quite different. For
instance the unflinching steadfastness of the Nīlī-rāga which would
be considered admirable by all, is viewed with great aversion in
the interest of the courtesan's profession and is therefore condemned.
The example in the SP of the Haridra-rāga is Jīmātavāhana's
love for Malayasundarī in Nāgānanda. His love for her does not
prevent him from following his heart's desire, viz., sacrificing his life
for others. In SMK Sūradharman's love for Devadattā (4th tale) does
not prevent him from leaving her house for the safety of the jewel.
His return, however, is due to pity on seeing the miserable con-
38. At one place in the SP, it is described as ofta FFCFIT Trafafai (p. 88
chapter XXIV).

dition of Devadattā's household. Compassion is the motive here, as
S P says:
स हि तथा न कामेन बाध्यते यथा सत्त्वोद्रेकात्करुणादिभिः 140
The Samayamātrkā does not give any explanation for the rāga but
only the colour of Haridrā is taken into consideration.
The next rāga of this class is the Rocana-rāga. Rocana is a
bright yellow shining pigment. A nāyaka of the rocana-raga is
a sättvika type of man who possesses sattva-guņa in a greater degree.
His attachment does not obstruct his other activities prompted by
dharma, etc. Therefore it is not difficult to forget it, but a great
cause is necessary to give it up. As for instance Duşyanta's love
for Sakuntalā, which was forgotten due to the curse of Durvāsas.
SMK gives no illustration but includes it in the Haridrā class.
Kāmpilya is a tree which has bright red seeds. As a colour
it is deeper than Rocana. Not only a great cause is necessary to
remove it, but a great effort is to be made as well. Therefore it
is said to belong to a nāyaka of ati-sättvika nature. The example
in the SP is that of Hariscandra in the Hariscandra-carita where
Hariscandra forced himself to forget his love for his wife to free
himself from the clutches of Viśvāmitra. SMK has no example but
places it in the Haridrārāga-varga.
The last of the Sättvika-rāgas, Rīti, is the fastest. It belongs to
the ati-mahāsāttvika nāyaka. The example in the SP is from the
Rāmāyaṇa. Rāma continued to love Sitä even after driving her
out due to the people's criticism. SMK offers no example, but places
Rītī-rāga in the Nīlirāga varga. Samayamātşkä says: TESTET
मालिन्यं स्नेहेनाप्युपजायते ।
Now we come to the rāgas of the Rājasa hero. The characteris-
tic of these rāgas is that when another rāga happens to influence
them, the original rāgas only deepen further but do not vanish alto-
gether. Of these the first is Kusumbha. Kusumbha is saffron,
bright red in colour. The nāyaka possessing the Kusumbharāga is
smart. He has no consideration for Dharma or Artha, but only
Kāma. As soon as this person gets attached to another person of
greater merit, his attachment for the first person vanishes. SP
gives Vásudeva's love in Harivansa as an instance, in which case
Väsudeva's love for the gopis becomes less on meeting the ladies of
Dvārakä. In the SMK Mādhava possesses the Kusumbharāga.
After enjoying Kuvalayāvali's company he desires to go away.
When she and her mother follow him he forgets his attachment,

punishes them and feels satisfied with what he has done. According
to SamayamātȚkā this rāga vanishes when it is not protected.
Though not specifically mentioned we can take Somadatta (7th
tale) and Vinayadhara (10th tale) as heroes of the rājasa-prakști
possessing Kusumbha-rāga. When Somadatta realizes that he is
deceived he is stung to the quick and takes revenge. Similarly
Vinayadhara returns to punish the bawd after he had been driven
out.
The SKA41 and the Sāhityadarpana42 explain it as being bright,
but liable to fade away. (ucha 7 Tiha)
Lākṣā is lac which is bright red in colour. As a colour it belongs
to a person who has too much rajas in him. The example in the
SP is of Purūravas losing his love for the queen on seeing
Urvasi. SMK has no example but puts it in the Kusumbha-varga.
Samayamātṣkā compares the characteristics of the lac with this
rāga. 7a: fascyfa TATTG:4:57 0 Artife was: 43 Akşība is also a tree.
This rāga can be removed only with great difficulty. The instance
in SP is Vatsarāja's love for Vāsavadattā as described in the Tāpa-
savatsarāja. There Vatsarāja is made to forget Vāsavadattā with
great efforts by his ministers for the purpose of turning his mind
towards the conquest of his lost kingdom. SMK has no example but
places it in the Nīlīrāga-varga.
Mañjişthā is Indian madder. As a rāga it is deepest among the
rājasa rāga, and it cannot be given up even with great effort. SP
quotes Kuvalayāśva's love for Madalasa in the Madalasopākhyāna
as an instance. In the SMK, Mañjisthā-rāga forms a class by itself,
and it is described as being so fast that it fades but never vanishes
completely. Tatūrufa 7 Tha 44 Vikramasimha (2nd tale) is of
this nature. He boldly approaches Mālatikā, but being once offend-
ed stops going to her though his attachment for her is never lost.
The Samayamātņkā describes it as 791: 1977 Alfs0057 FTTTTTA:
7: 145 i.e. persistent under any circumstances, favourable or other-
wise.
The peculiarity of the rāgas of the Tāmasa class of nāyakas is
that they neither vanish as in the case of the rāgas of the Sättvika
nāyakas, nor do they deepen as in the case of the râjasa rāgas. But
when they are spurned they change into another rāga, that is, some

THE PURPOSE OF THE WORK
changes set into their natures. Of this class the least harmful is
Kardama. Kardama is mud. Its colour does not stick, therefore
as a rāga it is not fast. For example, Agnimitra's love for Mahādevi
and Irāvati which disappears on seeing Mālavikā. A minor point
may be mentioned here. In SP Purūravas's love for the queen is
quoted as an instance of Lākṣā-rāga. Here Agnimitra's love for
the two former queens, which fades on seeing Malavikā, is placed in
the Kardama class. The question is: what is the reason for this
differentiation of calling one rājasa and the other tāmasa in spite
of the apparent similarity of situations in both the cases? Perhaps
an explanation may be sought in Agnimitra's betraying his unsteadi-
ness in love twice while in Pururavas's case it is not so.
The SMK offers no example for this rāga, but places it in the
Kusumbha-rāga-varga.
Käşāya is dull brown red colour.46 The example given in the
SP is Sivagana's love in Vikrāntaśūra. SMK gives no example, but
places it in the Mañjişthā-rāga-varga. Pratāpasimha (11th tale) may
be taken as an example of this type of hero. He is ugly and
sensuous. When Malayasundari teases him he gets wild and like a
ruthless 'tiger' injures her. The Samayamātņkā describes it as
FFTTT the tot 1979: FHEUTTA UFI 47, that is, he is rough in his
attachment but could be adversely affected by affection.
Sakala is a fast colour and cannot be removed with great effort
even when there is a cause for it. SP gives the example of Aja's
love for Indumati in the Raghuvañía. SMK places it in the
Mañjisthā varga. It is difficult to identify Sakala.48
We come lastly to the important and most common Nīlī-rāga.
Nilī is indigo, dark blue in colour. The attachment of the hero is
fastest, most intense in this case, and it is impossible to remove it
under any circumstances. SP says it belongs to the ati-tāmasa hero.
The example given is Vaiśampāyana's love for Mahāśvetā in the
Kādambarī.
48. Cf. T9reT THEY FUTTI
(SP, p. 88. Chapter XXIV).
47. V, 21 b.
48. In the saivatantra the word sakala is applied to soul which has not advanced
beyond the lowest stage of progress, and which is bound by sin, ignorance and
the bonds of action. Cf. Sarvadarśanasangraha of Sāyaṇamādhava (p. 70)
पशुस्त्रिविधः विज्ञानाकलप्रलयाकलसकलभेदात् । 'तृतीयस्तु मलमायाकर्मात्मकबन्धत्रयसहितः
सकल इति संलप्यते।
The work further quotes from Bhoja's own work, Tattvaprakāśa to the same
effect. Can the conception of Sakalarāga have any reference to this technical
meaning of the word in Saivatantra?

ŚÃNGÄRAMAÑJARĪKATHA
SMK puts it similarly that though the man is destroyed in a
hundred ways he does not give up his rāga, just as a cloth dyed in
indigo does not lose its colour even when washed by soda and the
like in many ways. The example is Ravidatta of the first tale.
He is versed in all the śāstras and arts but does not know how to
make practical use of them. He has no sense of discrimination.
Unwittingly he gets caught in the snares laid out by the courtesan
Vinayavati and does not even understand her pretext in driving
him out. Foolishly he waits for her and his tāmasika deep attach-
ment does not leave him till he dies. SKA says: 47 Tahfa warfa-
TTÀI 49 and gives Rāma's love for Sītā, making a golden statue of
hers after' driving her out, as an example. Sāhityadarpaņa also fol-
lows it and says: यथा श्रीरामसीतयोः। 50 Samayamitrka. says: नीलो देहक्षय-
Fetret Tartsafarge: | 15 The lexicographers put it uniformly (to
mean) that the hero is steady in love.52
Now a point may be noted. It has already been pointed out
above that instances in the SP and SMK may differ because in one
it may be from a general point of view, while in SMK it is only
from the point of view of the courtesan's gains and approaches.
Nīlīrāga therefore would be a plague to the courtesan's life, and
therefore it is called Tāmasa. SP also says agfaara II In view
of this it is surprising how SKA gives Rāma as a nāyaka of Tāmasa
nature,
In this context we may refer again to the Rīti-rāga. In
SP it is described as belonging to the Mahā-sättvika-nāyaka, and the
example there given is similar to the one in the SKA, namely, Rāma's
love for Sītā. Therefore is would be more appropriate to take Rāma's
love for Sītā as an example of Rāti-rāga.
This is how the different rāgas are explained and illustrated.
Generally speaking it can be said that the divisions are made accord-
ing to colours, and their qualities of fastness etc. are taken into
consideration. The Samayamātņkā has also a colour division but
the "erotic classification of different types of men after different
kinds of birds and beasts” is not very happy. Bhoja derives
the word from rañj, to colour, and the sattva, rajas and tamas ele-
ments are usually associated with brightness, redness, and darkness
and the materials associated with them have shades of these three

colours; therefore, ihe colour basis for the classification of the diffe-
rent kinds of rāgas is significant and logical.
This is how Bhoja and others treat of the subject of rāga. In
so far as the present work deals with the rāgas we can say that one
of its main purposes has been to illustrate the rägas technically dealt
with in the SP. This points out incidentally its close relationship
with the SKĀ and the SP, and strengthens Bhoja's claim to the
authorship of this work.
The second purpose of the text, as has been mentioned in the
beginning, is to describe certain dangers a courtesan has to guard
against, and to lay down certain rules of conduct she has to follow
to make her life a success. This is done through illustrative stories
which shed interesting side-light upon the institution of courtesan and
also upon certain aspects of the social life of those days. There are
certain technical points regarding the gaạikā as a 'type' of nāyikā
to be considered also. This will be dealt with in the next chapter.

CHAPTER VI
A PICTURE OF THE TIMES
The SMK presents a graphic picture of the times in which it
was written. The main scene is laid in the city of Dhārā, but the
stories take us throughout the length and breadth of India. The
territorial boundaries of the political states changed with the rise
and fall of kingdoms one after another. Social life with its time-
honoured customs and traditions evolved differently in the different
parts of the country, and yet, as we read of various happenings in
the different cities we feel underneath it a deep and constant flow
of cultural homogeneity which presents the picture not of this or
that part of the country, but of the whole of India, one and undivided.
Geography
SMK has a large geographical canvas. From Udyāna in the
north Peshāwar we come to the Simhaladvīpa in the South, and from
Kachcha on the sea in the west to Prāgjyotişa in Assam in the east.
Among the countries Avanti, Kaccha, Nepāla, Pañcāla, Magadha and
Malaya are mentioned. Avanti, the ancient name for Mālwā, with
its capital Ujjayinī is well-known. The present text also refers to
it as:
अस्त्यवन्तिषु श्रीमत्युज्जयिनी नाम नगरी।
The city of Ujjayinī is described as being presided over by Śri Malā-
kālanātha. His heart was captivated by Ujjayini's charm, so he left
his abode on Kailāsa and took up his residence there. In all the
three stories where Ujjayini has been mentioned, Vikramārka or
Sähasāňka or Vikramāditya is referred to as the king. Kaccha and
Nepāla are what they are today. The land of Nepāla is described as
being fragrant with the musk of deer. Ahicchatra (modern Ram-
nagar in Bareilly District, U.P.), the capital of North Pañcāla, and
Kānyakubja (modern Kanoj), the capital of the south Pañcāla, are
mentioned.? Magadha is an ancient name and is identified with
South Bihar. Malaya is Malabar, Cochin and Travancore. Hasii-
nāgapura is the same as Hastināpura, the capital of the Kurus, north-
east of Delhi. There is also a reference to a Hastigräma, a town of
the Brāhmaṇas, on the bank of the Ganges. Kaušāmbi (modern
Kosam on the Yamunā, near Allahabad), the capital of Udayana
(Vatsa country). and Vidiśā (modern Bhilsa) are well known. Prāg-
1. For the identification of the places Nundolal Dey's “The Geographical Dictionary
of Ancient and Mediæval India' has been followed.

A PICTURE OF THE TIMES
jyotişa is idemiified with Gauhati in Assam, and in the text is des-
cribed as being adorned with krsņāguru. The corrupt form of Tām-
ralipii (modern Tamluk in Midnapore District, Bengal)-Tāmalipti-
is given in the text. Kundinapura (modern Kaundinyapur in Chan-
dur täiuk of Amraoti) is ancient capital of Vidarbha Vatsagulma (Ba-
sim in Akola District, M.P.) is another town of Vidarbha as Rājase-
khara states it to be.2 But Vātsyāyana mentions Vatsagulma and
Vidarbha as though in two different countries. However, Vatsa-
gulma situated in Vidarbha would suit the context of the story here
better on account of its being in the vicinity of Mānyakheța. Nāsikya
(modern Nasik) is incidentally referred to. Lāța (Southern Gujarat),
Kerala (Malabar Coast), Konkana and Dravida (South India) have
been mentioned. Küncī is Conjeevaram and its description as having
conquered the three worlds by its wealth of beauty would be proper
since it was the capital of the powerful Pallavas since the ninth
century. Uragapura was the capital of the Colas and Pallavas, who
after being forced into obscurity by Kalabhras, Pāņdyas and Pallavas
reached their zenith of power in the 11th century and ruled over
the whole of the Tamil country. It is referred to as having a power-
ful king. The town has been variously identified with Uraiyur on
the southern bank of Kaveri near Trichinopolit (present name Tiru-
cherapalli), Nagapattam and with Madurā.
Another great capital of a powerful contemporaneous kingdom
mentioned is Mānyakheta (modern Malkhed in Hyderabad State).
It is said in the 8th tale that the hero was in Pundravardhana and
desired to join the services of the sovereign of Mānyakheța. From
Pundravardhana he went to Vidiśā, thence to Bhāillasvāmidevapura,
from there to the town of Pūrņapathaka, and then to Mānyakheța.
Pundravardhana (modern Mahästhān near Bogra) is in North
Bengal. Vidiśü is modern Bhilsā in Madhya Bharat. Bhūillasvāmi-
devapura” is 12 miles from Bisnagara. From there he entered
Pärnapathaka in Berar. The identification of this town is somewhat
difficult. But in the modern district of Parbhani (C.P.) we read of
a town called Purna, which is on the way to Mānyakheța. We can

take that as identical with our Pūrņapathaka.9 Manyakheța was
the capital of the Rāștrakūțas whose feudatory was Siyaka, Bhoja's
grandfather. He had, however, thrown off the suzerainty of Mānya-
kheța. After the Rāştrakūtas, Taillapa, the Cālukya, who ultimately
defeated Bhoja's uncle Muñja, was ruling from Mānyakheța; there-
fore the echo of Mānyakheța being the seat of a sovereign ruler is
heard in the text.
Simhala-dvipa is the southernmost extremity of India that is
mentioned, and Udyāna is the northern-most. Udyāna is identified
with Uddayāna situated on the Swat river.
The most important city mentioned is, of course, Dhārā, the
capital of the Paramāras. It was during the rule of Vairasimha or
Sīyaka II that Dhārā became the capital of the Paramāras. 10)
In the Navasāhasänka-carita of Padmagupta, a poet at the court of
Bhoja's uncle Muñja and his father Sindhurāja, Dhārā is called the
'other Capital (aparā kularājadhānī).11 And historians record that
Bhoja rebuilt the city in the middle of the 11th century and trans-
ferred the capital there from Ujjayini. 12 It is taken to be the most
distinguished city during Bhoja's time, and the description of the
city that we get, though conventional, speaks of the wealth and
prosperity of the city.
Two islands outside India are mentioned, namely, Suvarnadvīpa
and Ratnadvīpa. Suvarnadīpa is in South East Asia and can be
roughly identified with Sumatra. Ratnadvīpa is one of the islands
near Java. There is the usual reference about these places that
merchants from India went to these places and returned laden with
riches.
Among the mountains the well-known Himācalai, Kailasa, Meru,
Anjanagiri. Mandara, Rohaņācala, Amaragiri, Mekula, the Sukti-
mantaparvata and the Śrīparvata are mentioned. Mekala is the
same as Amarakanțaka from which the Narmadā takes its rise. Śrī-
parvata is in the South.13 Rohaņācala is the Adam's peak in Ceylon,
also called Sumana-Kūța. suktimantaparvata is a portion of the
Vindhya range.

Among the rivers Kālindī is mentioned. Narmadā is called
Mekalakanyakā. The Gangā is described as Tripathagā and Mandā-
kinī. Śiprā in Ujjayini and its tributary Gambhīrā are mentioned.
Tāpī is given a rare variant, Tapani. The present Sābarmati is call-
ed Sambhramavati.14 Tāmraparņī in the South is conventionally
described as having pearls.
Kingship and Administration
The head of an Imperial State was called Cakravartin. He
ruled over the neighbouring kings. The description of the king of
Uragapura (9th tale) is the conventional description of a sovereign,
स चतुरशीतेः सामन्तानां द्वादशानां च मण्डलेश्वराणां पत्रिंशतश्च राजकूलिकानां द्वासप्तते-
राटविकपल्लीपतीनां च चतुर्विशतेः काष्टानामेकविंशतेः कोकणानां पत्रिंशतश्च वेलाकुलाना-
#rf$797447TTC (p. 60)
The reference to the thirty-six Räjakulikās' is a reference to the
ruling royal families. 15 The Konkaņas are the people of Konkan, the
Kärvātas are the people of the villages and the Velākulas refer to the
people living in the thirty-two ports that might have existed then.
The Ațavikas refer to the forest tribes of Śabaras, Bhillas, Barbaras
and the like.
The whole of the kingdom was divided into a number of
mandalas (provinces) and governors were appointed who were called
maņqaleśvaras. Mandalas were further divided into bhogas and
visayas. The sāmanta was in charge of the visaya. Together with
these the other two officials mentioned herein are the dandapāśika
and the mahattama. The Bhoga was further divided into pathaka.
We have a reference to the Malayavişaya and the Pūrņpathaka.
In those days kingship was not nominal. The king was the
constitutional as well as the executive head of the State,
The life of a victorious king was a judicious mixture of duty
and pleasure. His burden of the care of his kingdom (rājyapālana)
and studies of the Sāstras (Šāstravicāra) were lightened by his hob-
bies like fighting elephants (Gajendrānanuyodhayan) and riding
horses (vājino vāhayan), practising archery (sāyakabhyāsa), wit-
nessing the practice of warfare (yuddhāvalokana) and learning the
use of arms (sastrăbhyāsa). Light amusements and sports like hunt-
in a monastery in southern India associated with his name is preserved upto
the present day in the name 'Nāgārjunikonda'. (EI, XX 1929-30, p. 22, Ins-
cription F. Second Apsidal Temple Inscriptions (line 3). Edited by Prof. J.
Ph. Vogel). This would help us to locate the exact site of the Śrīparvata.
14. KM calls it śvabhravatî (chapter 17, p. 94).
This reference to the thirty-six ruling families is important, as it is earlier in
point of time to Kalhana's (c. 1159 A.D.) reference in the Rājatarangiņā.
Mr. C. V. Vaidya, op. cit., (p. 388) gives a list of the thirty-six Ruling families
and holds the view that it was drawn up during the time of Candra Gāhadavāla
who ruled from 1080-1100 A.D.

ing (mrgayā), roaming through woods (udyānaviharaņa), watersports
(jala-krīdā), the company of beloved (praņayinīsamāgama), meeting
of friends (pranayagoșthī) and witnessing dramatic performances
(prekşā) were equally important for him.
These occupations speak of his accomplishments in the afore-
said arts and sciences also and bring to our mind the picture of a
king, sound and healthy in mind, body and spirits. A good ruler
was also a good artist (kulagļham kalānām) and a learned man
(pramadodyānam vidyālatānām). Dharma and Nīti found equal
place in his life (prabhavo dharmasya, nidhānam niteh). The result
was that kingship did not leave him either a ruler without learning,
or an artist without character or a master without appreciation of
the beauties of life. His accomplishments helped him to build up
and live fully a well-balanced life.
The gifted people sought the patronage of kings in all their
endeavours. There were held special courts where the works and
achievements of the poets, artists and others were examined, and
the king usually signified his appreciation of merit by awarding
handsome gifts. As a matter of fact following this normal practice
of the kings of old like Sātavāhana, Śūdraka and Sāhasănka it was
laid down in works like the Kävyamīmāmsā that kings should hold
literary courts to promote the advancement of cultural activities. 10
When fortunately the king was gifted with poetic talent himself,
he found it easy to collect the best talents of the day round him.
It is interesting to observe that the SMK is set in the atmosphere
of one of these literary assemblies of the times. It was summer
and the king, surrounded by a few relatives, friends and learned
people, was seated in the bejewelled and cool dhārāgrha on the
central high pavilion, The king is requested by those present to
tell them a new story for their delectation. There is an exchange
of views regarding the virtue in speaking about oneself. Ultimately
the king starts off with the tale which would please his friends as
well as the literary connoisseurs. This small introductory passage
in SMK indicates the traditions of the actual literary courts of
Bhoja.17
The king, it may be supposed, ruled justly but there can be no
doubt that his personal prejudices and predilections played an im-
portant part in the administration; on his favours or frowns depended
even the lives of the people. 18

phants were given to Devadattă (5th tale) and Lāvanyasundarſ (6th tale).
Similarly king Samarasimha offered 4000 villages to Sundaraka (11th tale) and
king of Pūrņapathaka offered 1000 villages to Ratnadatta (8th tale).

Though the king was thus the most important limb of the state
it is surprising to note that his political or military achievements
had very little effect on the lives of the people. The wars against
other kingdoms were taken to be the normal occupation of the war-
rior class and were not considered worthy of literary record. This
would explain why a work like the SMK written by a king like
Bhoja, ever engaged in military exploits and political alliances, re-
mains completely silent on such activities.
The City and its Social Set-up
The city was the most important centre of all activities. A
picture of the cities of medieval India preserved in literature em-
phasises a highly rich and pompous way of living. All the wealth
of the State was concentrated there.
As stated above, the story of SMK is laid in the city of Dhārā,
the capital of the Paramāra rulers. The picturesque description of
Dhärā with its wealth of details throw interesting light on some
of the important features of the city and its planning which was as
important in those days as it is today. Bhoja in his Samarāngana-
sūtradhāra devotes a whole chapter to town-planning. 19 The details
of the layout of the city and life therein are dealt with here in order
to bring into bolder relief the continuity of our cultural traditions,
whose roots can be traced as far back as Kautilya's times.
The city (puri, nagarī) had an outer wail (prākāra).20 It was
whitewashed; for it is described as being white as snow. It was
circular in form and was studded with various precious stones. On
it were watch-towers (attālaka),21 with high decorative indentation
(uttunga kapiśirşaka).22 The city wall had four gateways (pratoli) 23
20.
While on the other hand Ghuda was unnecessarily harassed, put in prison
and fined by king Vajramukuța. King Samarasimha first eagerly sent his men
to punish Ratnadatta and in the last tale we read that the queen's nose and
ears were cut off and she was put in prison and Müladeva's wife and the
merchant were deported by the king.

are mentioned in the SS, so it has been quoted often.

Präkrit it is called Kausīsaga. SS. gives its measure in height to be an hand.

with broad and heavy doors (vitataghanakapāța). There was a mvat
(parikhā) encircling the entire city wall. In the city there were
main roads and streets (rathyā) lined with shops (vipaņi) and pala-
tial mansions (prāsāda), stuccoed (saudha) and lavishly decorated
with various precious stones and gold. The residential quarters
were variously called prāsāda, bhavana, gļhaka, veśma and sanni-
veśa-sthāna.
Besides the extensive outskirts of the buildings (bhavanopasal-
yāni) the city had innumerable public parks (upavana, udyāna,
pramadavana), artificial hills (krīdā-saila), lakes (saras, tadūgu),
wells and tanks (vāpī, dirghikā, puskariņi) and public baths (dhiiru-

an abundance in the city that it appeared to be प्रासादमयमिव भुवनतलं केवलं,

77951 (p. 2) Prāsādas were palatial mansions. They were very
high and were white-washed as the term 'saudha' signifies.21 But
they are variously designed as 'kanaka-saudha', 'sphatika-vesma',
'marakata-maņi-prāsāda’ etc. probably because of the predominance
of the decorative materials.
. Some of the architectural details are very well brought out in
the descriptions. The salient features are pinnacles of gold (kanaka-
śikhara) or of precious stones.25 The candraśālās were the special
apartments on the terraces from which the moonrise was observed.20
These rooms were white-washed and the walls and ceiling were de-
corated with paintings, and were studded with sapphires.
The buildings had several storeys (tala) besides the terraces
(utsanga). Utsanga is explained as any horizontal area or level as
of a roof of a house. The floors were studded with crystals and were
resorted to by the people in the summer. The roof was sloping and
the porjecting eaves (valabhikā) had water channels made of moon.
stones at the end of the ridges (valabhikā-candramani-pranāli). The
valabhikā was also a small projecting balcony, sometimes called
vadabhī, and was studded with emeralds (garutmata-valabhikā) or
made of ivory (danta-vadabhī). Niryūhas are generally explained
as dove-cotes. Besides these there were particular projections in
the houses at certain heights on which rows of swans or pigeons
were carved. These were called hansa-pālis and kapota-pālis. The
walls of the mansions were whitewashed on the outside, but decorat-
ed within with pictures and precious stones. The floorings had

The Candraśālās were apartments in the terraces, white and decorated with
paintings. Because of the paintings these apartments were also called' Citra-
śālās. They were reserved for the newly weds. Even now in Rājasthān there
are similar apartments and they are called Cittasõrīs.

crystals, sapphires, rubies, corals and the like studded in gold and
other minerals. On the grounds were built pavilions (vedikā) with
raised seats (vițańka). These also were decorated with precious
stones. The courtyards (prāngaña) and arches (torana)27 were
necessary features of the buildings. Stair-cases (sopāna) and win-
dows (vātāyana) were made of crystals. Slightly different from the
windows were the 'gavākşas', windows with fretwork in stone. In
the royal palaces were special audience halls (āsthāna) and pleasure
pavilion (krīdā-mandapa) both inside and outside. 'Sayanāgāra' was
the bedroom and 'Apavaraka' was another name for a room.
The parks (udyānas) had, of course, their natural beauty, but
they were planned and well-provided with artificial lakes, tanks,
lotus-ponds and hillocks. The secanakutīs were kept cool with
water sprinkled from leather bags; and they were resorted to by
the pleasure loving couples to escape the heat of the summer.
The most interesting feature was the yantra-dhārā-gļha which
was an ideal resort during the summer season. It is an old feature
of the cities, for we find the mention and description of the same
in the Kādamabarī,28 the Yaśastilaka-campū,29 the Tilakamañjari30
and many other works. The construction of the yantra-dhārā-grhu.
was very elaborate, and therefore the kings alone could afford them.31
At the very outset of this work we read that the king was seated
in the dhārā-grha. But the description of the city includes another
yantra-dhārā-grha, which was accessible to the people of the city.
The purpose of the dhārā-grha was to seek refuge from the heat
of the summer days. It was made of dark coloured stones to de-
flect the heat and keep the inside cool. Various pavilions and bal-
conies were provided within the house. Pillars, pillartops and carved
dolls on them (paţtaśālabhañjikā) adorned the chambers. On the top
of the pillars (stambhaśīrşaka) were small statues which looked as
if they bore the burden of the whole roof. They were called bhāra-
putrakas, and their reflections in the pillars multiplied their number.
The dhārā-grha was kept very cool as if it was made of camphor,
snow or bits of the moon.

SRNGARAMAÑJARIKATHA
In the courtyards of the dhārā-grha were tanks and lotus ponds
in which at some places mechanical tortoises swam up and down, at
another, mechanical families of cranes were cheated by the swim-
ming mechanical fishes, and at other places the mechanical crocodiles
frightened the dolls fashioned as mermaids.
Inside the dhārā-grha were many mechanical contrivances.
Dolls of various sizes and shapes danced and played music. Mechani-
cal cranes, bees and cakravākas moved up and down like living ones.
Water flowed from all possible slits and holes--the eyes of the wing-
ed crocodiles, the mouth of the pea-hen, hair, palms, nails and
breasts of dolls, mouths of monkeys climbing up an artificial tree,
from the ground underneath, walls, ceiling, lotuses, pillars and pillar-
tops. On the whole it created the illusion of pleasant rainy days
within, when as a matter of fact the sun blazed fiercely without. It
was natural therefore that the whole populace was bewitched by
the splendour of such a yantra-dhārā-grha:
इदं नानाकारं कुलभवनमाद्यं रतिपते-
निवासश्चित्राणामनकरणमेकं जलमचाम् ।
पयःपातीष्मे रविकरपरीतापशमनं
न केषामत्यर्थं भवति नयनानन्दजननम् ।।*
The picture of the city bespeaks the prosperity and grandeur
of the times. With the increase of material prosperity the lives of
the people flowed easy and smooth. There was ample time, oppor-
tunity and means to indulge in every interest and temptation that
life offered. If this text were taken to portray a faithful picture of
its times, it offers us a glimpse of the pattern of the social life in
general. The picture, it must be confessed, is hardly flattering or
respectable.
The mosaic of the population was made up of Brāhmaṇas,
Kşatriyas, Vaiśyas, Kāyasthas and men of other professions. But
the way of life of the individuals described in the text indicates
nothing high or noble about them. It may be wrong to infer that
the whole social fabric was corrupt, that the air was thick with
fraud, greed and slickness, and that society was suffocated with the
stench of lust; but it cannot be denied that at least partially it was
so, and even the rich and the respectable descended to low and
vulgar levels.
The social arrangement demanded that the populace should be
distributed among different localities according to their varnas and
professions. The locality of the Brāhmaṇas made the entire city
look as if it was a world of Brāhmaṇas; for at places rows of śrotri-
yas moved up and down engaged continuously in various rituals. At
some places the recitations of the khilas and nigamas could be heard.

and at others discourses were held on the śrutis, smrtis, vyākarana-
śāstra, purānas and itihāsas.
The Brāhmaṇas were rich and learned. The mention of the
riches of the Brāhmaṇas reminds us of the verse:
मुक्ताः केलिविसूत्रहारगलिताः संमार्जनीभिर्हताः
प्रातः प्राङगणमोम्नि मन्थरचलाबालाङिघलाक्षारुणाः ।
दूरादाडिमबीजशङिकतधियः कर्षन्ति केलीशुकाः
यद्विद्वद्भवनेषु भोजनृपतेस्तत्त्यागलीलायितम् ।।
The Brāhmaṇas followed the path laid down by the śruti and
the smrti. (श्रुतिस्मृत्युदितेन वर्मना संचरमाणस्य etc.).
Boys were invested with the sacred thread and initiated into
studies at a young age. By the time he was sixteen he complet-
ed his studies. (POT 7779quia faf1acftafsats 3ptautFT: )
and entered life with full ®zest. The bulk of the Brāhmaṇas may
have followed their ancestral occupation of study and rituals and
received the titles of distinction; but all spheres of activity were
open to them. We hear of the Brāhmaṇa Vişnudatta, who became
a king, and Mädhava who returned from Simhaladvipa after doing
good business.
The kings, princes, feudatories and courtiers came from the
Kşatriyas. They were rich, charitable, pleasure-loving and valo-
rous. The position of the king has already been described above."
The third important class was that of the Vaiśyas, the mer-
chants. The sons of merchants were well up in all arts and sciences,
like gaja-śāstra, aśva-vidyā, vanik-kalā, dyūta-rahasya, vaisikopani-
şad, citra, patracchedya and pusta-kalā. For them it was not obliga-
tory to join their father's business. (Cf. Ratnadatta's attitude).
The city's wealth and splendour depended upon the wealth of the
merchants, and therefore they were an important class of people.
Besides these three classes, the Kāyasthas are mentioned.
According to the Varņa-dharma they form an intermediate caste.
But prior to the epoch depicted in this work, the Kayasthas were in
the administrative services of the kings. They formed a class of
government officers. In the Narmamālā Kșemendra devotes a whole
chapter to the Kāyasthas, where the first verse eulogises them rather
sarcastically thus:
येनेदं स्वेच्छया सर्व मायया मोहितं जगत् ।
स जयत्यजितः श्रीमान्कायस्थः परमेश्वरः ।।
The references to Kāyasthas are generally full of scorn and deroga-

tellers (sakunika) and persons proficient in magic (indrajālika-vidyr)
and mesmerism (mohana-vidyā).
Of men following other professions we hear of the oilman
(tailika) doing his hereditary work and prospering in it. The medi-
cine man (vaidya), agriculturist (karşakajana), smith (lohakāra),
weaver (tantuvāya), keeper of the gambling house (sabhika). The
slaughter house (sünā) is mentioned, along with the barbar (näpita)
and the hunter (vyādha).
The picture of the countryside is roseate and rich. Agricultural
prosperity is evident in the descriptions of the emerald-like green
rice-fields protected by the kalamagopikās, the barely fields and
forests of sugarcane. The return of the cattle in the evenings from
the rich pasture lands was inferred from the tinkling of the bells.
Wood for fuel was available in plenty from the forests.
Outside the cities, in these simple surrounding dwelt the vil-
lagers (Kārvațas) and along the seacoasts the sea-faring men (Veli-
kūlas). The forests were full of the Sabaras. An interesting ethno.
logical description of the Sabaras is given thus at one place. They
were well-built and dark in colour. They had snub noses, high cheek-
bones, pointed chins and small ears. Their eyes were red-shot and
wide open and their eyebrows were knitted. With curly hair, with
sparsely growing beards, with peacocks' feathers tied to their hair,
with bows and arrows in hand, blowing horns and marching in
groups they frightened away not only the travellers but also the
wild beasts.
The Kirātas, the Barbaras and the Bhillas also had their resi-
dences (pallīs) in the forests, which could be marked even from a
distance during the mornings due to the sweet songs of the women-
folk while pounding barley and rice at their doors.
These are the divisions of classes and professions. But the mem-
bers of respectable classes referred to in the text are only the men
about the town (nāgaraka) who led easy-going and sophisticated
lives, basking in luxury. Vātsyāyana has devoted a whole chapter to
the description of the Nāgaraka's life and we have a contemporanc-
ous literary record to the effect that it was a favourite pastime of
such men to indulge in the science of Erotics day and night.
For company, they had hangers-on like the Vițas, 34 Dhūrtas,
Dindikas and the Şingas who were ever ready to help them in their

amorous adventures. But the company most desired by them was
that of the hetaira. In order to be worthy of their interests and
accomplishments the hetaria also had to be educated. And gradu-
ally, as the respectable members of society took more and more in-
terests in them their position and status improved considerably and
they came to be regarded as the most advanced, cultured and wel.
come members of society.35
The SMK is concerned mainly with this important section of
society.
These women are to be distinguished on the one hand from
the gay and beautiful ladies of the town, and on the other from the
ordinary veśyās or prostitutes, the common women. About the for-
mer, we come to know, from stray references, only this that they
were dressed and adorned in the fashions of the day; their hair
was long and was braided or knotted and was always decorated with
seasonal flowers. Tādanka, danta-patra and kundala were their
ear-ornaments; be-jewelled necklaces and flower garlands adorned
their necks; valaya, karikara and keyūra were their armlets, and
their feet constantly resounded with the tinkling of the nūpuras.
Fragrant sandal, camphor, kumkum and rodhra pollen were applied
to their bosoms, and their palms and feet were painted with the alak-
taka dye. Besides the accomplishment of music (sangīta) or taurya-
trikamthe triple harmony of singing, dancing and instrumental
music-we hear of no other accomplishment of theirs. This is be-
cause the whole work is devoted to the lives of courtesans.
The ganikā is enumerated along with the veśyā, but there is
a vast difference between the two. A few technical points may be
noted here. The Kāmasūtra mentions nine types of common women,
namely, kumbhadāsī, paricărikā, kulaţā, svairiņā, națī, silpukārikā,
prakāśavinaștā, rūpājīvā and the gaņikā.36 Bharata calls her
bähyā,37 dhanikā, sādhāraṇī,38 and Rudrața sumūnyā.39 Bhoja also
calls the common woman sāmānyā, and further gives three divisions:
ganikā, rīpājīvā and valāsini. The SMK uses the words veśyā,
35. From this it is not proper to infer that other women in society were absolutely
ignorant and unaccomplished as is done in the following remark of Dubois
"The courtesans are the only women in India who enjoy the privilege of learn-
ing to read, to dance, to sing' (Hindu manners, customs and ceremonies, p. 586).

dārikā, sādhāraņē, gaṇikā, vesayuvatī—all of them referring to the
ganikā.
The position of the courtesan in society was superior to the other
common women because she was like the eraipa of Athens and the
hetera of Greece,--the privileged woman in society who was the
companion of kings and wealthy merchant-princes.
It is difficult to trace the historical origin of the institution of
courtesans in India as is done with regard to the Erapi4 I or the
Geisha Guild.42 But it seems to have been gradually developed.
As far back as the time of Kautilya the institution of courtesan was
fairly established. The Arthaśāstra has a whole chapter dealing
with the Superintendence of the gaạikās. Ganikī was not necessarily
hereditary,43 which reminds us of the Geisha guilds of Japan of the
present day.
The Arthaśāstra tells us that the profession of gaạikā was not
necessarily hereditary,44 and the gaạikās were trained entertainers,
holding highly paid posts in the king's court. They were also em-
ployed in the temples.45 A courtesan was not a free woman, but
was under strict official control, ever liable to suffer penalty for
breach of regulations. The registration and regulation of the gari-
kās that we read about in the Arthaśāstra was more for the safety
of the state than for any other reason. And it was better than the
Roman tradition where registration and the minor regulations such
as the dyeing of hair and other disabilities were enforced for separat.
ing the gaạikās for public reprobation and penalizing them for their
profession. 46
Bhoja describes the gaạikā as: FITTI:gfrafaz. 47 Hemacandra

says: कलाप्रागल्भ्यधौाभ्यां गणयति कलयति गणिका 48 Vātsyāyana mentions
the sixty-four anga-vidyās and says:
आभिरभ्युछिता वेश्या शीलरूपगुणान्विता।
लभते गणिकाशब्दं स्थानं च जनसंसदि ।।
पूजिता सा सदा राज्ञा गणवदभिश्च संस्तुता।
प्रार्थनीयाऽभिगम्या च लक्ष्यभूता च जायते ।।
So we know for certain that the gaņikä was respected for her
knowledge of the different arts. Not only that but girls of res-
pectable families and young men were sent to her to be instructed
in some of the arts. Of the sixty four arts mentioned by Vātsyā-
yana, music, painting, dancing, etc. are purely aesthetic.
Višeşakacchedyam, pușpăstaraṇam and the like for the purpose of
increasing one's personal charms; śayanāracanam, Bhūşanayojanam
are for knowing the part of service; prahelikā, pratimālā, durvącaka-
yoga are entertaining games, while pustakavācana and kāvya-sama-
syā-pürana and the like are purely intellectual pursuits.
With all these personal charms and accomplishments it is not
surprising that the ganikā came to be regarded as a respectable and
important member of the community. The description of our nāyikā,
Śrngāramañjari, is that of a perfect ganikā of the first order. Her
beauty was unparalled, her graces were befitting, her dresses and
adornments were choice and befitting, and her language and be.
haviour were polished and decorous. In dancing and music she
excelled others and her intelectual development made her a worthy
companion of the most learned.
Vātsyāyana speaks of the mastery of the gaạikā in sixty-four
arts; but śrngāramañjari was adept in 347779:"fait, both kinds
of sixty-four arts. The first group we have already referred to;
the other refers to the sixty-four sāmprayogika arts which Vātsyā-
yana mentions in the second book of the Kāmasutra. It indicates
that Śưngāramañjari was adept in the science of erotics. She was
bold in questions and answers, eloquent in speech, wellread in
treatises on different subjects and expert at understanding and com-
posing poetry. Possessing unparalled beauty, knowledge and good
fortune, she was the favourite of the king and it was not surprising
that the Brāhmaṇas, Kșatriyas, Vaiśyas and Kāyasthas all waited at
her doors with gifts to offer. With all the wealth and power of the
kingdom at her feet it was easy for her to live in great pomp and
splendour. 50

ŚRNGĀRAMAÑJARIKATHA
Her description reminds us of the influential French and Eng-
lish mistresses like Madame Du Barry, Nivon, Jane Shore and Nell
Gwyn whose salons attracted powerful kings and statesmen of
Europe of the day; and who practically ruled their countries. 5 1
But Śộngāramañjarī specially reminds us of Aspasia who was loved
by great men like Alcibiades and Socrates, and who finally married
Pericles. She was, according to Plato, an accomplished rhetorician
and the real composer of the funeral oration of Pericles, and accord-
ing to Plutarch, was courted by many statesmen and philosophers
of Greece.62
In the SMK we do not read of the State control of the houses
of gaạikās. But nevertheless every gaạikā's household was con-
trolled by a strict officer in the form of the 'mother' or the Kuttani.
She was an eye-sore to the men who came to the courtesan and
they swore: TO JET HET EAT OUT THAT I
विश्वकण्टकतां याता निहता कि न कुटटनी ।
It was but natural that the gaņikās were sometimes sincerely loved
and that they came to cherish sincere love for one man or another.
But their social position was such that little scope was given to
them to cherish true love. Some of them understood their position
all right and strictly followed the rules laid down for them. They
punctiliously kept watch over their own interests and lived success-
fully. Some of them practised fraud, for, greed never left them.
They were punished by the king or the individuals who suffered at
their hands. While some of the gaạikās valued their respectable
positions and did not stoop to cheating or inviting punishment, nor
did they value wealth more than virtue or fleeting fancy more than
constant love.
But with regard to these last mentioned, the 'mothers' were
always worried. As guardians of the gaạikās it was their duty to
see that the courtesans never deviated from their paths. It was
heart-breaking for them to see that the energy spent in training the
courtesans was all lost by her resolute will to be faithful to one
person. In the Dāśakumāracarita we read how Kāmamañjari's
mother complains to the sage in the following words: “Sir, this
daughter of mine would make it appear that I am to blame, but
e to cherisks such that
51. Wallace, op. cit, mentions a Geisha, Ohana San, who though living then had
become a legendary person. She was the mistress of the late Prince Saionji,
last of the Elder Statesman and intimate advisor of Hirohoto. At the time of
the Versailles Peace Conference, Prince Saionji took her to Paris, and Woodrow
Wilson, charmed by her, presented her with a pearl necklace. There was con-
siderable embarrassment later when President Wilson learnt the young lady's
status. Till 1945 (when the article was written) she was living and was then
the abbess of a nunnery near Tokyo.

indeed, I have done my duty, and have carefully prepared her for
the profession for which from birth she was intended. From the
earliest childhood I have bestowed the greatest care upon her, doing
everything in my power to promote her health and beauty. As
soon as she was old enough I had her carefully instructed in the
arts of dancing etc. ....... I did many other things to promote
her success and to secure for her liberal renumeration; yet after all
the time, trouble and money which I have spent upon her, just when
I was beginning to reap the fruit of my labours, the ungrateful girl
has fallen in love with a stranger,"
This then was the one thing that the 'mother' constantly dreaded
-- the rise of sincere love in a courtesan. The fear was only natural,
as faithfulness to one individual would spell ruin in her profession.
A wise 'mother' had always to be on guard and instruct the courtesan
about the dangers of the different temptations that her life offered.
It was her duty as a courtesan not to forget her true profession.
It is with such a purpose in view that in the present work the
wise and experienced Vişamaśīlā gives instructions to the fair and
fortunate Śrngāramanjarī. She enumerates the maxims that a
courtesan has to follow to escape falling into the trap of a cheat
or a rogue. The purport of her entire teaching is that a courtesan
should be wise and discriminating and not get entangled in the bonds
of affection. By doing so she fulfills her duties and obligations to-
wards society in which she enjoys a high position.
This class of courtesans constituted an important section of
society which influenced a considerable number of people. Their
53. Deśopadesa, p. 11, vs. 10.
54. Later rhetoricians have raised a controversy whether the srigara-love-
involved in garika's case is true or not. And when it is not true whether it
should be called srngāra or sugārābhāsa. Bharata (23, 18-26) mentions three
types of courtesans: madanătură (one craving company), raktă (attached) and
viraktā (one who is averse). Here raktā is the one of true love. Vâtsyāyana
(in the sixth book, mentions two goals of her life, namely, natural love and
artificial love, (VI, 1, 1, 2) and the former he calls ekacāriņā. (VI, 2, 1-2). In
the Sriigăratilaka, Rudrața states: (I, 64, 65)
शङगाराभास एव स्याद्यदि ता रागजिताः। . . तस्मात्तासामपि क्वापि रागः स्यात् ।।
So he accepts her true love, without which hers will be a case of rasābhūsa
only; Bhoja does not discuss the point in his works, but the SMK has stories
of true love, and one of the lessons that Vişamaśīlā teaches is that the courtesan
should never be sincere in her love. Viśvanātha after mentioning that a com-

houses afforded endless pleasures and amusement to rich citizens.
But we also hear of a complement of other institutions, which afford-
ed pleasure and entertainment like the glambing house (ļiņțū),
theatre (rangaśālā), pleasure houses ! krīdāgāra, krīdābhavana) and
temples (devālaya, devagſha, devāyatana). The love for outdoor
life took the citizens out to the parks (udyāna), swimming (jala-
majjana), hunting (mşgayā), playing balls (kanduka-krīdā), swing-
ing (dolāndolana) and dancing (nrtya, nātya).
Religious festivals were also enjoyed with gusto. We have re.
ference to the yātrā-mahotsava of Madana, the worship of the Sun
of Vijayasaptami, the worship of the Goddesses Ašāpură and Vin:
dhyavāsini, and the god Ganapati who helps to attin the desired
objectives of life. Mahākālanātha who was presiding deity of
Ujjayini, and was therefore worshipped with great fervour. There
is an uncomplimentary reference to the pāśupata sect (hīnasattva-
pāsu pata-pākhanda, which later on was followed by the Paramāras
of Mālwā.55
Among beliefs, we read only of the pigeon being considered
unfortunate when it stays in the house. The units of currency
mentioned are dramma and pala. Gold coins are usually mentioned
as pieces of gold.
From this short review of the times based on information
contained in the SMK it can be said that during Bhoja's rule civili-
zation in Mālwā had risen to a magnificent pitch. Our appreciation
of Bhoja for having portrayed a faithful picture of one of the most
glorious periods of medieval Indian History is heightened when
we take into consideration that he worked and stood for all that
was glorious in Hindu Culture.
55. An inscription of the reign of Kumārapāla, dated 1169 A.D. throws light on the
distinguished Pāśupata teacher Bhāvabrhaspati. He left Vārānasi and came to
Dhārā and the Paramāra kings became his disciples. Vide, A collection of
Prakrt and Sanskrit Inscriptions, published by the Bhavnagar Archaeological
Department, p. 186; See also Ganguly, op. cit, p. 249.
56. We come across a similar belief in Somadeva's Yaśastilakaccampū, see Handiqui,
op. cit, p. 407.

THE SRNGĀRAMAÑJARIKATHA
OF
ŚRI BHOJADEVA
(TRANSLATION)
PREFACE
(1) Once upon a time, when springtime was nearly at an end;
when the bowers of the Mādhavi creeper had its clusters fully deve-
loped with the blooming flowers; when on the bunches of mango
blossoms small fruits had thinly sprouted; when the clusters of
Madhūka flowers, which steal the beauty of the cheeks of the Hūna
ladies, had almost fallen down; when the Pāțala flowers, which re-
semble the colour of the lips of the women of Lāța which are kissed
(lit. drunk in) by their lovers, had fully bloomed; when the Malaya
breeze brought about inactivity in the dull; when the buds of the
Mallikā manifested sparsely like the smiles of the Glory of Sum-
mer outgrowing her childhood; when the anxiousness of the wan-
ton women for swinging had lessened (lit. had resorted to lan-
guor) and their desire for the pleasure of water-sport had increased
(lit. had taken resort to desirableness); when the spread of perspi-
ration which is non-prickly, bristled on the breasts of the lotus-eyed
ladies due to the collection of formed drops; when the rays of the
Sun, which had not bleached the greenness of fresh grass, were
slowly attaining maturity; when the beginning of Summer was
gradually setting in, MAHĀRĀJĀDHIRĀJA PARAMEŚVARA
ŚRI BHOJADEVA, who, in the pleasure garden, was seated on the
central seat of the dhārāgļha which was studded with moonstones,
and whose lotus-feet were worshipped by some learned men, a few
relations, friends and kings, was courteously requested thus:---
"Though you are our ruler yet because of the people you are
a good kinsman (SUBANDHU), you are the splendour of Śrī (SRI-
BHASA), you are rich in virtues (GUŅĀDHYA) and you have sung
the glory of Gods (PRAŠASTAGĪRVĀŅA). Therefore, as our
minds are deeply desirous, for our delight and knowledge, please
tell us a new story.”
Being thus told, (he) smilingly said, “Let it be so, but a story
that is narrated bears beauty only when it commences with the
description of the town and the like. And there is no city more
distinguished than this one, therefore, this (city) alone will have
to be described first. And because of the circumstance of my be.
ing its ruler I will have to speak about myself which is indeed im-
proper."




Page 213****************************************************************************************
ŠĶNGĀRAMANJARIKATHA
Then, by them who had thus heard their king's words, he was
again spoken to-—"Sire knows that we are not like that. It has
been said by all writers on poetics that, 'there is no blame in speak-
ing of one's own merits if (one) records only facts', thus sages like
VÄLMIKI, PARĀŚARA, and VYĀSA, and poets like GUŅĀDHYA,
BHASA, BHAVABHŪTI and BĀŅA have made known their
merits. The narration of virtues one does not possess is a fault,
but not the narration of one's true merits."
Thus being addressed (by them), (he) spoke to them:--"You
are not ignorant; therefore if this (narration) seems uncensurable
to you, then I shall tell you. Listen (2);-
DESCRIPTION OF DHARA
Here is a city named Dhārā, the one ornament of the whole
world, which has by its own wondrous splendour put aside the
glory of the city of the gods; which as it were laughs at the single
disc of the moon by thousands of moons in the form of the faces of
the city dames moving every night in the candraśālās of the high
mansions; which, by the mass of the rays arising from the pure
crystal mansions brightening the sky and the network of flashing
rays issuing forth from the emerald palaces, brings about a friend-
ship of sale and exchange between the naturally opposite darkness
and moonlight; which, on every mansion removes as it were the
perspiration of the horses of the sun whose bodies are tired due to
the fatigue caused by traversing the vast expanse of the sky, by
fanning with the fringes of the banners waving in the wind; which
is, as it were, the life of the earth; the essence as it were of the
world; the summum bonum as it were of the Universe; the place
of trust as it were of all wealth; the residence as it were of Grace;
the ornament as it were of the world; the resort as it were of the
three goals of life (viz. dharma, artha and kāma); the house of
creation of the naturally charming women; the chief resort as it
were of loveliness, and the stream of nectar to the eyes of all the
people.
Wherein, the spreading mass of white lustre of the crystal man-
sions makes the circle of directions white and blissfully pleasant;
wherein, every night, darkness is multiplied by the emerald floors, is
split up by the floorings of the crystal palaces, is reduced to pieces by

of the moon reflected in the floorings made of red precious stones
gives rise to the illusion of a grove of water-lilies to the fascinated
womenfolk,
(The city) which derides as it were even in the three worlds
all the old residences of the town by its continuously flashing lustre
of pure crystalline turrets; which (city) to a man who looks
longingly at it seems to be a world of palaces only, the Creator's
new creation of mansions only, an earth possessed of tanks only, a
circle of directions made of gardens only and the vault of the sky
made of banners only. Wherein it seemed that every night the rays
of the moon merged in the crystal floorings, were drunk in by the
courtyards studded with emeralds, surpassed the evening clouds (as
they were reflected) in the middle of the raised seats of the pavilions
of the houses made of red jewels, possessed the lustre of the deer
in the crystal windows darkened by the smoke of the Kālāguru in-
cense, and melted in the moonstone channel on the eaves. Where-
in, everyday, the rays of the sun appeared, like offshoots on the
golden pinnacles, like stems on the golden staffs of the banners, like
leaves on the flashy ruby mansions, like flowers on the rows of the
golden swans inlaid with precious red stones, and like fruits on the
balls on the golden tops of the palaces made of shining gold; (3) which
(rays) falling on the crystal walls and flashing back become as it
were moonlight (rays) even during the day; which being deflected
from the ruby floors after coming in contact with it, become, as it
were land-lotuses; which falling on the raised seats of the pavilions
made of pure pearls and reflecting back become as it were white
lotuses; which falling on the candraśālās made of sapphires become
as it were blue lotuses; which possess, as it were, the red lustre of
the early sun on the floors of the pleasure houses made of corals;
which shine refulgently, after reflecting on the golden tops of the
mansions; which cool down as it were on the turrets made of eme-
ralds; which become covered as it were by the columns of smoke
of Kālāguru; and which, due to the intermingling of the mass of
rays of the other colourful jewels on the mansions give rise to thou-
sands of rain-bows on all sides for the protection of the city.
Where, every night, the moon is disturbed in his movement
when the deer stops moving on hearing the notes of music together
with the jingling of the jewelled bangles of the women resorting to
the terraces of the high buildings. Where the deer in the form of
the spot suffers the never-experienced pain of being tied by the
ropes in the form of the rays issuing forth from the jewelled arm-
lets on the unsteady hands which are raised in dancing, of these
very women. Where the grandeur of the monsoon is always pre-
sent, because the sky is darkened by the mass of dense smoke is-
suing from the fire of hundreds of sacrifices in which oblations are

the illusion of water-lotuses even on ground due to the crystal floors
reddened by the alaktaka-dye on the feet of the women intoxicated

some places becomes a world of Madana, enthusing friends in
getting ornaments for the doe-eyed ones .... anxious to go to their
lovers; which at places becomes the nether regions with the lovers
«hooded serpents» enjoying pleasures; and which at places becomes
heaven with the winds following light «the Maruts following the
Sun».
Where (in the city) the body of the towns-folk, skillful in all
transactions, is compassionate like the storm «which holds dust in
it»; which is free from miseries like the ocean «which dispels the
heat of the sun»; which is free from all horrors like Rāvana «whose
residence was abandoned by Vibhişaņa»; which had not widowers
like the newmoon day «which is without the moon or the sun»;
which has decked itself with resplendent gold like spring «which is
adorned with the pleasing Kāñcana trees; which has obtained
union with pure ones like summer «which has heat»; which
has not seen heavy taxation like the monsoon «when the hot-rayed
one, the sun, is not seen»; which has a longing for clean clothes like
the autumn «when the sky is free from clouds»; which is full of
greatness like the old season «when snow is equally spread»; which
is always free from anxiety like the winter «when there is no heat
of the sun»; which though Mākanda «the root of prosperity», is Asoka
«free from sorrow»; which though Sarala «straight-forward» is
Arișța «secure»; which though Sumitrānandana «giving joy to good

ready with bows as if for the protection of the city; which has an
incurvature like the rainbow; which has four gateways decorated
with massive gates which are always crowded with thousands of
peoples as if the directions had come there out of curiosity to see
the city.
Which is surrounded by a moat, in which at places the lotuses
were ever kept open by the pairs of Cakravākas constantly together
on account of the continuous brightness of the day created by the
spreading of the rays of the refulgent topaz embedded on the sides
of the high copings; in which, at some places, the night lotuses were
forever blooming because of the illusion of night created by the
dense darkness of the collection of rays of the emeralds set in the
turrets; whose water appeared at some places to be reddened
by the kumkum applied to the pot-like breasts of the ladies of the
town, on account of its waters being tinged with the rays issuing
from the watch towers made of rubies; and which at some places,
because of the reflection of the white circular crystal wall within
it, looked as if it was Śesa who had come out to see the city out of
curiosity.
In which (city) there are lakes, with their waters tinged with
the pollen of the open Kamala, Kumuda, Kalhāra and Indivara;
which are very pure like the minds of the good people; which are
difficult to be measured like the minds of the wicked; which are
attractive with the sweet humming of the bees hovering over up-
right white lotuses; which are fragrant with the sandal-paste washed
away from the pot-like breasts of the wanton women of the city
sporting in them; whose border regions are darkened by the rows
of bees attracted by the fragrance of the Saugandhika flowers;
which seemed to be presided over by the maidens of the netherland
come out for water sport, on account of the reflection in the crystal
slabs of the women of the city who have come for their bath; where
every night, the mates of the Cakravākas, languid due to love, look
with great longing at their own reflections thinking them to be their
lovers; in which, it seemed, due to the fear of the sun, darkness, be-
coming very small, had taken resort, in the form of bees hidden in
the inmost cups of the closed night lotuses; on whose banks resorted
moonlight as it were, in the form of rows of geese, possessing the
lustre of white lotuses, seating in the shades of the leaves of the
land lotuses fearing the oppression of the rays of the sun; which are
resorted to by the flocks of the foolish cranes, who being greedy to
devour the Šaphara fish seen in the very clear deep waters, frequent-

(5) In the (city) where there are many enchanting abodes like
the pleasure tanks and the Viravilāsodyāna and others, there is a
mechanical fountain house which fascinates the minds of the citizens;
which (fountain house) because of the reflection of the trees in its
walls made of pure precious stones (standing) in the middle of
Nandanavana looks as if it has allowed in, and thus protected the
very delicate garden trees which have sought refuge due to the fear
of the sun; which, out of fear of insulting the great, welcomes the
people entering with coolness produced by the fall of thousands of
streams spreading all round; (6) which as it were forms masses of
clouds by the radiant lustre of the emeralds (set) in the base of the
pinnacle, for warding off, even from a distance, the heat of the sun
which torments the whole world; which having cut asunder keeps
outside under the guise of the leaves of the forest as it were, the fire
of agony of the people entering, who are reflected in both the sides of
the doors made of dark coloured precious stones; which in the three
worlds mocks as it were the creation of the Ancient Creator by the
production of the moving mechanical dolls; which is like the palace
of Varuņa; like the place of assignation of winter; like the home of
auspiciousness of the gods of the regions of the Himālayas; like the
place of defeat for the summer's heat; like the pleasure-home of the
fish-bannered God; like the store-house of sport of the ocean of love;
like the place of origin of the rains; like the mansion of creation of
the inventions; like the summum bonum of loveliness; like the
jewelled mirror of skilfulness; and like the outhouse of pleasures.

its scented waters (seems) as if created by the perfume of the
Bakula flowers, made with powder of the Kakkola fruits, whose
surrounding area is as if made by the clove-flowers, and whose
streams are as of the juice of Elāphala; which exhibits, as it were,
the watery creation of the Creator by thousands of streams flowing
everywhere; which is unattainable by the rays of the sun; which
admits not misery; which cannot be overpowered by the antidotes
of the separated; which cannot be looked at by the fire of separation
of the separated lady-lovers; which is the place for cooling even
cold; the habitation of happiness even of happiness; and charm even
of charm; which seems to sprinkle in the directions, camphor pow-
der due to the spraying of the drops of thousands of streams with
its waves rising, striking and breaking in all directions, which seems
to strew flakes of snow like moonlight, because of the oozing of the
mechanical water dolls made of moonstone; which pours forth
streams of sandal paste as it were, as the water mixed with the rays
of the white jewels; which has hundreds of flowing streams look-

the full bloomed lotuses; which though made of various precious
stones looks as if made of one jewel because the pillars, the tops of
the pillars and the human figures carved on the tops of the pillars

looks natural.

the thirsty garden cakorakas even during day-time due to the illu-
sion of its being moonlight, with their beaks open and their minds

of thousands of streams of water, with the splendour of clouds
formed by the network of rays uprising from the emerald pillars, and
with the beauty of lightening produced by the intermittently flash-
ing rays of rubies; where in the courtyard-tanks and ponds at some

fish coming in and out; at other (7) the mechanical young ones of tor-

experts by the triple symphony of song, dance and instrumental
music displayed by the mechanical dolls; which laughs under the
guise of the blooming white lotuses carved on the walls at the clever
onlookers whose minds are dazzled on seeing the curious mechanical
contrivances; and, which has on all sides the rivers for pleasure-
sports, with their banks muddy with the musk of deer, with the
sand in the form of camphor powder, with waters fragrant with pure
sandal, and with lotus groves in the form of the rays of rubies mix-
ed with those of emeralds.
In the (city) were forests, which due to the constant presence
of dense darkness and excessive light were as if presided over by
innumerable rays of ihe sun and darkness; which (forests) were
decorated with trees which because of the continuous sprouting
of leaves looked as if it was their love that had manifested on
seeing the womenfolk of the town; which announced as it were
the royal proclamation of victory of the fish-bannered god under
the pretext of the sweet humming of the bees; and where, because,
the citywomen were moving here and there for collecting flowers,
it appeared that the sylvan deities were always in vicinity.
Having said this, when the mechanical doll was addressed thus:
"O Yantraputraka, though it is the approved opinion of our
assembly still the narration of one's own virtues seems censurable,
therefore you may discribe the king now”, he (the Yantraputraka),
being looked upon with wonderstruck eyes by the friends sitting
near by began to speak:
DESCRIPTION OF BHOJA, THE RULER OF DHĀRĀ
In that city lives MAHÄRĀJĀDHIRĀJA PARAMEŚVARA
ŚRI BHOJADEVA, the king of kings, capable of carrying the burden
of the world; his footstool is reddened by the mass of rays of the
rubies in the rows of crowns of all the bowing kings; the growth of
whose creeper in the form of fame is constantly nourished by the
sprinkling of water in the form of tears from the eyes of the women
of the haughty enemies who are uprooted by his arms;
(8) Who is everyday tortured by women ... having written
with sandal-paste as thick as camphor, on the walls, in the form
of high breasts ..... 'O heartless one! are you not afraid of the
sin of killing women?'; who is the one victorious elephant of Madana
uprooting the tree of pride of the proud women; who is the producer
of love like Sauri «Vişņu, who is the father of Madana»; whose body
is as beautiful as the refulgence of gold mixed with glow of
emeralds; he, whose moonlike nails of the feet reduces the lotus-
like hands of the kings, daily and constantly bowing down, to the
condition of buds, and which has in them reflected the deer by the

rays of emeralds shining in their crests and having similar comple-
xion; whose sprays of flowers of fame daily shone on the trees in the
form of his hands with the leaves in the form of the sword rendered
red by the destruction of herds of intoxicated elephants; who clearly
manifests the inauspicious beginning (of widow-hood) on the tear-
stained cheeks, which are covered with hair, of the wives of the
kings killed in battle; he is the leader amongst the valorous; fore-
most amongst the victorious in battle; he is the one creator who
has whitened the three worlds by the tide of fame possessing lustre as
white as the waves of the Milky ocean motionless because of the
destruction of a great host of enemies come prostrate before him
like Rāma, «i.e, Balarāma who is handsome and who whitened the
three worlds by fame as white as the waves of the Milky ocean be-
came motionless because of the crushing of the powerful enemy
Pralamba»; he is the birthplace of wondrous deeds; among men, he
is a lion with dreadful and sharp nails tearing open the temples of
the haughty elephants in the form of enemies; he had pillar-like
huge hands looking like tying posts for the she-elephant in the form
of the inconstant royal prosperity; who punishes the wrong doer
like Indra «who destroyed the demon Ahi»; who uprooted all the
insignificant Ksatriyas and exhibited his knowledge of archery like
Bhārgava «who uprooted all the Kșatriyas and manifested the
secrets of Dhanurveda»; and who is the one house for the creepers
of knowledge ........ like Bhỉgu.
He is the source of Dharma; the resort of truth; the family-
house of arts; the field of the right conduct of Ksatriyas; the pleasure
garden of the creepers of knowledge; the store house of right con-
duct; the very life of valour; the residence of pleasures; the mine
of compassion; the kinsman of learning; the chief among archers;
and foremost among the virtuous;
(9) as the milky ocean is adorned with waves, as the vault
of the sky with clusters of stars, as the divine tree with sprays of
flowers, as ſeșa with a circle of hoods and the lake with the lotus
stalks, so is he adorned with countless, joy giving, charming virtues,
which are white as Śeșa and which are desired by all the people.
In the speech of the wise who judge his great intellectual
acumen, GURU does not gain such veneration in comparision with
him, BHARGAVA does not possess such brilliancy, UDDHAVA does
not contribute to our joy; CĀŅAKYA does not come within the
enumeration of the learned, and DHARMAKĪRTI does not find
ground among those of keen intellect.
In hundredfold ways on the battle field, the Glory of Victory
continuously seeks asylum in his sword that possesses the lustre
similar to that of a cat's eye-gem, which (sword) is decorated with

earth; is as dark as the leaves of the white lotus plant, is unapproach-
able and is difficult to be plunged into by herds of enemies' elephants
like a lake whose waters possess the colour of a cat's eye-gem, which
is adorned with big lotuses, in which night lotuses grow, which
possess the splendour of blooming blue lotuses, which is dark with
the leaves of the lotus plants, which is very deep and into which
even herds of best elephants cannot bathe.
When his valour, born of his unique splendour which glitters
like the mass of the rays of rubies, which is unsurpassable even by
the sun .......... and which cannot be conquered by others, be-
came a city wall of the earth as of a single town, the four deep
oceans assumed the beauty of a moat. His fame, resembling the
glitter of the polished teeth of the Dravida women, having the com-
plexion of the petals of open jasmine, became ........., paste of
sandal on the creeper-like bodies of the separated-women, balls of
foam on the sea, .........., the celestial Ganges in the expanse of
the sky, the stalks of white-lotus in the lakes, crystal slabs on the
slopes of the mountains, ............., and white cloth in........

whiteness, and as the ocean of milk is of the moon ......

Lord of the Earth himself commenced narrating:-

bewitches all people; the one abode of Love, who vanquishes the
treasure of beauty of the heavenly damsels by her own beauty; who
has a braid of hair quietly hidden behind her like a mass of dark-
ness whose advance in the front has been checked by the refulgence
of the ever-shining moon in the form of her face; who holds as it
were the white umbrella of facial beauty won by the loveliness of
its broad forehead which looks like the digit of the moon on its eighth
day, and which conquers the three worlds with its staff in the form
on the forehead; who bears two creepers in the form of eyebrows
as dark as oily collyrium, slightly bent at the corners due to the

it; who looks bright with two cheeks resembling the disc of the moon
cut into two in order to remove the dark spot; who is charming
with a pair of shapely ears as delicate as the Śirīşa flowers and looking
like the ropes of the snare of the hunter Madana skillful in catching
the deer in the form of the young men, who is beauteous with the
bridge of the nose, with its tip a little raised, resembling the stafi
of the lute of the fish-bannered God; who looks splendid with lips
as red as the ripe bimba fruit or coral of the sea of love, or a leaf
of the creeper of Love; who is charming with the sprout-like neck
with three lines, as delicate as the spring of the trees of Love, as
sweet in sound as a conch; who has creeper-like arms which by its
tenderness mock the lotus plant, on which due to the illusion of its
being a lotus-stalk rests (two) hands like (two) open red loluses
with filaments in the form of the rays of the glowing, tender nails
and which (arms) are attractive because of their well-formed curves
and fleshiness; who has a pair of breasts, plump and well formed
with the tips a little lowered, looking as though they were a
couple of pots to store sensual pleasures; who is adorned with a
waist which is as difficult to be reached as the knotty thoughts of
Mīmāṁsā «which are difficult to understand", which (waist) was not
visible though desired to be seen by all being concealed by the
plump breasts, which though thin had accepted the three folds,
which though delicate had the capacity to bear the weight of the
stout breasts, and which though in the middle yet stood foremost
among all the charming things; whose waist was decorated by a navel
as deep as a lake fit enough for the scented elephants of Madana to
enter for merriment; whose abdomen was divided into two by a
line of hair affording comparison with the string of the bow of Smara
and the line of rut oozing from the elephant of youth, possessing the
temples in the form of breasts; who had hips as wide as the jewei
slabs of the pleasure mountain, looking like a moving place for the
elephant in the form of Madana; whose lower portion (of the body)
had two thighs resembling two tying posts of the intoxicated ele-
phants of Madana and which resembled the trunks of the golden plan-
tain placed opposite each other; who looked shapely with thighs
which were wellformed and symmetrical, not very straight, graceful
and which surpassed the plantain stump in its softness; whose loveli-
ness was augmented by the feet which were like two lotuses, offered
as gifts by the lake of lotuses, being itself vanquished by the splend-
our of the moon in the form of her face; whose pair of feet were
adorned with a row of well-grown glowing nails as if they were a
row of mirriors of Kandarpa to see all the limbs; who was enveloped
in lovliness which over-flowed after completely filling in all the limbs,
just as she was always surrounded with servants; who was wearing

a pair of emerald earings looking like a pair of wheels of the chariot
of Love in the form of her moon-like face; who every day increased
the shade of the patra-latā painted on the cheeks as if for affording
rest to the eyes of the lovers pained by the anguish of the fever of
love caused by the flow of excessive beauty; wearing on her bosom
a necklace looking like a clear stream of nectar flowing from the
pot-like breasts for the coronation of king Madana, looking like the
banner of victory of her own good fortune and bearing resemblance
to a slough of the snake in the form of Madana, protecting the pots
of the treasure of love in the form of the breasts;....
(12) She vanquishes Rati; even the uncensured meet her; she
speaks sweetly and nobly, smiles even when laughed at, gives up vul-
garity, and is not given to too much sexual pleasures; she pleases
others though not in love herself, and comes in contact with the love-
lorn, though not attached herself; (on seeing her) even Goddess Śrī,
who considered herself to have surpassed the Glory of Beauty by her
own beauty, betook to the lotus grove; she seemed to be created by
the Lord Creator, a lake of loveliness, full of the sentiment of love, for
the........ elephants of Love to wander about, pleasing due to the
blue-lotuses in the form of eyes and blooming day-lotuses in the form
of the face, adorned with the lotus plant in the form of the delicate
creeper of hands, with a pair of Cakravāka birds in the form of
high and plump breasts, possessing a whirl pool in the form of a
deep navel and glittering waves in the form of the three folds

by Madana for gaining victory over the three worlds after seeing
the uselessness of his own weapons in the strife with Siva.

talks, distinguished in both kinds of sixtyfour arts, clever in grasp-

answering different kinds of puzzling riddles; alert in eloquence;

It seemed the royal swans adopted graceful movements from
her lotus feet; the plantains drew shapeliness, softness and delicacy
etc. from her thighs; the mountains drew the expanse from her but-

beauty of the waves from her abdomen with three folds; Smara

fashioned his bow-string from her beautiful line of hair; the Cakra-
vāka birds learnt keeping close company from her pair of breasts;
the lotus plants drew out tenderness from her creeper-like hands;
the Aśoka sprouts took loveliness from her lotus-like hands; the
conchshells adopted the beauty of three lines from her neck; the
clusters of corals drew from her lips the natural excellence of red-
ness; the Kanakaketaki acquired pure brilliance from her cheeks; the
doe took unsteadiness from her eyes; the Puņdarīka took whiteness
from her, the Ketaka leaves took sharpness; the good adopted
straight-forwardness; the bees blackness; the moon its curvature
from her pair of creeper-like eyebrows; the knots of the string of
Smara's bow the beauty of form; the strung bow of Love acquired
the beauty of form from her forehead; the plumages of peacocks got
the charm to allure mens' mind from her braid of hair; the full-
moon drew constant splendour and the charm of bewitching mens'
eyes from her face; the cuckoo drew sweetness from her speech; and
the beds of salt took salinity «loveliness» from all her limbs.
(13) In not using the following bevy of helps the Lord Creator
must have procured some other implements for the creation of
her beauty. Thus he did not take the mass of hair of the camari;
not the plumages of peacocks, not swarms of bees, not the crescent
moon, not slabs of gold, ......... not blooming Indivaras, not Ketakt
leaves covered by bees at a corner, not the graces of doe's eyes, not
Pătala flowers, not the beauty of the staff of Madana's lute, not the
Bimbi fruits, not the Bandhujīva flowers, not the clusters of corals,
not the sparkle of the seeds of the ripe promegranates, not the
cooing of the cuckoos, not the notes of the lute, not the beauty of
Bandhuka flowers, not the white splendour of blooming Kanaka
campakas, not the knots of the bow-strings of Smara, not sprouts,
not conchshells, not lotus plants, not the Syāmā creeper, not fresh
leaves, not red lotuses, not pairs of Cakravāka birds, not the temples
of elephants, not the waves of the river, not the loveliness of Smara's
bow-string, not naves of the wheels of Madana's chariot, not slabs
of precious stones, not slabs of gold, not trunks of plaintain, not
the teeth of the Lord of elephants, not Kokanadas, not pearls, not
the stars in autumn, not the gait of the Lord of elephants and not
the movements of the royal swans. And yet the wonderful Creator
created her, a storehouse of wonder. Oh! the skill of the Creator
in fashioning this supernatural beauty!
She possesses 'lāvanya' «loveliness» yet is not saline «caustic»;
though common «harlot» is uncommon «unique»; she becomes attach-
ed to any one near at hand like a crystal doll «which takes the
colour of any adjunct placed near it»; she loves no family like Drau-
padi «who loved Nakula»; she exhibits fleeting fancy like the rainy
season «in which lightning is seen»; with whom all desire to sleep

of Kālāguru like Prāgjyotişa «which has leaves of Kālāguru; and
her eyes are intoxicated due to much sleeplessness like a female snake
“whose eyes are intoxicated with poison and many young ones».
She looks beautiful with knots of curly hair like the army of
Gods which has rounded shares of Varuņa; she has beautiful hair

beautiful nose like the favourite folk lore of people which has des-

the demons Subāhu and Prahasta are famous; she is fascinating with
a navel and plump breasts like the rainy season which is pleasant

utters amorous words like the prose composition 'ŚRNGĀRA-

She, being in the midst of the refulgence of her body spreading

waters churned by the Mandara mountain; she turns the steady

at the beauty of her limbs;..........; who causes the paramours to
experience a terrible, strange and poignant feat of unconsciousness,

is always fully formed, its lustre shines forth even during the day,
it has abandoned the spot, it has friendship with day-lotuses and
enmity with night lotuses, and it possesses a lustre which produces
passion in all; she decks her hair with sprays of flowers as if they

which needs distinguished skill in production, and which conquers
by its feminine beauty all the three worlds? Who are the persons
who love her not? What are they? Who are not deceived? Who are
not cheated? Who have not given their all to her? Where are the
brāhmaṇas, kings, princes, merchants, käyasthas and familymen who
have not become her slaves? He who knows her thinks that he alone
is dear to her, and that she loves him only. She sometimes receives
herds of elephants, sometimes teams of horses, sometimes heaps of
gold, and sometimes curious and gorgeous jewels and clothes. Thus
her riches which daily augment become plenteous. Even then she
does not give up harlotry. She gives a promise only for five-hundred
gold pieces, and because of the splendour of her unrivalled beauty,
she never sleeps alone.
DESCRIPTION OF ŚRNGĀRAMANJARĪ'S MOTHER
Her mother's name is VIŞAMAŠĪLĀ, who is respected by

petalled lotus, which (face) lengthens everyday with the desire to

buffalo .............., who has two eyes, slightly sunk in due to
old age, looking like two dark pits for the men blinded with love

to the root of an Alābu; whose lips have the shape of the upturned
Mallikā leaves; whose ear-lobes are like cords for tying the para-
mours; whose naturally broad cheeks have become all the more broad
due to the looseness (of skin) in old age; (15) who, because her teeth
had fallen, contracted frequently her long lower lip as if to devour the
world; whose two-three teeth were visible like those of a dangerous
poisonous snake; whose limp, thickset and broad neck resembles the
neck of a young wild buffalo; whose joint of the neck is chained by

a series of arteries which look like footpaths for the coming of
other's wealth; whose arms are like the body of an aging python,
suffering in hunger; whose hands look like the fruit of the Kośātaki,
flattened, rough and dried up in the heat of the sun due to the net-
work of arteries seen everywhere from the elbow downwards; who
has a heart harder than the joints of the limbs which have corns;
who has breasts resembling the big and flat wooden jugs tied to the
pagotta; who has joints falling on the sides and the back as if she
were with effort holding hiding places for her conduct; who is exhi-
biting a waist scarcely visible being concealed by a very prominent
navel as if it had run away due to the fear of excessive sensuality;
she drinks space as it were by her enlarging and broad buttocks;
she is adorned with a pair of thighs resembling the staff of an oil-
machine; she has two shanks resembling long and ripe cucumbers;
and she has two worn out, flat, frog-like feet.
It seems she desires to swallow the three worlds as her upper
part of the body is slightly bent down and the corners of the mouth
are open; she seems to provide a swing for Old Age because of
her acquaintance with her since a long time, in the form of the loose
hanging flesh of the arms; she brings to light a picture of her own
conduct by all her limbs adorned with white and wasted scratches
of the nails made by the vagabonds and rivalling the lines of the
chalk like Madana's gambling leather board; who establishes
her unsteadiness in all her limbs by the loose flesh; who resorts to
childhood even though old, as some of her limbs were hunched; she
with her nose curved like a parrot's beak and with her eyes fixed
down is as if desirous of dragging out the serpents possessing flash-
ing jewels even though they had entered the netherland; who is a
cave for hiding the great treasure in the form of cheating the world.
She valued the three worlds at the price of grass; her teeth
has fallen like the course of Kaliyuga when the brāhmaṇas have
fallen in rank»; she has turned away from amorous sport like a bitch
who in coition turns her face another way»; she has destroyed all
the amorous persons like the beak of garuda «who devours all the
serpents»; she is in the company of friends intoxicated with wine like
gardens «where swarms of bees are intoxicated with honey»; she
enjoys seizures like the conduct of the begging brāhmaṇas «who
welcome alms»; she eats lots of fish and goats like the moon «who
passes from the zodiac of Mina (Pisces) and Meşa (Aries)»; she has
hundreds of pearls like the Tāmraparņi river «which has hundreds
of pearls»; she is full of hypocrisy like the behaviour of a cat «in
which deception is prominent»; she aims at another's wealth like
the minds of a great men «which are intent on doing good to
others»; she has conquered the three worlds by her adventures like
Vāmana «who covered the three worlds with his footsteps»; she has

tenet of Pañcarātra «according to which the state of enjoymerit
(similar to gods) is achieved by the power of Māyā»; she is void of
love like the grains of sand which have no oil"; she has devoured
all the wealth like the Ganges which has covered the whole world
she is hard to be understood like the form of Viśvarūpa «which is
difficult to look at»; she is clever in making room for another by
means of rules like the rule of Grammar in which the preposition
turns the (verb) into parasmaipada»; she is skilful in creating beauty
like a group of students «clever in knowing the declension of iorms> ;
she is intent on shaking off (people) like the mind of a sage «eager
to obtain salvation»; she has destroyed other people like the tenet
of the Lokāyatas «who do not accept the existence of another world»;
and she captures a person by the means by which he can be taken in
to the best of advantage like the policy of CĂNAKYA by which a
person can be captured by any means
She is proficient in arts, quick in reading the minds of others,
conversant in the profession of courtesans, smart in cheating others,
(16) an expert in subduing the arrogant paramours, clever in decep-
tion, conversant in talks practised by harlots, bold in speaking pur-
poseful words, and has the sharpness to get together those separated.
She shows everything but does not give anything; sometimes,
however, she gives a little and then takes away even the hidden
treasure as water gone into the ears is drawn out by the juice of
vāla; she has mastery over the secrets of harlotry; she is never
cheated by vițas; she is requested by dhūrias for deceiving others
but is never troubled; she deceives others but is riever deceived her.
self; she stupefies others but does not become stupefied herself; she
troubles others but is never troubled herself; she bewilders others
but is not bewildered herself; she gives hopes but like a mirage
never fulfills them. She is the abode of falsehood; the house of hypo-
crisy, the mansion of delusion, the residence of roguery, the path of
bad conduct, the place of false modesty, the resort of courtesy, and
sole actor of the drama of deception.
It appears that she is the movement of Fate's designs, the doer
of evils and the destroyer of good things; her beginning, middle
and end is not known like that of destiny; she is nice but cannot
be thought of like Avidyā; she brings about bad after-effects like
the eating of the Kimpāka fruit; she shows straightforwardness, but
is wicked in actions like the body of a serpent which is straight but
moves zigzag»; she does nothing good to others like worldly life
in which there is absence of the ultimate reality. She is the
store-house of adharma, the mine of flattery, the life of deceit, the
residence of adventure, the origin of sin, the place of fickleness, the
house of conciliation, the mansion of fraud, the house of pretence.

A LESSON FOR SÃNGĀRAMAÑJARI
Now, once, during the last quarter of the day when the sun had
mellowed, VIŞAMAŠĪLĀ seated on a nearby bed. spoke to
ŚRNGĂRAMANJARĪ who had just finished her meals and was re-
clining on a rich bed under a canopy bright with many jewels:
“Child, being intoxicated with your good fortune that is on par with
your beauty, do not err. Generally speaking, how many unguarded
courtesans have not been deceived by dhūrtas? How many have
not been cheated? How many have not lost their all? Therefore,
daughter! always be cautious in guarding your mind and your
wealth. Always be careful to practising) the art of harlotry and
in propitiating the minds of others. For, it is possible to please a
person only when his mind has been attracted, and he only whose
mind has been propitiated dedicates his wealth and his life. You,
who are proud of your fortune, have not known till now how once

a person's mind is known, how he should be pauperised and then
driven out. How the same person should be contacted again in
affluence; how a person should first be attracted, how he should be
made constant when after once uniting he wishes to be separate;
how he should be won over again by unequivocal love once he is
displeased, and how his mind should be drawn towards you once
he is attached to another. The dispositions of the mind of all be-
ings are difficult to understand. Men have different minds and
.......... If there is a timid person he exhibits valour; if he is
greedy he becomes charitable; if he is generous he becomes a miser;
if he is unfortunate he acts like a fortunate man. A merchant
acts like a Vita and a Vita like a merchant. A poor man even acts
like a richman. One man is inclined towards Dharma, another is
intent on wealth, and a third is predominantly sensuous. Thus
when minds are of such diverse dispositions you must properly
understand the working of the mind first.. First. without becom-
ing attached to a person, he should be dispossessed of all his wealth
by either encouraging, flattering, spurning, frightening or pleasing
him according to his bent of mind, then he should be driven out.
Under the circumstances, the rāga of a person should first be consi-
dered. When harlotry is practised without knowing the natue of
rāga it is fruitless. But when it is used after the rāga is known
it happily yields fruit. Rāga is of 12 kinds: Nili rāga, Rīti räga,
Akşiba rāga, Mañjisthā rāga. Kāṣāya rāga, Sakala rāga, Kusumbha
räga. Lākṣā rāga, Kardama rāga, Haridrā rāga, Rocanā raga and
Kāmpilya rāga. (19) The Nīli rāga, the Riti rāga and Akşiba rāgi form
one group. The Manjişthā rāga, the Kāṣāya räga and Sakala rāgir
another. The Kusumbha rāga, the Lākşā rāga and the Kardama
rāga yet another, and the Haridrā rāga, the Rocanā rāga and the
Kāmpilya rāga a fourth class. In the first group of Nīli rāga, the
Riti and the Akşiba rāgas are less steady than the Nīli rāga, still on
the manifestation of the Nīli rāga they are seen. In the Manjişthā
class the Kāṣāya and the Sakala rāgas are less steady than the Man
jişthā rāga yet they come to light on the appearance of the Manjistha
rāga. In the Kusumbha rāga class, the Lākşā rāga and the Kar-
dama rāgas are less steady than the Kusumbha rāga, yêt due to the
manifestation of the Kusumbha lāga they are reflected. In
the Haridrā rāga class though the Rocanā rāga and Kampilya
rāga are less steady than the Haridrā rāga still due to
the shining of the Haridrā rāga they are reflected. Thus
though rāga is described to be of twelve shades. as the
other become merged in these four, to satisfy your curiosity, I
shall explain it to you only in its four kinds: Nīlī rāga. Manjişthā
rāga, Kusumbha rāga and Haridrā rāga.

The (man of) Nili rāga should be abandoned after taking away
his essence like a cloth; the Mañjişthā rāga should be dispossessed (of
his resources) at your pleasure, but should not be led to be disinte-
rested. The Kusumbha rāga cannot tolerate much flattery, therefore
without any flattery, his resources should be drained out whether the
circumstances be favourable or not. The Haridrā rāga soon
becomes estranged, therefore, he should be quickly drained (of his
wealth).
Therefore, the secret of the profession of harlotry is this that
one's own self should always be protected from love as from a tiger,
In the world. many sensuous persons have been deceived by har-
lots due to their rāgas. I shall tell you how. Listen:--
THUS ENDS THE 'LESSON FOR ŚRNGĂRAMAÑJARI' IN THE
SRNGĂRAMAÑJARIKATHA COMPOSED BY MAHĀRĀJĀDHI-
RĀJA-PARAMESVARA-ŚRĪBHOJADEVA.
THE FIRST TALE OF RAVIDATTA
Here in the town of Kundinapura dwelt a rich learned bräh.
maņa called SOMADATTA. In his old age he begot a son by
propitiating the Sun, the giver of desired objects, by observing the
Vijayāsaptamí. As the child was given by the Sun, the father
named him RAVIDATTA. By the time he was sixteen years old,
he was given the sacred thread and he studied the whole literature
of the Vedas and the Vedāngas according to rites and mastered all
the śāstras. His father then, being aware of his being rich, taught
him all the arts as a remedy against the danger of his being ruined
in future; the secrets of harlotry as laid down by DATTAKA and
others was specially made known to him.
One day, calling him in private he (the father) instructed him:
"Son, youth is dense darkness and it cannot be avoided by living
beings; Madana is wicked and wealth is the one abode of intoxica-
tion. The mind by nature is as inconstant as a drop of water on
the lotus leaf; senses are as unrestrainable as untamed elephants; the
objects of pleasure are naturally fascinating (20) and amongst these
especially young damsels. The beginning of the monsoon and the
autumn and the other seasons are great excitants. And who can
possibly resist Love, their friend? Therefore, you should conquer
the group of six enemies, then the senses, then the inspiration of
the wicked people in proximity, then the contact of wanton women.
For wanton women, the sisters of the female drștivişa serpents,
produce infatuation of the mind even from a distance. The teach-
ings of the elders slip away from the infatuated mind; the study of
Šāstras glide away from a distance; teaching is brought to a naught,
the sense of self-respect is lost; the pride of class, etc. disappears;

the bridge of character melts; courage fails, discrimination dis-
appears; strength is crushed and maturity flies away. Many who
have erred have been destroyed. The company of the wicked,
which is void of affection by nature, should be avoided even from
a distance; the sight of dhūrtas is as undesirable as bad dreams and
the company of șingas is the unbolted door to evils. The sound of
the triple harmony of instrumental music, singing and dancing is
the drum announcing the banishment of wealth; songs are the
hunter's songs to capture the deer in the form of mind; the merri-
ments of pleasure-gardens are vital blows to wealth; the dips in
waters for sport are the drowning of wealth; religious pilgrimages
are the funeral processions of prosperity; the impassioned glances
of young women bring about evil like drudgery; dice are the
enemies of discrimination; the ties of friendship with singas are
· tightenings of fetters; gambling is the secret intention of acquiring
wealth; the courtyards of prostitutes are sisters of slaughter houses;
the streets in vicinity of brothels are unwholesome; therefore,
being cautious, you should act in consideration of your own posi-
tion. Who have not been reduced to the state of derision by act-
ing contrary to their rank and position? We hear that even power-
ful kings like Purūravas and others were brought under subjection
by courtesans like Urvaśī and others”.
Now, as days passed by, when his father had died and his
mother followed him, and when with the passage of time his sor-
row had lessened, Spring, the fiend of the fish-bannered God and
the dancing teacher of the actor, sentiment of love, set in.
(It was the season) when gradually the mango groves were in-
laid with clusters of buds; when the throats of the cuckoos became
red with singing in the fifth note; when the Mādhavi creepers were
pained by the repeated blossoming (of flowers); when the thick
clusters of lotuses smiled a little on seeing the perplexities of the
separated people; when the forests of Kimśuka trees, because they
were full of burning charcoals (in the form of flowers), appeared
as if enveloped in the flames of love uprising after the smoke was
seen first; when the Aśoka trees causing anguish to the separated
ones by the abundance of blooming clusters were flashing in all the
directions like the fire of love; when buds of blue, red and tawny
colours, looking like Rati's bejewelled sporting ornaments, cropped
up, fascinating the minds of all; when swarms of bees desirous of
the fine fragrance of the Kurabaka trees did not steadily remain
anywhere, because they had no attachment like the group of the
separated; when the rows of trees attained loveliness like a new
bride, being covered with a veil in the form of the fresh leaves;
when the cooing of flocks of cuckoos was heard everywhere like the
sound of the twanging of the strings (of the bow) of the flower-

arrowed-one practising with arrows for conquering the three worlds;
(21) when the rows of bees on every flowering tree locked beauti-
ful like the string of the bow prepared by Spring with a garland of
black Kunda flowers for the fish-bannered God, the best archer in
the three worlds; when the leaves of trees gleamed as if they were
the chaplet of the Glory of the garden come during Spring; when
the Malaya wind, carrying the perfume of the newly blossomed
Bakula flowers, blew gently from the southern direction for
enkindling the fire of love in the heart of travellers when the ban-
ner of Manmatha made of silk .... was waved on every tree by the
continuously blowing Malaya breeze like the love of couples; when
the love songs which were like the songs of the hunter for captivat-
ing the deer in the form of love; of the women busy swinging and
not afraid of the embraces of their pitiless lovers spread in all
directions as if they were the proclamations of the victorious rule
of Smara; when the nights became short as if 'out of compassion
(thinking) 'who amongst the separated lovers would bear our
long duration?'; when during the days, heat increased as if due to
repentance (thus) 'Ah! how much more will the separated lovers
suffer at our coming during the Spring, which is a friend of Ananga
and the abode of all pleasures?'; when the directions were envelop-
ed by the thick mass of pollen from the clusters of open lotuses
spreading with the winds, looking like the fire of calamity indica-
tive of the destruction of the separated ones. And when it seemed
that from everyside from the earth uprose the fire of love of the
separated ones in the form of garden ponds full of thickly growing
Kokanada clusters, the trees in the pleasure ponds continuously
putting forth new sprouts, the Asoka trees marked by numerous
clusters of flowers and the forests of Kimśukas flowering in all
directions.
Once, (in spring) RAVIDATTA was thus spoken to by a com-
pany of Vitas; "Today is the festive procession of the fish-bannered
God. If it is not seen what is the use of life? What is the use then
of this fruitless pair of eyes? Ah, gentle one! even if you have no
curiosity, still complying with our wishes you should definitely come
to see it. If you do not come, have we no authority over you to
make you fulfil over desire? Therefore, come along, we will go'.
He remembered his elders' instructions and did not wish to go, yet,
as if forcibly instigated to go forward by youth that followed him,
and as if pulled in front by the senses as by friends, like an intoxi-
cated elephant, he went to the pleasure park called KUSUMĀKARA.
The (garden) was like a storehouse of weapons or a place
of enjoyment or the house of pleasure of the fish-bannered God be-
cause of the buds on various rows of trees or because of the abun-
dant blooming flowers; which (garden) looked splendid with the

Bakula trees, emitting under the pretext of the fragrance of the
flowers the scent transferred to it by mouthfuls of wine by the
women intoxicated with youth; where at some places, at the base
of pleasure hillocks, the Kurabaka trees stood like lovers with hair
standing on end due to the opening of innumerable buds at the
touch of the pot-like breasts of the women inebriate with youth;
where at some places the sides of the pleasure lakes were adorned
with Tilaka trees looking like the storehouse of the flowery-arrowed-
one's weapons, with the thickly grown sprays of blossoms opening
as they were made the object of the eyes of the doe-eyed ones, as
long as a garland of Kuvalaya petals, with their corners inconstant
due to drinking; where the border regions of Ananga's mansion
was decorated with branches of Asoka trees which were like the
abode of the fire of Love, which (trees) were marked by an abun-
dance of bunches of flowers and leaves on being kicked by the lotus
feet of the women, which (feet), had natural redness as if they were
coloured with the Alaktaka dye; where at some places the sides of
the ....... the tanks looked beautiful with the .... trees looking
like the golden necklace of Rati because the rows of thickly growing
yellow flowers were opening out at (22) the sweet and soft notes
issuing from the throats of the slightly intoxicated women.
(The description of the pleasure park, KUSUMAKARA,
ends, here. There RAVIDATTA sees the mansion of Madana
which is made of white crystalline stones. In the mansion he sees
lovely woman looking like the presiding deity of Love. Seeing her
RAVIDATTA wonders about the skill of production of the creator,
that -- "This one, who by her loveliness has put aside the beauty
of the divine damsels has been created (by the creator) with great
efforts after giving up his other creations in order to prove his skill
in production. Since the beautiful things that are used to make
her limbs do not resemble even singly the Kamala, the Kuvalaya,
the Aśoka, the moon and other things,
On seeing her he thought.-Oh in creation this is an unparallel-
ed achievement of Prajapati; a matchless type among the class of
women; a new sea of loveliness; an elixir of the life of love; a new
form in forms; an incarnation of youth even of youth; the loveli-
ness of loveliness; an excess of beauty even of beauty; a flood of
ambrosia for the eyes of the onlooker; a chip of camphor to the eyes
of young women; another creator for the creation of Ananga's body;
gain of an unconquerable and a novel weapon to Madana; another
magnet for attracting the hearts of all people; an embodied fruit-

sures; the one cause of perplexing people by her own coquetry; the

She also on seeing the youth of charming form and opulent
appearance became enamoured of him for a moment. She frequent-

ly glanced at him with affectionate eyes and exhibited her love by
amorous gestures. Inferring his affluence from his form, she
thought-'Ah! after a long time a treasure had been obtained;
after a long time the tree of hope has bloomed, desire has flowered,
and ambitions have borne fruit. (24) Therefore, hence forth, let
artful graces revive and let the secrets of harlotry become mani-
fest. Thinking thus, she started talking smilingly to a friend
nearby and looked at him now and then making graceful move-
ments. RAVIDATTA, who till now had not experienced the
charms of love knew that very moment that she was enamoured of
him, and as if coached by the Fish-bannered-one himself, under-
stood that the gestures were directed to him only. He became
doubly excited in mind with love, and thinking that his reactions
should not be known to the others, he slowly entered (the mansion)
and after performing the worship of Kandarpa, the destroyer of the
pride of the three worlds, and offering salutations duly, he went
away. Then under the excuse of seeing the pleasure park, with the
mind not fixed elsewhere, thinking of her only, he proceeded to-
wards his house. She also, following him with her friends, not
avoiding his glances and exhibiting various love gestures, went to
her house.
When two or three nūdikās of the day remained, she,
VINAYAVATĪ, sent her dear friend SANGAMIKÄ to his house.
Going there she stood at his doors for a moment, then announced
by his young friends, she entered. Taking her seat she said: 'I
have something to say, give me a private audience', and stopped.
RAVIDATTA, recognizing her as her (VINAYAVATI'S) compani-
on, was pleased. He indicated with his eye-brows the company of
friends to go elsewhere.
Getting an opportunity she said: "Good one! though this is
against your rank and position yet as I am inflicted by anguish be-
cause of my mistress, I tell you this, please listen. Since your lord-
ship came within the sight of my mistress during the festive pro-
cession of Madana, you have entered her heart cleft by hundreds
of arrows of Smara. Since then her heart is pierced by a shaft, her
mind is intoxicated, her body trembles and her breathing is heavy;
her eyes are anxious to see you, her ears are delighted to hear your
virtues, her speech is pregnant with your name, and her desires
are to be united with you. You are a righteous man, therefore
give my friend the boon of life. Take compassion on the wretched
one by coming there yourself. In your sinştis and other sästrus it
is said that the killing of a woman is a great sin. If you do not
oblige her by coming now then know her indeed to be dead".

Saying so she stopped. On hearing this, RAVIDATTA for a moment.
remained perplexed as to what should be done. He was tortured
on the one hand by bashfulness, on the other by love, on the one
hand by discrimination, on the other by agitation, on the one hand
by the instructions of the elders, on the other by the intoxication
of youth. After sometime he thought-let it be so at present'--
and spoke tenderly, with affection, to SANGAMIKĀ:
“Is there anything that remains for me to be said? The eyes of
your mistress even by chance do not fall on the unfortunate, what
to say of a heart full of love? All people desire her company, and
the fact that she desires (anyone) is not possible even for Desire
to desire. Therefore, I accept what you say. But this is contrary
to my rank and position, so as my relations and elders ............

costly ornaments, hundreds of gold pieces and various clothes,
giving up the sense of shame and disregarding his elders' instruc-
tion.
ense of dreds of Sovery little.net,
She perfectly understood his Nili rāga and arranging picnics,
festival of the third, religious pilgrimages and receiving presents
from him she divested him of all his wealth and made him a pauper.
Then through SANGAMIKĀ she sent him a word:
“Today an old acquaintance, a merchant prince called VASU-
DATTA, has come from Suvarṇadvīpa after amassing a lot of
wealth. Being attached to VINAYAVATI he moves about here
and there saying that if she calls him even for a night he will give
away all his wealth to her. Therefore you should stay at your
place for two or three days ...... (All this wealth has been) given
by you and this also will be of use to you”.
Having told him thus, he was driven out. RAVIDATTA sat
in his home considering what she would be thinking ........ would
she be united with him? Would he not become her lover also-
thus he neither ate, nor slept, nor spoke, nor heard. He did not find
peace anywhere as if he was pierced by a thorn in the vitals, and
as if bit by a scorpion.
.
When two-three days passed thus he went to VINAYA-
VATI'S house in the company of Capalaka. He moved about to
and fro. No one talked to him, no one noticed him. On seeing
him they insulted him. Even then, with his passion redoubled, he

spent that day in false hope looking towards her with a raised
neck.
Next day, wandering the same way, talking to one of her ser-
vants he went to SANGAMIKĀ'S house. There, when she did not
speak to him, he said to her "SANGAMIKA, I have done as you bid
me do. Two-three days have passed. Now why this delay?”
After he said this, being disregarded by SANGAMIKA he followed
her repeating the same thing. Then SANGAMIKĀ spoke to him as
if he was not known to her:--"Who are you sir? What is this
talk about two-three days? and what delay? Why do you thus
speak like a madman?”
Thus rebuked by her he passed two-three days moving about here
and there, sticking on to her.
. On seeing VINAYAVATi from a distance he used to smile and
make amorous actions like one insane. He did not know anything
even when her men derided him. (26) Being thus disregarded by
VINAYAVATI and laughed at by her servants, giving up shame
of his elders he spent the remaining days of his life considering
himself to be fortunate that he could see her at times.
. Thus oh Daughter! knowing his unflinching rāga, harlotry was
brought to a successful end (by VINAYAVATI). As a cloth dyed
in indigo though washed by soda and the like by different methods
does not leave its colour, similarly a man possessing Nīli rāga,
even when ruined in a hundred ways, does not give up his deep
attachment.

Having said this, when VIŞAMAŠILĀ stopped in her speech,
ŚRNGĀRAMAÑJARI, whose curiosity had been roused, said again
"Mother you have described the Nilī rāga. My curiosity increases,
therefore now tell me about the Manjişthā Rāga”. Hearing this
she began: In the city of Tảmalipti ruled a king PRATAPAMUKUȚA
and dwelt a prince named VIKRAMASIMHA. He was rich, chari-
table, noble, pleasure loving and valorous.
One day loitering in the locality of the courtesans he saw MALA-
IKI, the daughter of the bawd EKADASTRA. She was the
life of youth, the breath of loveliness, the life of good fortune and the
soul of beauty. Of her, possessing a face like the fullmoon, the

DATTA on whom she depended for her livelihood. After having
seen her the Prince became very miserable, his heart being pierced
by Kandarpa's arrows. He sent his companion PRIYAMVADAKA
to her. Going to her according to his (Prince's) instructions he said:
"Good lady, on seeing you prince VIKRAMASIMHA has fallen in
love with you and is tortured by passion. In consultation with me
as to how you could be approached he sent me here. Therefore tell
me, (27) what should be done now”? Saying this he became silent.
Hearing these words MĂLATIKĀ said, “Since I saw him, I have
been tormented with love. But being helpless due to my accepting
ineans of livelihood from VASUDATTA I do not know what to do.
Such is our contract, and it is shameful and improper to break a con-
tract. What can I do? But, after some days I will make an effort
to bring an occasion which will enable me to contact him. This
matter is not so much dear to him as to me, and the time of contract
is also nearing end". Saying this she sent away PRIYAMVADAKA.
Having gone, PRIYAMVADAKA spoke to VIKRAMASIMHA about
her love for him and the hope of meeting her.

spreading out in the form of lightning, whose fierce rows of teeth

(THE THIRD TALE OF MADHAVA)
Now, when ŠĶNGĀRAMAÑJARI said “Mother, I remain un-
satiated (by hearing) these stories narrated by you. Please tell me
therefore the means of winning over a person of Kusumbha rāga"-
VIŞAMAŠĪLĀ began:
In the city of Vidiśā there lived a bawd by name BHUJANGA-
VĀGURĀ. Her daughter's name was KUVALAYAVALI. She was
the one abode of beauty, youth, charm, and grace, and her chief
aim was to earn money. In that city where she was earning wealth
by harlotry turned up by chance a learned brāhmaṇa named
MADHAVA, after amassing inexhaustible wealth from Siṁhala-
dvīpa. Hearing of her fame, he sent her the fees and spent with her
one night. Being gratified that same night, in the morning he gave
her a lot of wealth, thus satisfied her and left her alone as was be-
fitting. After two or three days he was again called by her. He
was again served with a bath, food and so on the same way and
slept there the same way. Thus being sometimes invited and some.
times sent away, he spent many happy days in her company.
One day she arranged a gambling party and began draining the
resources of MADHAVA. After many days she divested him of all
his wealth. When he was pauperised he knew that now she would
drive him out, therefore (29) he should act in such a manner that his
reputation would not be completely ruined. While he was thus
thinking monsoon, which produced torments of love, by the direc-

cocks who look like the blooming Kuțaja flowers, came to an end.
And descended again the Autumn, as if to encourage him, which
procured for the Lord of Rati a sovereign rule (lit. having one um-
brella) in the three worlds and which was the seed of activity of
those desirous of conquering; when (in autumn) the clouds
became white as if brought to bear palor by the sandalpaste of the
women in the form of directions separated from the rainy days as

come lean, being free from fat (clouds); when rows of royal swans,
who by their lustre surpass the rays of the autumnal moon and who
were eager for the lotus lakes flew in the directions like the fame
of the flowered-arrowed-one which is continuously seeking desirous
paths; when the forests, imitated the dark beauty of the eyes of the
protectress of the rice-field by the fully blooming Kuvalayas, after
giving up the mass of clouds which were insignificant because the
weight of the water had flowed out due to constant raining; when
the lustre of the sun, continuously spreading in the world as if at
the order of the Fish-bannered-God, bore more heat; when the lakes
of the lotuses raised their heads in the form of lotuses with their
curly hair in the form of the blooming Kuvalayas ........ to see
the Autumn which is enchanting due to the blooming Kuvalayas and
the sweet cackling of the female swans; when the moonlight which
destroyed the beauty of clusters of Kumudas, every night and in
every lake produced swarms of bees, the life breath of the self-born
one like Rati who got back his life; and, like a fair lady, whose mind
does the air Autumn not captivate, with her face in the form of
the moon free from clouds, smiling under the guise of the open
Kāśa flowers, with a sweet voice in the form of the intoxicated and
cackling swans, with teeth in the form of the open Bandhūka flowers,
with eyes in the form of the blooming Indīvaras, with breasts in the
form of the clouds as white as dried sandal, with delicate hands in
the form of the fresh lotus-plants, possessing three folds in the form
of the small streams, with broad thighs in the form of the clear
sandy banks, decorated with a tinkling girdle in the form of the row
of the cranes sweetly clucking, and with a lustre in the form of
fresh open Bijaka flowers?
MADHAVA, knowing this to be the proper time for journeying
desired to go to the Malaya country in search of wealth. He said
to the bawd: “It is our duty to secure wealth and spend it. I am
proceeding therefore towards the Malaya country to earn wealth.
Hearing this KUVALAYAVALI started weeping and said to him:

in hor "How can I dare to take you to the forest un
"I cannot live even for a moment without you”. MADHAVA said
to her, "How can I dare to take you to the forest full of lions and
tigers? I will return after sometime. (30) Do not unnecessarily
feel miserable".
.. When thus addressed she cried more, shedding tears as big as
pearls, and said "I do not desire to sustain my life even for two or
three days without you, what to say of so many days? Therefore
take mercy on me and stay here for sometime". In this manner,
uttering words befitting a harlot, she tried to dissuade him but he
did not stay back. While leaving he gifted to her his gorgeous up-
per garment.
Both of them followed him for some distance when the bawd
said :
"Sir, how will she live without you? Therefore please give her
something as a token of remembrance".
He replied, "I have no such token with me".
To that the bawd made a rejoinder: “As a token of remem-
brance give this garment of yours. Remembering that it had been
worn by you, thinking of you only, and waiting hopefully for your
return only, she will pass her days”.
"I will do that” he said, “but many travellers come this way,
and I feel shy. On leaving this path I shall give it to you".
After going some more distance, he saw a lonely spot and he
called the bawd. He threw her on the ground, and while she lay
tossing about, shrieking ‘Mother! Run, run,' he quickly and forci-
bly cut off her ears and nose. And said to her, "the garment that
you asked for as a token of remembrance is not everlasting. For
remembrance this token I give you". Saying this, thinking that his
purpose had been served, not worrying about his loss of wealth, he
went away
... Therefore, child! even the passionate become indifferent when
troubled. The men of Kusumbha rāga become averse and bring
about évil. Therefore without giving offence to them and guarding
the causes that lead to estrangement, the people of Kusumbha rāga
should be drained of their resources. As a cloth dyed in Kusumbha
cannot bear heat, washing and the like, so also the man possessing
the Kusumbha rāga”.
Then ŚRNGARAMAÑJARI said, "Mother, my curiosity in-
creases, therefore tell me all that has been alluded to by you”.

When addressed thus, she (VIŞAMAŠILA) said, "Child, now

how a man of Haridrā rāga can be won over",
THUS ENDS THE THIRD TALE OF MADHAVA IN THE SRN-
GARAMANJARIKATHA COMPOSED BY MAHĀRĀJÁDHIRĀJA-
PARAMESVARA-SRĪBHOJADEVA.
(THE FOURTH TALE OF SŪRADHARMAN)
Here on the banks of the Ganges, is a town of the brāhma-
nas called Hastigrāma. There lived a brāhmaṇa called SŪRA-
DHARMAN. He was extremely poor as were also his father and
grandfather. He did not obtain sufficient food ... (31) and he be-
came a young man by the time his father died. He saw the wealth of
the other persons of the town and felt miserable, and wondered by
what means he would obtain such wealth. 'Riches help to gain more
riches, but I have nothing. I would serve a king, but I do not know
how. Now what should I do? Be it so, I shall worship the Lord
of the Sea'.
Resolving thus, wandering he came to the shores and saw the
sea. (The sea) which was embracing as it were his beloved, the
Glory of the sky with plump breasts, by waves scraping the sky,
surpassing the mountains by their heights, adorned with various
precious jewels and whitened by balls of foam as white as sandal-
paste; whose water was drunk by the submarine-fire which assumed
many bodies, being unable to drink it all with one, under the guise
of the flashing creepers of corals.
To such a god of the sea he started paying homage. Every
morning wearing a short leather petticoat and taking a staff in his
hands he would go and offer a handful of flowers to the sea, and
bowing down he would move forward and backward with the tide
and the ebb. Spending the whole day thus, in the evening after
paying his salutations to the sea he would return. He spent many
years thus, sustaining himself on alms.
Now once, taking pity on him, the sea, assuming the form of
a small boy said to him: "Oh! Brāhmaṇa, why do you trouble your-
self day and night by coming and going?” Being thus spoken to,
he said: (32) "Young man, why do you worry about it? Go your
own way". But when the boy persistently asked him he said: "I am
much afflicted by poverty which has come down to me from gene-
rations together with my family traditions. Therefore I am wor-
shipping the sea”. Seeing his firm resolve, the boy said: "I am the

this invaluable jewel" having said so, he gave it to him. Receiving
it SURADHARMAN considered his efforts fruitful and happily went
home. He wondered how it could be protected. Thinking a way
out, he tore open his thigh, put the jewel in it and then healed it
up. He then dressed like a madman, wearing rags, tying a dried
garland on the head, eating on the way, sleeping anywhere, his
body stained with dirt, and muttering only ‘Mother knows'. People
heart fascinated by its glory had taken up his abode after having
given up his stay at Kailāsa ?
Wandering thus on the road he reached Ujjayini after some days.
How could that (city) be described where even the Lord of the
three worlds, Śrī Mahākālanātha prompted by pleasures and his
heart fascinated by its glory had taken up his abode after having
given up his stay at Kailāsa?
The city was protected by King VIKRAMARKA, who by the
valour of his arms destroyed all his enemies and who imposed taxes
like Trivikrama (Vişnu, who captured Bali). He had a courtesan
named DEVADATTĀ who attracted the minds of all people. She was
rich and famous. She was the one abode of beauty, charm, youth,
cleverness and grace. She used to travel always searching for some.
one wealthy and fit to be fleeced. Once when she mounted on a
cart drawn by horses and was accompanied by five or six hundred
foot-soldiers and a retinue of clever maids she saw the mad man,
Noticing his form she knew for certain that the man was in posses-
sion of some treasure for which even the three worlds were worth-
less, that the rogue was not mad by nature but only posing like a
madman for some reason. Thinking thus, she said to him: "Good
one, whence do you come? Where do you wish to go?” Though,
asked thus many times he only replied 'mother knows'. Then by
her intuition knowing of his real self, she made him sit on the rear
of the cart and brought him home. There he was bathed, fed and
adorned with clothes, ornaments and unguents worthy of men of her
company and she enjoyed with him sensual pleasures.'
She spent six months with him in a similar manner, giving up
her harlotry and neglecting her services to the king. Even by mis-
take he never gave another reply, but spoke as he had spoken
before. Once it occurred to him that she had brought him because
she had judged him correctly so it may be that by staying there
more he might give her everything out of infatuation. (33) The best
thing to do therefore was to go away from there. But wondering
how to go away, he folded his hands and pointing towards his own
country, indicating his desire to go, he frequently said 'mother
knows'. ...

"I shall not be able to live even for a moment without you.
Sir, why do you go away? If you wish to go for obtaining riches
then all my wealth is yours”, Saying this, she gave him her neck-
laces, jewelled armlets and wealth in gold and started weeping:
"If", (she continued) "you wish to go to your country to meet your
people, then I have got friends who will bring them here". Thus
was he addressed, but he repeatedly said 'mother knows' and point-
ed towards his own country. When Devadattā thought that she
had been deceived and it was not possible to hold him back any
more, he was permitted to go, and he quickly started for his own
country. After that she reflected thus: “My life is lost, this beauty
of youth is fruitless, the pride of good fortune is worthless, the
secrets of cheating rogues studied since birth bears no fruit and the
secrets of harlotry as taught by groups of bawds and handed down
through generations have vanished. Now if he thus escapes de-
ceiving me, then I shall cut off my breasts and throw them into
fire". Resolving thus, she called two girls and instructed them to
go after him.
- She said, “Avoiding his sight you two should go two yojanas
by the by-path. After you have covered two yojanas, one of you
should come from the opposite village towards him. The other
should walk slowly behind him. Then the one coming from the
front should ask the one near him, as if recognizing who she is, and
then act as has been taught".
Both of them followed him, and met each other the way it has
been described. And one said: “Priyangikā! whence do you come?"
Priyangikā: “From Ujjayini. But Lavangikā! from where do you
come?” Lavangikā "From this village. Many days have passed
since I left Ujjayinī, therefore tell me how is the king? what is
condition of the state? and what is the news?” Conversing thus,
picking up pieces of dungs, they walked some distance with him.
- Priyangikā: "Sister Lavangikā! How shall I express? In Uj-
jayinī I heard of a great wonder. The courtesan by name Devadattā
fell in love with some mad man. Though she tried to hold him back
by offering him all her wealth he did not stay back. Disregarding
her he went away somewhere. (34) That very moment, with her
heart broken out of love for him she died. And now the women of
her retinue and her dependents are preparing to die”.
...On hearing this Sūradharman, who was walking, abruptly came
to a stop. He asked: "What are you talking about?” When he was
told everything upto 'he went away somewhere he muttered: 'I

ed to Devadattā's house.
When he reached there he saw on one side pieces of sandal-
wood, on the other curious garments and pots of ghee, and also
heard the wailings of her routine. On seeing him from a distance
MAKARADAMȘTRĀ shouted:
: "Oh! sinner, have you returned? Having killed my daughter
who was my life and the ornament of the whole world, what else
have you come to do? By whose favour will this family live now?
How will I live? You have destroyed the head of the family".
While she was saying thus, he saw the lifeless DEVADATTA
placed on bier. Then he said sharply: "Mother, why do you re-
proach me? Inevitable is the course of Destiny. What purpose is
served by scorning me? It is your Fate that this calamity has be-
fallen you. Be it so. I do not desire to live without her". Saying
this, resolving to put an end to his life, he tore open his thigh and
gave. her the invaluable jewel which by its lustre reddened the
directions. He further said, “By obtaining this jewel your family
has bid farewell to poverty". The bawd then said to DEVADATTA in
her own language: “Rise, O perturbed one!”. As soon as the am-
brosial words entered her ears, DEVADATTĀ breathed a little,
stretched her body twice or thrice and started looking around. Im-
mediately joyous shouts burst forth. Felicitations were offered,
and rumour spread that DEVADATTĀ had been taken by death but
has recovered again. Clasping her to neck MAKARADAMSTRA
chided her. Some one quickly fell at her feet and some others roll-
ed in front of her. Gradually when festivity ended, MAKARA-
DAMSTRĂ reproached even the son-in-law, then bathed hin, clothed
him, and welcomed him again. DEVADATTA also bathed, put un-
guents and ornaments and spent three-four days with him.
Now once at midnight, while he was talking lovingly to her
about different things, due to force of habit the words 'mother
knows' escaped him.
DEVADATTĀ asked: “Ah, does your mother know or do I
know?” (35) Folding his hands he said: “Mother does not know any.
thing, you know everything”.
"If I know everything, then out with you” was DEVADATTA'S
reply and she kicked him out. While leaving he woefully said:
"Give me some provision for the journey”. He was given two
gold palas and was driven out.

"Thus, oh daughter, he was attended to by DEVADATTĀ even
at the loss of her own wealth; though obstinate he was taken in after
having known that which was secretly hidden, then understanding
his Haridrā rāga, draining him of all his resources he was driven
out. That is about Haridrā rāga. Therefore my daughter, in the
case of a person of Haridrā rāga, without any compunction, even
by extraordinary means it is best to dispossess a man completely.
As by the heat of the sun and so on Haridrā rāga fades, so in the case
of man of Haridrā rāga threatening and the like make him averse,
so without that, by extraordinary means, he should be immediately
divested of his wealth.

“Moreover daughter I have already said that to please a person
you should know his mind.". Listen about it: .
Here in the city of Ujjayinī, presided over by the Lord of the
Beings, Sri Mahākāla, there ruled King VIKRAMĀRKA. By the
valor of his own hands he secured the title of the three worlds. He
had a courtesan called DEVADATTĀ, a jéwel in the armlet of all
the kings. She was as it were the life, the breath, the conscious-
ness, the vitals and all of the Fish-bannered God. She was the field
of good fortune, the abode of charm, the refuge of youth, the place
of arts, the residence of the pleasures of the mansions, and the house
of graces. She was as if created by the creator by putting toge-
ther all the lovely things of the world.
(36) The king having brought under subjection all the enemies
experienced the joy of an unrivalled kingship and protected the whole
earth like one town. He sometimes fought the lords of elephants
which laved the earth by the flow of rut, which competed with the
elephants of Indrá and which in their hugeness mocked the Añjana-
giri. He sometimes rode horses of high breed, which in speed sur-
passed wind; he sometimes practised archery on the parade ground
deafening the directions with the constant twanging of the bows;
he spent his time sometimes by witnessing practice of warfares,
sometimes by thoughts on Šāstras, sometimes by studying the use
of different weapons, sometimes by watersports, sometimes by wan.
derings in the pleasure gardens, sometimes by talking with friends,
sometimes in the company of his beloveds, sometimes by seeing
shows and sometimes by the sport of hunting.

(The king and DEVADATTĀ were conversing on the top of the
palace. The king asked her how her class of persons can win over
by talking, loving etc. She knitted her eyebrows and exhibited her
aversion to the king's enquiries. But to entertain him, she said
that she will only tell him of a wonderful thing she experienced
the other day. While going some distance from the main palace-
gate she saw a gem horse which by its beauty mocked Ucchaiśravas.
He (horse) had beautiful parts (kalā) like the moon «which possess-
es digits»; he had a lovely frontal bone with a lock of curls falling
backwards like the sea «which has lovely conchshells opening on
the right»; he quickly stood on the ground.
: (37) His hoofs were as dark as the indranila jewels; whose
body was rocamāna «possessed of a tuft of hair on the neck»
though virocamāna «very resplendent»; he was handsome as Uccaiņš-

tārkşya «garuda, horse» yet was a hooded serpent had a wide
girth»; he was white as the moon yet as beautiful as coral «possess- :
ed of beautiful long hair»; he was ſuktimān «possessed a cuirl on
the breast» though Śrīparvata «the residential mountain of Lakśmix;
he was, it seemed wind incarnate; the mind embodied; fame incar-
nate of the class of horses. He had not much flesh on the face like
the emaciated shoulder of Vişnu with whom Lakśmi had a love
quarrel; he was broad in chest like garuda; prominent in shoulders,
not in stupidity; small in ears, not in form; hard in hoofs, not in
face; deep in mind, not dull in spirit; soft in hair on the body, not
in bearing lashes of whips; precise in its pace like the blade of
the sword; shining in its complexion and eyes; bent in the neck
and the pacings; quick in speed and understanding; he was made
of all the seasons being fragrant in breath (Vasanta), pure in con-
duct (Summer), a fortunate acquisition of all the riches gained in
conquests (Monsoon), very powerful in conquering others (month:
of Kārtika), huge in form (Hemanta) and cold in all excuses
(Siśira); he was white as the moon yet was Kāla «black, the God
of death». He was the terrible. . . to the circle of enemies on the
borders of battle fields; his greatness was wide-spread; he was skil-
ful in Catuşka; superior in speed; first amongst the fastest; foremost
on pathways; his movements were unobstructed in making rounds;

due to his peace and due to his moving in the skies he was not at-
tached both ways (?); he sat in patience as if covered by a mass of
lustre as white as tagara flowers and as if covered with a cover
of strength out of fear of touching the earth being divine himself;
he looked handsome having created for himself a moving canopy
by the lustre uprising from the saddle studded with various jewels;
having pearls sown in the borders of the saddles like drops of
ambrosia for the propitiation of the eyes of the onlookers; having
a neck looking like the top of the crystal mountain encircled by
rows of clouds on account of it (neck) being girded with a collar
of emeralds; he looked as if his wonderful good conduct was sung
by rows of golden bells on his chest tinkling due to his naturally
moving fore-feet; it appeared that he had spread out his wing as if
for competing with garuda, on account of the slightly handing ga-,
jendrakas on both the sides; he was foremost among the circle of
horses due to his sweet sound like the lord of the Gāndharvas....;
(48) his rear part was covered by the refulgence of various gems
like a portion of the Milky Ocean; (38) the residence of the Goddess
of beauty; the family house of elegance; the abode of good conduct;
and the life of brilliance; he was of a good breed and was very big.
On seeing him I thought 'well, this royal family has various
gems, and in this family which is a refuge of all wonders I have
seen today a jewel of a horse'. But as I was curiously looking at it
I saw a very handsome young man astride it. Then I thought 'in-
deed this man has come to call me and I quickly mounted the
horse. Then the horse was goaded by him and it flew in the sky
that was flooded with moonlight.

a lady?. Am I your slave that I will act as a messenger for you?"
“When I said this he took up the cane in anger and started
beating me. Being tortured thus I frequently said "The feet of king
VIKRAMADITYA, who has conquered the three worlds, are my re-
fuge'. They were perplexed thinking that by my remembering you,
(40) you would indeed come. So they threw me there, and I saw
them running away in confusion. Then I saw myself fallen on the
parade ground. This incident took place this very night".
On hearing the narrative, the king said to her: "DEVADATTA,
is this true?”
DEVADATTĀ said: “If it be untrue then the king may punish
me".
Again the king asked: "Is it true?" "If it is untrue then by the
order of the king I am cursed indeed. As soon as I took the name
of your lordship then the confusion of those running away was such
that I cannot even express it in words. I only heard their words
‘VIKRAMADITYA has come, VIKRAMADITYA has come'. In that
confusion I did not know where the airplane flew away.
Wonderstruck, the king again said: "DEVADATTA, is this.
true?” DEVADATTĀ said just then as if confused, “Sir, it is en-
· tirely true. Why should I speak untruth in the presence of the
king?”
King SAHASĀMKA was pleased, he said: "Oh! Superintendents
of elephants! leaving aside the best of elephants, immediately give
to DEVADATTĀ the second Lord of elephants together with four
crores of gold pieces, rich ornaments and dresses”.
"My Lord," then courteously added DEVADATTA, "this I
shall inform you. Outside the couch this is the one I get. On the
couch I shall take another also. Your lordship asked me before
how my class of persons acquire (wealth). Well, this is how they
do it”. Smilingly she spoke thus and stopped.
Hearing this VIKRAMÄRKA was twice pleased and he said:
"Well done, DEVADATTĀ, well done. I have been enlightened in
a charming manner. The tradition of your class has thus been
elevated to a high state” saying this he doubled his gifts.
Therefore, oh daughter! for those who drain the resources of
men by knowing their minds the gain of wealth is certain. For it
is a great truth that there is nothing a person would not give when
his greatness is glorified.

THE SIXTH TALE OF LAVAŅYASUNDARI
"Moreover, o daughter! for those who try to secure their
object even at the risk of self-sacrifice after taking refuge with a
man of great valour and adventure, the fulfilment of their self-inte-
rests is not difficult. This I told you before, I shall illustrate it to
you now":
(41) "Here there is a town called Ahicchatra, famous in the
world, and presided over by great men like the rich merchants.....
and others. There ruled for a long time king VAJRAMUKUTA enjoy-
ing the pleasures of kingship. He had defeated the circle of neigh-
bouring princes with the support of his ministers in their service
since his father's times, had gradually conquered all the arrogant
enemies and was surrounded by a powerful retinue.
In the same town dwelt also an oilman by name GHUDA who
was in affluent.conditions because of his rich patrimony. He had a
wife named LAVAŅYASUNDARI, young and beautiful, looking like
a play-doll of Madana, the ornament of youth and loveliness even
of loveliness. Her beauty was not unparalleled in her own class of
people, but as it surpassed (the beauty of) all the other women it
was an object of wonder to all the people. Enjoying amorous plea-
sures in her company his days passed happily.
Once while she was in her own house she came within the sight
of the king who was roaming about. Seeing her, as if wonderstruck,
stupefied, infatuated, and helpless due to the striking of the arrows
of Love, he somehow reached his house. He wondered how she
could be obtained, for he would surely not desire to live without
getting her. When he came to know from the spies that she was
the wife of GHUDA, the oilman, he considered how he could bring
him under his subjection. He arrested him under the pretext of
adulteration in oil. Though, he (the oilman) offered to pay fine in
lakhs, he did not free him. On the other hand he tortured him by
inflicting many punishments. LAVAŅYASUNDARI then understood
the king's intentions, and said to her husband: “You must free
yourself by giving whatever fine the king asks of you". According-
ly he said to the king: "Your majesty does not accept even
gold drammas, please tell me then what else should I give you?
Whatever you command I shall definitely give". The king asked
for a hundred elephants knowing that it would be impossible for
him to obtain them. Hearing this the oilman was very much

perturbed in his mind with a series of worries such as Where on
one hand is my caste and where on the other the elephants? There-
for I am totally lost. What is the way out? And what resort?',
LAVAŅYASUNDARI came and asked him what the king had asked
from him. Nervously he said "As I am asked by him to get a hun.
dred elephants my end is near at hand. How will I be ever
released?"
She said: “You accept it, I will get you a hundred elephants".
When the oilman accepted the king's command, the king
thought that he would never be able to obtain a hundred elephants,
therefore she would be in his possession now. Thinking thus he
said “When could you get me a hundred elephants?" Instructed by
her, the oilman asked for six months. The king agreed. The oilman
then said to his wife: “Why did you (42) make me accept such a fine
without the faith (to pay it to him)?” She said to him: "This king is
in love with me and under this pretext wishes to possess me. But it is
an undesirable hope. He is (like) my father. Therefore you must do
what I say, and I shall get a hundred elephants in due time." He
agreed to what she said. “My conduct need not be considered
when it is a question of your (life)”, she added.
• Then taking with her five-hundred best horses and carts, a retinue
adorned with clothes and ornaments of various kinds .......... keep.
ing in mind King SĀHASĀŃKA, the abode of all adventures, she
started for Ujjayinī. After a few days she reached Ujjayini. She
took up her residence on the bank of the Siprā, where the heat of the
sun was warded off by trees and creepers bearing various kinds of
leaves and flowers. She had a rumour bruited about herself
that a courtesan, who in beauty surpassed the damsels of heaven, had
arrived from some place. She distributed gifts adequately to the
suppliant and spent her days in pleasures. She gave hope to the
feudatories and others who came there asserting their superiority by
saying 'I shall do what I can'. But she never accepted anything
from anyone.
As days went by news reached the ears of king SAHASANKA.
Out of curiosity he sent his spies to verify the rumour. When they
reported that it was true, then under the pretext of going on a hunt-
ing he passed by her house. She draped herself in gorgeous robes
and showed herself gracefully to the king. On seeing her he fell in
love with her, and returning from hunting somehow, he passed by
the same path and came to his residence. Reaching home, with his
mind striken by Smara's arrows, he sent his clever and affectionate
entertainer MUKHARAKA immediately to her place. Going there,
meeting her and talking about various things he said after some time

town from the forests; when on the roads only a few travellers were

fierce heat became cool as if pleased at the touch of the evening

rising from the ocean, being surrounded by constellations, and
giving joy to the kumudas, (44) the Lord of the Stars, shone brightly,
destroying the demons in the form of darkness as black as powder-
ed collyrium. When the moonlight produced the fire of love,

cakravākas; which destroyed the darkness pervading the by-paths
and the pride of the haughty women, which agitated the sea full
of waves and the hearts of the lovers, which pained the elephants'
tusks and the minds of the separated ones; and which was being
drunk in on all sides by the families of the cakorakas with their
beaks open and by the eyes of the people and yet was on the in-
crease ...... when such words of the friends clever in bringing
about love quarrels and unions were heard spoken to the proud
women: 'Friend, Madana is irresistible, the mature rays of the
moon are unbearable, youth is shortlived, and the bond of love is
unsteady'; when the lights of the mansions first enkindled were
clearly perceived in the bodies of the separated women like the
reflection of the sparks of the fire of love, when the wanton women
whose hearts were filled with passions sent to their lovers the
messengers forgetting and instructing the messages again and
again, when the ladies wrote the messages of love with the juice
of the musk on the leaves of the ketaki in the lamp of the moon;
when the women looking again and again at the paths of the lovers
decorated their houses; when smoke of the kālāguru încense issued
from the windows of the vāsakasajjās like the measures of the
inflamed fire of love; when the abhisārikās went in all the direc-
tions like the presiding deities of the moonlight, with their bodies
covered with white garments, with the powder of thick ghanasāra
sprinkled over the cheeks, with the pearl ornaments on every limb,
with the whole body anointed with sandalpaste and with their
braids of hair tied with the blooming mālatī flowers. Then the
whole earth was as if expanded with nectar, flooded by the milk of
ocean, made of crystalline stone, made of the lustre of the Dramida
women's teeth recently polished, made from the inner part of the
leaves of the palmtree, be-sprinkled with molten silver and
as if carved out of the tusks of elephants; when it (the earth)
possessed the beauty of the Candraloka, when the moon slowly
whitened the directions and became pure and rose up in the sky,
transferring its own redness to the minds of couples.
At that time the king sent MUKHARAKA to fetch her. She

looking anxiously at the watery clouds, saw him coming. When he
told her of the king's acceptance of her, she was mighty pleased.
She quickly came to the king's palace. When LĂVAŅYASUNDARI
came, the king, full of love, enjoyed amorous pleasures in her com-
pany that night. And in the morning having performed his morn-
ing worship and having finished his meals etc., seated comfortably
and happily, he told the whole affair to BHATTAMATĶGUPTA.
(45) Hearing about it BHAȚȚAMATĘGUPTA said to him:
“Sire different kinds of selfish women move about the earth.
Therefore, your Lordship should not trust them. I know this is har-
lotry". When BHATTAMATŘGUPTA told him thus, he thought 'Do
I not know what is natural love and what is harlotry? Let it be.
What have I to do with it. BHATTAMĀTRGUPTA is venerable,
therefore I shall not say anything. He is always like that. Thus
disregarding him he confidentially spent many days in her company.
But BHATTAMĀTRGUPTA again and again reminded him of
his words. One day while he was thus reminding, the king said:
"Then how can true love be known? When I test her, she does not
even protect herself. On the other hand all signs of love are visible
in her. And I do not notice any aversion in her such as thinking of
some one else even in dreams”. Whe he said this to BHATTAMATķ-
GUPTA, he again said to the king:
"Then your Lordship should test her by rustic methods”. But in
order to test her, as he derided her more and more by such vulgar
methods as cutting of her nails, teeth, and hair, she became more
and more pleased and affectionate. He told BHATTAMATKGUPTA
everything. When he said: “You always scoff her by saying this
is all harlotry, nothing but harlotry, but not a single act of her's is
like that of a harlot,” to him BHATTAMATRGUPTA again
said, "She is a clever rogue that she has produced this illusion in
your Lordship's mind. Now I am convinced that all this is
harlotry."
Through others she knew what BHATTAMATRGUPTA said
(about her) and being always apprehensive looked upon him with
great awe. But once it occurred to her that many days had passed
and the time (of six months) would soon be over. Thus thinking
she came where the king and BHATTAMĀTķGUPTA were talking
and sitting for a moment, said “This is indeed the fruit of your
favour that having come from a distance out of love for your merits,
this person says it is all harlotry. Let it be so. This consideration
indeed is a proper return for my love. It is well that you, a king,
and this one, towards whom you are favourably disposed, are in
unison." The king exclaimed: "Who told you this falsehood? Is

BHATTAMATŘGUPTA like that or myself?” On hearing that, she
smiled a little, stood there for a second and then entering the bed-
room, taking the king's dagger lying on it, severed her head.
Then with his mind full of misgivings VIKRAMARKA entered
within and saw her with the head cut off. As if struck by lighten-
ing, as if enveloped in flames, as if gazed at by a poisonous snake,
he stood there a moment. Afterwards, with due consideration he
called BHATTAMATĶGUPTA inside and said:
“BHATTAMATŘGUPTA! do you see the end of harlotry?" He
said: "Sire, I have seen it. What else shall I say but this, that this
is harlotry too.".
(46) The king was wrathful. Disregarding BHATTAMATŘGUPTA,
making his servants lift her up as she was, he came to the temple of
the Goddess Āsāpurā. VIKRAMADITYA sent his whole retinue
outside and himself prepared to cut off his head. That moment the
Goddess Āśāpurā caught hold of his hand and said:
"Son, O son! do not be rash. You are not an ordinary person,
Why do you put an end to your life out of sheer compassion for
others?”
He answered "Forgive me, Oh Divine One! Please leave off my
hand. I shall present you a desirable offering today.”
The Goddess said: "I am pleased with your extraordinary valour.
Therefore speak, what do you desire?”
VIKRAMĀRKA said to her: "Goddess! Let LAVAŅYASUNDARI
come back to life”. And the Goddess made her alive again.
Happy in mind VIKRAMARKA returned with her to the palace.
Everywhere felicitations were offered and the townsmen were all
very happy. Thus the days of those two, satisfied, happy and deep-
ly attached to one another, were spent.
And now one day, after meals, when the day was practical-
ly at end, when the friend of the lotuses was gradually going
to the western direction, VIKRAMARKA, seated in the ivory
balcony with her, saw a lord of the elephants named RIPUDALANA
who was roaming about at pleasure. The (elephant) was as it were
devouring the orb of the earth by his four feet which bore striking
resemblance to caskets made of black jewels; possessing jewels in
the form of nails as if they were the eighteen extensive islands come
under his feet; looking handsome with his well formed hind-quarter
and shining skin looking like the mansion of pleasures of the God-
dess of Beauty; adorned by strong and well built shoulders as if

they were the doors of the heart, the residence of the Goddess of
Valour; possessing a splendid wide chest looking like an extensive
sea of inviolable beauty adorned with the tossing of fish; due to his
face being thickly covered with swarms of bees falling on account
of the continuously oozing rut it appeared that the Creator made a
dark pit without effort out of mercy for the injury that may have
been done to all the other elephants; which appeared as if possessed
of flames of the fire of anger on account of the spreading lustre of
his pair of eyes as yellow as drops of honey; which looked splendid
with a pair of long, glossy and smooth tusks possessing the com-
plexion of fresh mālati flowers, appearing to be the first two sprouts
of the universally pervaded fame born out of destruction of
herds of intoxicated elephants; decorated with two cheeks as if with
two kula-parvatas which are the source of the wide and continuous-
ly flowing river of rut; adorned with a kumbha (frontal prominence
on the forehead) with something marked on it looking like an auspi-
cious pot adorned with leaves for greeting the Goddess of Victory;
having broad ears imparting broadness to the naturally broad face;
which, because of the skin painted with small red dots (appeared)
as if variegated with the particles of the blood of the enemy's ele-
phants destroyed in many fights, and having waving lobes as if
fanning the cheeks heated by the thick rut; looking fierce with a
thick, gradually thinning, and very long trunk swinging fast, as if
searching for all the herds of elephants on earth; (47) possessing a
pair of temples looking terrific by the ruddy brightness of sindūra
applied to them and looking like the breasts of the Goddess of
Victory red due to the continuous rubbing of kunkuma; making
the single-streamed Yamunā look like the Ganges flowing in three
streams by the constant flow of rut at three places; whose (praise)
is sung by the host of bards in the form of the bees being attracted
by the fragrance of the lake of the ever-flowing rut; having a pair
of beautiful white chowrie-like ear-ornaments, possessing the lustre
of pure white conches looking like embodied fame earned in the
victories obtained in many battles; possessing some indescribable
charm by the broad shoulders with the joints firm, and with smooth
and shining skin; having broad withers, an elevated and curved
bow-like backbone, a well arranged tip of the tail and a very straight,
long and glossy tail. He was pleasant yet terrific, possessing two
tips (of the trunk) fascinating the minds of all people;, ...........;
small in skin, hair on the body, scrotum and the hind quarter; big
in shoulders, trunk and tail; very broad in thighs, withers, hips,
cheeks, corners of the mouth and temples; very symmetrical in the
hind-withers, tip of the tail, sides, belly and thighs; smooth in skin
and hair; deep in mind and roaring; clever in movements and in
rerforming feats; shapely in form and backbone; fragrant in breath

He looks as if made of all the seasons with his eye-ball looking
beautiful like the autumn when sugarcane grows; his might terrific
like the winter which is full of snow; his action violent like the cold
season which produces tremor, and his tip of the trunk moving grace-
fully like the spring when lotuses bloom; his using all the rivers
like summer when all the rivers get dried up, and his roaring deep
like the rainy days when deep rumbling is heard. He conquered
as it were the whole group of heavenly elephants by disregarding
the roar of Airāvata, (the elephant of the eastern quarter), destroy-
ing everyday the glory of Puņdarīka «elephant of south eastern
quarter, day lotuses» by water sports; uprooting the splendour of
Kumuda «elephant of south western quarter, night lotuses»; con-
quering Sārvabhauma «elephant of the northern quarter, all conquer-
ing ones» in many battles; surpassing the lustre of Añjana «elephant
of the western quarter, collyrium»; defeating Puspadanta «elephant
of north-western quarter, sun and moon» by his lovely and refulgent
brilliance; and who put aside the enthusiasm of Vāmana «elephant
of the southern quarter, Vāmana» by the constant grace of taking
three steps. Who bore the beauty of the fourth day(?); who was
charming to the eyes of all people like the state of inebriation, and
who by his excessively fascinating beauty and charm as if satisfies,
fills, expands, pleases and gladdens the eyes.
(48) On seeing it, the king joyfully said to LAVANYA-
SUNDARI after a moment—"My beloved LAVAŅYASUNDARI
ask for anything”. When she was again and again requested
respectfully she said:
“Whatever is yours is mine, what else shall I ask for? But if you
want to please me, then (know) that since childhood I have great
fascination for elephants, therefore give me a hundred such ele-
phants". The King said "This is nothing, ask for anything else
you desire".
Saying this he gave her a hundred elephants.
She said; "Let it be announced that a hundred elephants have been
given to LĀVAŅYASUNDARI”. The king did as he was told.
.. When two-three days passed by, LAVAŅYASUNDARI, fold-
ing her hands said to the king—“Sire, let me take leave of you. I
am a courteşan, Such is our practice”,

about. LAVAŅYASUNDARI gave an account of the whole affair.
The king gave her leave to go. She went back to GHUDA with
the elephants and they lived happily ever after).

There was a brāhmaṇa who in old age begot two sons. When
they grew up they aspired to visit another country. When they
started on the journey the terrible summer set in, with the hot sun
destroying the wealth of beauty of the earth produced by the spring.
When (in summer) the wild cocks hidden in the hollows of old
trees fearing the heat, were slowly crowing; when the decayed barks
of the trees were dropping down as their joints had loosened by the
excessive heat; when small insects in the joints of the barks were
tortured by the intolerable heat; when two or three leaves were
seen ..........; when trees went dry; when the roads were nail-

hot due to the broiling sun; (49) when the shrill screeching of the
ciriţikas deafened the directions as if despising the forest region filled
with the blaze of the hot sun; when the tops of trees were enveloped in
flames enkindled by the breath of aged pythons, which (trees) were
noisy with the tearing of the tough barks as the small worms
tried to enter them, and whose tops were shaken by the wind rais-
ed by the wings of the birds taking flights out of fear; when the
forest-conflagration was blazing everywhere; when the sandy banks
became wavy because the waters were ebbing every day as if the
mature, hot-rayed thirsty sun drunk all the reservoirs after the
fatigue caused by traversing the very long days; when the sapharikā
fish were agitated on seeing the cranes moving near the puddles;
when the young tortoise, exhausted by heat rested under thick
moss; when the reeds were slightly turning dark; when the streams
flowing from the thickets of the mountains thinned down, as if
pained on seeing the beauty of the trees on its sides being destroy-

tortured by herds of huge buffaloes exhaling breath now and then
through the slightly blowing nostrils, continuously scratching their
bellies afflicted with gadflies by the tips of the swaying horns and

stones it seemed the trees were grunting out of helplessness being
exhausted by the heat; when the thirsty fawns with their eyes
closed a little due to tiredness were running here and there with
their necks and ears raised up being attracted by the mirage spread-
ing all round in the lower grounds due to the heat of the rays of
the sun; when some families of monkeys silently sitting on
the branches of the trees, distressed by the fatigue produced by their
own fickle movements, were dragging on the midday drowsiness by
falling down (from the trees), their bodies languid due to the help-
lessness on account of the languor of sleep, were getting up again
and climbing (the trees); when herds of wild boars, as black as
pounded collyrium, with their darkness, doubled by mud, who due
to the fear of the sun frequently rolled their tawny red eyes which
looked like glow-worms in the mass of darkness, were taking resort
in the thickets of mustā on the sides of the ponds; when the birds,
afraid of being drowned in the hot particles of dust entering the
joints of the wings abandoned the paths and hid in the hollows of
aged trees, when the directions were coloured variously by parti-
cles of grass burnt in the forest conflagration resembling iron spikes
(in the hearts) of the travellers produced on account of separation
from their truly loved sweet-hearts; when the sky was laden with
the rustling uprooted particles of the barks of trees; when the wind
was blowing hard and was resonant with the screeching of crickets

of the swinging arjuna flowers and which swept away pieces of
dung.

reached the Vindhya forest of terrifying splendour. Which (forest)
was stretched from the eastern to the western mountain; which was
rendered beautiful by the trees that bore the greenness resembling
the brilliancy of the peacock, which (trees) had their trunks sur-
rounded by bees due to the fragrance of the rut transferred to them
by the scratching of the temples of the intoxicated elephants, whose
roots intermingled with flowers as the branches were broken be-
cause of the swings of creepers made by the sylvan deities, whose

rant with the sweet scent of the ripe fruits hanging on the small
swaying branches slightly crushed by the frolicking monkeys, whose
shades were continuously resorted to by the Kirāta women exhaust-
ed in pitiless sensual sport, whose bowers of creepers resounded
with the shrill singing of the Şidhha women intoxicated by the
honey of the flowers and which (trees) have clusters of fruits and
flowers that could be gathered by hands. (The forests) where creep-

the amorous sport of the Sabara women which had slackened in the
interval of sexual intercourse was enkindled by the cackling of the
gallinules intoxicated by drops of water of the streams flowing from
mountain caves and which were drunk by the clever cātakas with
their beaks; where on the earth covered with the pollen of the pri-
yangu flowers spread by the frisks of the patridges, the footprints
of the sylvan deities were seen; where due to its denseness some

down, losing grip and falling down being perturbed, and getting up

trunks of the elephants; which seemed to be full of foliage due to the
flames of the forest-conflagration; which appeared to be flowery by
the citralaka mixed with pundraka(?); which seemed to be laden

to be laughing by the young ones of the lions at the mouths of the
mountain caves; which seemed to have horripilation on account of
the thorny bamboos; which appeared to have the hair standing on
ends due to the erect kharjūra trees; which was as if engaged in dan-
cing on account of the thousands of sprouts tossed about by the wind;
which seemed to be perspiring in the form of the jaturasa oozing
out from the rocks heated by the sun; which was as if fanned by
the leaves of the high palm trees swayed by the wind; which seemed
to be possessed of speech due to the chirpings of the birds every-
where; where at various places it was throwing out pieces of ele-
phants' dry flesh, drying the hides of the lions and tigers, and keep-
ing tusks of dead elephants; where in some regions the waters of the
streams surpassed the redness of the sun being mixed with the blood
of the travellers put to death; where places under the shades of
the trees were noisy with the quarrels of the travellers with the
caravaneers; where the eaves of the roofs of huts of hay were made
colourful by the peacocks' feathers; where at some places commodi-

made for the blood-stained pearls from the temples of the recently
killed elephants; where the directions resounded with the fight of
the dogs greedily snatching pieces of dry meat of a beast killed near
the caitya tree; where at places heat was dispelled by the flocks of
vultures circling above the flesh of the dead beasts, exhibiting thus
it seemed the sovereign rule of the place of destruction; where the
travellers avoided the settlements of the Bhillas which were inferred
by the sky darkened by the smoke of the continuously cooked meat;

paths, the palates of other travellers were parched, their footfalls

necks turned, they tottered even on the level paths, walked a little

the fear of wild beasts on hearing the rustling produced by their own
feet falling on dry leaves and considered even the short roads long;

ing with bows and two-three wooden arrows, being controlled by their
chiefs who had dark bodies, snub noses, red open eyes, well-built
joints of the bodies, beards formed of two-three hairs, knitted eye-
brows, shrivelled chins, high cheeckbones, small unpierced ears, cur-
ly hairs, and wearing plumages of peacocks; (53) which (forest)
though very quiet was doubly causing fear though the reasons for the
fear such as, wild beasts on the mossy, slippery stones in the streams
flowing from the terrible cavities of the high mountains and the
sounds of various birds were not known; which (forest) was presided
over by mountain villages at intervals, where the boundaries of the
ploughed fields were inferred even from a distance by the delicious
odor of the frying of fresh cakes of grains; where the loud crowing
of the cocks was heard; where the kodrava pounded by the youth-
ful arrogant wives was inferred by the slow creaking of the ma-
chine; where the courtyards of the huts were fragrant with the crush-
ing of cooked barley; on whose dangerous boundaries could be seen
some grass huts pleasant with the songs of the women following the
rhythm of the pestle while pounding rice; where the settlements
which were located near the deep lakes, and which gave solace to
the travellers were difficult to be approached due to the tall bam-
boos; which (forest) was full of thousands of old trees some wither-
ed and some turning dry; which at some places touched the sky with
hundreds of hard and long branches, the interspaces of whose branch-
es were occupied by aged pigeons frequently cooing, whose hollows
were pecked by the wood-peckers desirous of eating small worms,
which because of few leaves and few branches offered little shade,
and which had hardened trunks because of their natural hardness.
In which (forest) were other dense trees on both the sides of the
roads beneath which it was pleasant to live because of the cries of
the peacocks intoxicated at the sight of the untimely dark clouds;
which were always green even in summer as if they had constantly
and in greater measures drawn greenness from other trees and which
drew water from the springs; which (forest) was a place of all mis-
haps; the house of terror, the sister of fear, the abode of difficulties,
the origin of agitation, the cause of tremour, the primary cause of
pain, the residence of wickedness, the land of illusions, the mine of
fatigue, the market of sorrows, the abode of despondency, the climax
of anguish, the mine of the fruits of all bad actions, the cause
for nourishing consumption, the friend of confusion, the bosom com-
panion of miseries and the mother of delusion.
Those two, going through that (forest) with their provisions for
the journey exhausted, spent there seven nights. Afflicted with hun-
ger and thirst they somehow came upon a sweet and pure watered
lake with a banian tree on its bank.... Under the tree they spent
the day. When it was night they enkindled a fire out of fear of

wild beasts and were passing the night keeping awake for a quarter
by turns.
Now, during the third quarter of the night, SOMADATTA, walk-
ing and sitting at intervals, heard a conversation of a pair of pigeons
(by the śrutāśrutanyāya?).
The she-pigeon said: "My lord, for the one that is born, death
is certain. Therefore if death comes about in a glorious way by help-
ing others it is indeed blissful. If these two miserable brāhmaņa
boys, afflicted by hunger and thirst, and who have sought our refuge,
would die here then what would be the purpose of our life? There-
fore, to preserve their life (54) we should sacrifice ourselves”. Hear-
ing this, the pigeon answered: “Well said, beloved. You are indeed
dear to me. Let us do that. Of these two, the one who eats me will be
a king and he who eats you will get five-hundred gold pieces every-
day. This had been predicted by sage Uttanka at the time of our
birth”. Saying this, both of them threw themselves into the blazing
fire.
Having heard this and witnessing the scene with wonder SOMA-
DATTA pulled them out of the fire. Then arousing his elder brother
he told him about the incident of the pigeons, gave him the pigeon
to eat and himself ate the female-pigeon. After eating, he went to
sleep. When he awoke in the morning five-hundred gold pieces were
by his side. Both of them were convinced now, and taking the gold
they proceeded as desired.
Now, as they were going, one of them felt thirsty, and in search
of water he went in a different direction. The other continued the
same way and went a long distance. The former returned after
finding water but lost his way. Thus because of different paths
both of them were separated and went different ways.
Now, according to the story, the elder became a king of Maga-
dha. The other wandering about reached the city of Kāñci. In that
city, which by its splendour surpassed the three worlds, dwelt a bawd
called MAKARADAMSTRA. She had a daughter named KAR-
PŪRIKA. The beasts in the form of the sensuous men who got ,
caught in the snares of her eyes were not able to move even a step.
In amorous sport he spent many days with her. Everyday he gave
her unlimited gold. No supplicant even turned away from him, nor
did his wealth ever decrease though he gave constantly. Seeing his
undiminishing affluence MAKARADAMȘTRĀ said to her daughter:
"Child KARPURIKA! This man basks in wealth yet the source of
his wealth is not known". KARPÚRIKĀ said: “Mother, I also do not
know the source of his wealth". On hearing this MAKARADAM-

ŚRNGÄRAMANJARIKATHA
STRA said: "Oh wretched KARPŪRIKĀ! you are not born of me in-
deed! How can one born of me be just outward-looking? Therefore,
henceforth, you must so engage him and please him that he will tell
you the source of his income".
He was then propitiated by services and sweet talks, and he
narrated the whole incident of the she-pigeon to her. KARPŪRIKA
narrated it to the bawd. Coming to know of it the bawd felt she
had gained a new life, or a treasure or a kingdom. He was then fed
with emetics, so he soon vomitted, and while vomitting threw out
the she-pigeon. Out of covetousness (the bawd) devoured it together
with saliva as soon as he vomitted it. (55) His gain of gold pieces
hence-forward stopped and the bawd's began. Knowing him to be
worthless now, the bawd drove him out under some pretext. With
everything lost but his life, regretting why he ever revealed to her
the affair, he left that city.
While wandering about he heard from some travellers that a
foreigner named VIŞŅUDATTA had become the king of Magadha;
and that he was very pious and charitable. On hearing this he re-
membered the account of the she-pigeon and thinking that this man
must be his brother he went to Magadha. Having gone there he
gave him his own acquaintance and stayed there a few days. Then
taking along with him much wealth he returned to Kāñcī to avenge
his defeat.
He came and gave fees to KARPÜRIKA'S neighbour woman and
began enjoying in her company as before. From the very first day

................................................ ...... ....
Believing him, she asked him: “How did you obtain all this
wealth?"
He answered: “Why do you worry about it? It is a long story”.
But being requested every day he said: "I had gone to the Sriparvata.
There I performed austerities endangering even my life and then ob-
tained this siddhi”.
Once KARPŪRIKĀ went herself with him to the banian tree and
witnessed his affluence. Her desire was then redoubled and grati-
fying him in various ways said:
"I am very eager to possess this wealth. Therefore if I am dear
to you and you have the slightest regard for me, then negotiate a
bargain by accepting the she-pigeon."

SOMADATTA said: "Oh beautiful-bodied one, the attainment of
wealth from the she-pigeon is limited only, while this attainment is
unlimited; how can a bargain be struck between unequal things?”
KARPŪRIKĀ said: “Then take along with it all the wealth
earned by me till now and make an exchange”.
. SOMADATTA said: “What is it that I will not do out of love
for you? Let it be so. Give me the she-pigeon".
Then the bawd who was kept out was called in and making
her emit out (the she-pigeon) by emetics, KARPŪRIKĀ returned
the she-pigeon together with all her wealth in the presence of
witnesses. SOMADATTA also thrice sprinkled water in her
hands and said: "I swear by the three truths, let the siddhi
I attained at the Śrīparvata reside in you”, and washing the
she-pigeon he swallowed it, sent the wealth to his house and
ordering the retinue to remain there as before for five nights, he him-
self went away to his brother.
(56) Now the next day, KARPŪRIKĀ went with the bawd be-
neath the banian tree and crowed like a cock. Then the retinue of
the king served them as before. When five days were thus over, and
price was paid for it, no one came to KARPŪRIKÃ even when she
crowed like a cock. Hoping that they would come she moved at
various places frequently crowing like a cock, but no one turned up
in that direction. Then the bawd said to KARPŪRIKĀ who was
crowing “Daughter, why do you fail thus? When a she-pigeon enters
a house this is always the result”.
And her maid servants said to her: "Madam, when you give one
thing and take another, then both perish”. All of them were dis-
appointed, and with their faces downcast like themselves they
returned home.
SOMADATTA returned to his brother who was ruling at Maga-
dha and lived happily.
Therefore, o daughter, dhūrtas should never be troubled. For
when they are troubled they act in such a way that they vanish after
taking even the previously earned wealth. .

THE EIGHTH TALE OF THE LOVE OF A WOMAN
I shall now illustrate to you what I told you before that one
should always protect oneself from love as from a tiger, Listen.
In the town of Pundravardhana that outshines Alakā by its
heavenly mansions, gardens, tanks, lakes, and its rich and great men,
there lived a wealthy merchant called VASUDATTA. After observ-
ing vows and offering prayers a son was born to him who was named
RATNADATTA. Being the only son he was a spoilt child. The
father sent him to a teacher called VASUBHŰTI for studies. Being
naturally gifted with the power to retain what was once read,
in short time he learnt all the lores, and mastered all the arts. He
obtained great distinction in the training and care of elephants, the
methods of handling horse-vehicles and the care of horses, the art
of business, the secrets of gambling, the science of harlotry and the
art of painting, cutting leaves, binding books and so on.
Once when he had grown up into a young man he said to his
father: "Father, by your favour I have learnt all the lores, I have
mastered all the arts, and have known all the sciences. But it is in-
deed shameful for me now to pass my days expending your wealth.
(57) Therefore give assent that I may earn wealth by my own hands”.
When he spoke thus his father tried to persuade him in many ways
but he did not stay back. He did not even accept the money offered
to make a start. He took only one thousand gold pieces with him
and followed by his servant SUBANDHU, set out to work. He con-
sidered his family's means of earning wealth censurable, and there.
fore decided to earn wealth by serving a Sovereign king. With that
determination he set out to join the services of king PRATAPA-
MUKUTA, the ruler of Mānyakheța. His servant SUBANDHU,
taking along with him his sword 'Vasunandaka', followed him. On
the way he said to RATNADATTA: “Though your father offered you
a large sum of money, you accepted only this meagre amount for
provisions on the way. How will we be able to join the king's ser-
vices? And how will we maintain ourselves on the way? To him
RATNADATTA replied: "I have taken this amount in case of an
emergency, not for provisions on the way. The provisions during the
journey will be the arts, the lores, and the sciences that I have learnt;
the wealth of the gamblers in gambling is mine, the wealth in the
mansions of the prostitutes is mine; I shall maintain myself on that.
This I swear that if I am seen by the courtesans they will surely call
me, and will not send me away. If they do not call me or if they
send me away then I will give up my life.” So saying he proceeded
further with SUBANDHU.

Travelling thus they reached the city of Vidiśā. There, in Bhāilla-
svāmidevapura, lived a famous courtesan named LAVAŅYASUN-
DARĪ of unparalleled charm, whose fortune was in offering arghya
(to Gods). She was the resort of Beauty; the one fruitful objective
of a youthful age which is the place of Smara's pleasure, she looked
like a lotus-pond with a lotus on one side over which hovered rows
of bees brought by soft wind, on account of her forehead on which
rested the carefully arranged fascinating curls; she looked like the
bow of Smara, bent due to the tightly tied string, due to her creeper-
like eyebrows slightly curved in grace; she was like a lotus plant
with the buds frequently opened by soft wind on account of the
meaningful glancing of the immature grace of love; she looked
like a lavali-creeper with lightly ripe fruits on account of her cheeks
possessing fresh charm; she was like a foot of the Malaya mountain
with delicate sandal sprouts cropping up due to her lovely neck; she
looked like Madana's sporting tank due to her beautiful hands that
gathered loveliness every day; she was like the pleasure lotus-pond
of Madana with the small buds opening due to her captivating erect
breasts, who was like the river of Smara with moss floating over
the small waves due to the three folds (on the abdomen) on which
the line of hair had slightly grown; she was like the swing of Madana,
with it's plank spread out due to her hips expanding gradually; she
was like the soil of Smara's pleasure-garden with two lovely plan-
tain trees whose beauty spread in all the directions due to her pair
of well-shaped thighs whose beauty was slowly appearing; (58) she
seemed to be a land-lotus with a blooming lotus on it due to the conti-
nuously increasing natural redness of her feet; she seemed to be
possessed by a genius that is found in people of her class and she
captivated even the minds of the shrewd people.
She had come there to dance in her turn before the God. The
same moment he also came there with a desire to behold the God.
LAVANYASUNDARI saw him who entered like an intoxicated ele-
phant and who destroyed the pride of Kandarpa by his own hand-
someness. At the first sight he entered her heart together with the
arrow of Manmatha. She was immediately caught in the spell of
love and fell down on the ground, in a feat of unconsciousness... But
in a moment, she somehow regained consciousness and gave å false
excuse to the dancing teacher that her head was aching. Her friend
BAKULIKĀ understood her pretense and shielding her said to the
dancing teacher: "She had already told me that her head was aching,
therefore allow her to go home, I will dance in her turn". Saying
so she (BAKULIKA) sent her (home). After dancing in her turn
-BAKULIKA came and sat down besides her. She enquired after her
health and said smilingly: “Friend LAVANYASUNDARI! You al-
ways laughed at us and said that we were like hogs. What is this

now? We are more refined, for we accept a man's company only
after knowing his charms and conduct. You are meritorious
indeed that without knowing the man's place of residence, conduct
and wealth you have fallen in love with him at first sight, and have
been reduced to this condition", Hearing this LAVAŅYASUNDARI
said: “You have done well to retort thus. It accords with my pride,
good fortune and intoxication of youth. But you do not realise that
it is not proper to speak such jocose and cutting words to me whose
vitals are stung now. Is this the fruit of your friendship? Yet, you
may do what you think fit”.
When thus spoken to, she (BAKULIKA) said: "What would be
the use of my friendship if I do not act as you desire?"
LAVAŅYASUNDARĪ said: “You consider this to be an easy
matter. But, friend, it is difficult indeed. Because, on seeing him
you will satisfy your own desires and will forget mine."
Hearing this BAKULIKĀ said: “Friend, his handsomeness might
lead me to do so, still have faith in me, I shall definitely bring him
and unite him with you."
...So saying she embarked upon her mission. She thought that a
stranger could be found only at two places, if a student in a monas-
tery, if a prince in deserted temples, so she first looked for him in a
lonely temple. (59) There she saw him sleeping. being waited upon by
his servant. She said to his servant: “It is not proper for the fortu-
nate to sleep during the evening. Your friend looks to be a fortu.
nate man, therefore wake him up.” The servant woke him up. She
said: "O visitor! whence do you come?” RATNADATTA replied: “I
have come from another country and shall go to join the services of.
the sovereign king”.
After a moment BAKULIKĀ started weeping. RATNADATTA
enquired: “Good one, why do you weep?” She said: "I had a brother
who looked exactly like you. His memory brought tears to mine
eyes. You too are my brother". "It is true, but your brother was
instrumental in expending your wealth, I will stand by you as a
brother in difficulties”, he said.
"Then come to my house. Be my guest,” BAKULIKA said and
brought him to LĀVAŅYASUNDARI'S house.
LAVAŅYASUNDARI was standing on the terrace of her house
with a poisonous bulb in her hand, and while she stood there think-
ing: 'I do not know whether today I will lose two things at a time or
gain my end? If BAKULIKA takes him to her house then my friend
is out of my hands and he also goes his desired way, I will die

then.'--BAKULIKÁ, understood her design and brought him to her
house.
When LAVAŅYASUNDARI saw them coming, she was a little
pleased and queried: "BAKULIKĀ, who is this guest?” When
BAKULIKA answered, "My brother”; her doubts filed and while
offering him a seat she thought she had gained her end. When
BAKULIKA said: “Welcome my brother”, she gave him a warm re-
ception by giving him a bath, meals etc. according to her wealth and
love.
Evening passed and BAKULIKĀ went to her house. She led
RATNADATTA to bed, and perceived then that his talents, charms
and virtues were a hundred times more than his handsomeness. In
that single night she was so pleased that abandoning all thoughts
of another man she became attached only to him.
When the night came to an end, when the gloom (of the night)
and the stars seemed to vanish at the command of the incompre.
hensible Lord of Time; when the clusters of stars which outshone
big pearls disappeared like hail-stones; when the red-glow of the
moon on the setting mountain illuminated the sky; when the sky
possessed the beauty of the sandy bank of the sea glowing with the
rays of the pearls and then reddened by the flashing rays of the
creepers of coral; when the directions which were dipped in the
darkness of the night like the temples of the she-elephants, were
rendered tawny by the rays of the sun piercing through the dense
darkness now moving away; (60) when the sky in one quarter possess-
ed darkness as grey as the wings of a pigeon, on the other side was
variegated with the rays as red as the slightly ripe kuvalaya fruit,
elsewhere was spread over by the thin rays of the moon which was
as pale as the ripe leaves of the palmtree; on one side were the
vanishing stars, and at some places were a few constellations
shining, not concealed behind the lingering darkness; when the
morning breeze blew softly, as if due to the fatigue of constant
motion, occasionally faltering on the open Puņqarikas, turning grey
with the pollen of the garden flowers, and drinking, due to thirst,
the drops of the perspiration of exhaustion of the couples tired in
love sport by gaining entrance through the windows of the man-
sions; when the crowing of the cocks which issued falteringly from
the throats due to drowsiness, which was the drum of auspicious-
ness fell frequently on the ears, announcing the end of night and
the entrance of the Glory of the Day, and which was a chant for
breaking the knot of pride of the proud women when the loving
couples with their hearts still attached to each other but their hands
separated from embraces still desire to sleep due to the stupor
produced by the pain of pitiless sexual intercourse; when the lotus-

es, the pleasure-mansions of Laksmī, had their doors opened by the
doorkeepers in the guise of the bees who were first within then,
by the keys in the form of the rays of the sun; when the drops of
dew as cool as the flakes of snow, settling unnoticed, produced dull-
ness in the bees whose wings were heavy due to the pollen of
flowers, who were desirous of flying out from the inner parts of the
flowers and who were slowly humming as their sleep had just been
broken; when the tops of the trees were resonant with the twitter-
ings of the flocks of birds just arisen, with their eyes partially
open as the eyelids were heavy with sleep, who frequently fluttered
their wings yearning to stretch their limbs cramped in sleep; when
gradually opened out fully but slowly according to the regular
order of maturity, first the loose outer petals falling out as their
joints gave way, then the top opening making visible the drops of
honey frozen by the dew, and then becoming manifest the inner
cups as the petals opened out, as if for setting into motion the ses-
sions of honey-drinking for the bees; when the clusters of kumu-
das became dark as if unable to bear the rise even of Mitra (sun),
the one eye of the three worlds, and the only one capable of des-
troying darkness, thus acting according to the virtues of their names
and place of origin «born of water, dullness»; when the pleasant-
faced wives in the form of directions flashed by a red glow, as if
anointed with kunkuma, on coming to know of the arrival of the sun
after a long journey; when the she-cakoras with their eyes closed due
to the langour of sleep and beaks open resorted to the bejewelled
pleasure-balconies moving slowly due to the satiation of drinking of
the moonlight throughout the night, after quickly leaving the sky
where the gates of darkness were closed by a light as red as heaps of
sindūra powder and pushed forward by the wind; when the vision
of the family of owls who can see only at night was as if screened
by darkness even though there was light, useful in manifesting all
things, like that of the wicked people who see only faults; (61) when
the pairs of cakravāka-birds quickly came together even from a dis-
tance, abandoning their liking for the tanks of lotuses as if it were
a play of destiny; when the lustreless lamps were extinguished and
removed from the houses, like the yogis who due to detachment
turn away from their houses and resort to liberation; when the
morning breeze, reddened by the drops of honey mixed with the
fallen filaments of the soft opening lotuses, cooled by the contact
of the drops of water thrown up by the flutterings of the wings of
the female cakravākas' eagerness to be united, and pleased by the
humming of the bees awakened by the slow swinging of the flower-
creepers of the garden, entered the cavities of the ears of the amo-
rous women tired due to excessive sexual inter-course; when
the puņdarīkas gave the illusion of a cluster of the red lotuses as

their petals were tinged with the lac-like lustre of the morning sun;
when for a moment the clustres of kumudas in the depths of the
lakes created the illusion of indivaras due to the lingering dark-
ness; and when the whole world was as if brought to life, made to
breathe and awakened by the sun which brightened the whole
earth, which destroyed darkness, which was red like the open pome-
granate flower and which had attained the position of a crest jewel
on the rising mountain, (he made) SUBANDHU tie five hundred
pieces of gold to a corner of a coverlet and said to her maid that
she may search for the same. From there he went to the gambling
house to play dice.
When LAVAŅYASUNDARI woke up in the morning and en.
quired of the maid about him, the maid replied: "I do not know
where he has gone. While leaving he asked me to search for the
coverlet”. And when the maid found it, LAVAŅYASUNDARĪ saw
five hundred pieces tied to its corner and she said: “The talented
one is not only handsome, but is generous too. Where can gold,
and that too fragrant, be found?” When BAKULIKĀ came she said:
"Dear friend, he has gone away somewhere, please search for him”.
BAKULIKA mounted a she-mule and with her retinue went to the
gambling house.
She saw him there playing boldly amongst the rich men. She
knew that many women are under the power of gamblers and so
stood there silent. After some time when he saw her he said:
"Sister, how long have you been here?"
"Since a long time” she said. “It is not proper for people like
you to come to such places” he said and defeating the opponent, he
asked the keeper to make an account. When the keeper said he
had won fifty thousand drammas, he said: “Give to my sister four
hundred drammas for tāmbūla and send sixteen thousand to
LAVAŅYASUNDARI”. Then distributing ten thousand in charity
he came to LAVAŅYASUNDARI’S place with BAKULIKA.
According to her standards he spent the whole day taking his
bath, food and so on. At night after enjoying his company
LAVAŅYASUNDARI said affectionately: “Where (62) do you
come from? and where do you wish to go?” He told her from where
he had come and said: “In the morning I shall go and recruit in the
services of the sovereign king PRATĀPAMUKUTA”.
"If you are going to earn wealth, know that I am rolling in
riches, you may spend them. You may do whatever you wish to
do after they are all expended." "In case of a person like you, the
body alone is serviceable, not wealth, that is indeed given. There.
fore I will certainly go tomorrow.”

Next day, she went to a bawd called DHOŅDĀ and said
"Mother, I will not disobey your words, but I will not be able to
live once he is gone, therefore tell me what should I do?” The
bawd made many efforts to dissuade her from going, but when she
did not comply, the bawd thought: 'Well, be it so. The delicate one
will herself get tired after going some distance and will return'..-
and permitted her to go, adding “All right, I will also come with
you".
LAVAŅYASUNDARI and the bawd accompanied RATNA.
DATTA. Travelling slowly, after many days they came to the town
of Pūrņapathaka. Outside the town, under a mango tree, RATNA.
DATTA slept placing his head on the lap of LAVAŅYASUNDARI.
When the servants went to the town to bring food, it occured to the
bawd that LĀVAŅYASUNDARI seemed determined to go with him
therefore she must make a plot to file a complaint with the king, get
him killed, and take her back to town. Accordingly, collecting
flowers she went to the king SÜRADHARMAN and informed him
"Sire, in my youth, after my bath on the fourth day you had sexual
union with me. Of that a daughter was born to me. As she was
born of you, she is lovely indeed. At present, she is being lured
away by a thug. Therefore I have come to inform Your Majesty,
You can do what you think fit.”
"Immediately arrest him who has cheated my daughter," the
king ordered the police officer. When the officer went there with
his soldiers he saw a very handsome youth sleeping, his head placed
tenderly on the lap of the happy-looking LAVAŅYASUNDARI.
Seeing him the police officer thought; 'It seems love prompts her to
go with him. She has not been deceived. The bawd seems to be
a liar. Let me wait till his sleep lasts. I will enquire when he gets
up.' But as the police-officer delayed the king said:
“Why does the officer delay?"
"Sire, I have told you that he is a great cheat. He has cheat-
ed even the police-officer,” the bawd replied. The king then sent his
vassals. (63) They heard the account from the police officer, thought
him to be right and stayed on. "What is this, that they also delay"?
the king queried. “Sire, they are also deceived by him, therefore
please go yourself. But be careful, for he cheats all whom he sees".
The king made due preparations and went himself.
When LAVAŅYASUNDARI saw the king, she awakened RAT-
NADATTA and said: “RATNADATTA you told me that you can
fight sixty-four men with a 'kaditalla' standing, thirty-two men sit-
ting and sixteen men lying down. Now is the time. I did not wake

you up till now thinking that these men are few. Now you may do
what you think fit”. “Well done,” he said and taking his sword
'Vasunandaka' in hand, he rushed towards them regarding them as
worthless as grass.
When the king beheld his valour and LĀVAŅYASUNDARI'S
love, he understood that she was not cheated, for those who are
cheated look quite different; that the wretched bawd was a liar and
by this plot wished to destroy him and that the girl was willing to
go with him out of love. He thought his presence would lead to
RATNADATTA'S death, therefore he went home and sent his
doorkeeper to fetch him and thought-"fortunate indeed will be
that man whose footman he will become".
The doorkeeper went to RATNADATTA and told him that
king SURADHARMAN wanted him. He went and without saluting
the King's feet he met him. The king offered him a seat, tāmbūla
etc, and respectfully asked: "Good one, where have you to go?
Which country have you left? Which would you adorn?"
"I go to recruit in the services of the sovereign”, he said.
"If it is not inexpedient then stay here for some time. I have
forty-eight thousand villages. You may take half of them”. Though
thus addressed respectfully, he did not agree. The king therefore
entertained him with due honour and allowed him to go.
He came to LAVANYASUNDARĪ. Meantime the bawd came
and said: "Son, I welcome you. You are a handsome man, a clever
conversationalist and a generous donor to the supplicants. This was
only an effort of mine to find out whether your valour was on par
with your other virtues. And you are more distinguished in valour
than in the other virtues. I am indeed fortunate in having such a
son-in-law. ...
(With LAVANYASUNDARI RATNADATTA proceeded towards
Mānyakheța, and took up residence with a courtesan named CITRA-
LEKHA. (64) Next he took leave of LĀVAŅYASUNDARĪ for four
days and went in search of a job. It was difficult for her to bear the
separation. The same day while she was seated in the terrace with
CITRALEKHĀ the king saw her. He looked at her a long time
and knew that she did not belong to this place. He sent his men to
LAVAŅYASUNDARI but she refused. Observing that she was de-
voted to another person, the king's messenger) started weeping.
CITRAKEKHA asked: “Good one, why do you weep?”
"It seems to me that two things will perish."

Again she queried “What is that?" He said: "This lady has been
seen by the king, and he has told me that I should take her to the
king. If she comes noț, her ears and nose would be cut off and I
would be killed.” Hearing these words LĀVAŅYASUNDARI was
alarmed. CITRALEKHÃ asked her to go to the king for RATNA-
DATTA was away for four days. And she could keep her necklace
there. In the evening she reluctantly went to the king's palace.
The king enjoyed her (company). In the early morning when she
returned to her place, the king sent with SANGAMAKA one lakh
drammas along with rich garments as a gift, of which she took
only seventeen gold pieces.
"What is this? It is wonderful”-SANGAMAKA exclaimed.
She said: “I will only take my wages. (65) I will accept all this only
on the condition that the king would allow me to go away at my
will.” When SANGAMAKA narrated it to the king and the king
accepted her condition, she accepted the gifts and disbursed them
among the supplicants. She thus passed three days in the company
of the king.
The following day the king called her to show her folk dancing.
She knew it was the day of his (RATNADATTA'S) return. She
dressed up, instructed her maid to stand near the elephant's post
and show her the necklace as soon as RATNADATTA was seen
coming. She went to the palace, and the king said "Show us some
folk dancing." She said “all right” and started dancing. Now
while the dance was going on, she took a step backwards and saw
her maid standing near the elephant's post. She looked at the king.
The king understood her intention and as he said "you are free.”'
With her hair dishevelled she hurried back to her house.
Her behaviour made the king curious. He said to SANGA-
MAKA: "What sort of man is he whom she loves madly, that giving
up our shame she lets herself go like this?” With a desire to see
what was happening he followed her and as he was looking through
the latticed window he saw RATNADATTA coming. LAVANYA-
SUNNDARI approached him with a water-vessel to wash his feet.
Seeing her differently attired RATNADATTA said to SUBANDHU:
“Good SUBANDHU, while we are talking about the news of the
house, water has entered,” and he said to her; “LAVAŅYASUNDARI,
do not wash my feet. You are my mother." She asked pointedly,
"RATNADATTA, what is this?” “What else? You are the wife of
my master. Enough of this, please sit down.”
The king said to SANGAMAKA "Friend, did you hear his
words? His modesty outweighs his grace. Well, we will reveal
ourselves.” So saying, leaving the latticed window, he desired to

71
enter by the door. But RATNADATTA was aware that the king
was coming, so saying "Sire, proceed carefully," he threatened him
with the sword in hand. The king said: “You spoke differently with
her, and now these words, what does it mean?” “You are my brave
attendant(?) Therefore this only is proper. I am the master of my
beloved and wife. It is not proper for you to wait here. Your
majesty may go to his royal palace. I have come to attach myself
to your Majesty. I will do whatever you order me to do after I
come there." Pleased with his valour and his conduct the king (66)
said: "Good, very good, I will do whatever you say." And he went
to his palace.
After going, he sent his doorkeeper with a she-elephant to fetch
him. He was brought with great honour and was allowed to enter
even as mounted, and was welcomed with the offer of a seat, tāmbūla
etc. by the king himself.
The king then asked: “What do you know?"
He answered: “All the śāstras, all the arts, all the sciences. I re-
member what I hear once. Please see a wonder now. Let four
narrators tell stories. I shall play with dice. If I forget my turn,
if there is no tāmbūla, or if I forget the stories then say I do not
know anything.”
The king was curious to see and he started doing what was sworn.
Meantime LAVAŅYASUNDARI thought: ......

....... Never defeated in battles, frequently freeing himself from
debts, enjoying the pleasure of the king's favour he lived happily

two forest lords, twenty-four Kārvațas, twenty-one Konkaņas and
people of thirty-six ports. Of that king, who by his valour had
subjected the circles of kings and had conquered all the feudatories,
there was a famous courtesan named ASOKAVATI, who was very
rich and was the one abode of beauty, youth and graces. All the
feudatories gave everything to her ....... and looked up to her
expectantly. She'accepted everything from them and gave it to a
feudatory called CHADDALAKA. He was dearer to her than her
life and was also a favourite in the king's court. She had mastered
the world-famous sword-dancing.
Once in winter when nights were very cold and it was impos-
sible to sit outside ..... (67) king SAMARASIMHA, seated in the
middle of the pleasure pavilion, giving seats to those desirous of see-
ing the dance-performance, sent for AŚOKAVATI. (In the winter)
when intolerable autumnal sun became a little bearable; when the
net-work of the beads of perspirativn from the cheeks of the protec-
tress of rice-fields is removed; when the wind is laden with particles
of snow; when swarms of bees are attracted towards the buds of the
śyāmā-creepers after giving up the ponds of kuvalayas whose beauty
were destroyed by snow flakes; when the lotus-ponds without the
Autumn looked like the women separated by their lovers, with the
lustre of the lotus-faces faded, with bare stalks as ornaments, bear-
ing paleness in the form of the flakes of snow on the water, and

seeing his quiver of arrows exhausted after breaking the hearts of
the separated lovers, tied the fresh sugarcanes as bows to conquer
the world, which (sugarcanes) were as charming as the cheeks of
the young Kerala women; when in the pleasure-mansions, the hair
of the doe-eyed women which were fragrant with the fresh maru-
vaka flowers and whose shine was doubled with the fragrant oil
inferred from its perfume, enchanted the minds of all the loverlorn
persons; when the couples desired the warmth of kunkuma having
given up the anointing of the sandal paste which was cherished in
autumn; which brought about the delicious touch of the breasts
of the beloveds which were scented with the constant appli-
cation of the slightly burnt ghanasāra, and which were fully per-
fumed with the kālāguru; when the lovers constantly resorted to
the fire of pleasures; when the wind was heavy with particles of
thick frost fallen on the borders of the clusters of partially open
kunda-buds appearing to be their smiles of wonder on seeing the
bees leaving the priyaka flowers, whose honey-juice had been
exhausted, and quickly alighting on the Howers of the priyangu
creepers; when in the whole world loving couples had taken to the
vow of Ardhanārīśvara as their limbs were in close embraces.

youth, due to the kunda flowers opened by the bees, mixing with

sorted to the southern direction fearing the cold; when the travellers

the warmth of the breasts of their beloveds; when the perishing
lotus-tanks turned white as the lotuses faded on knowing that Mitra,
their sole joy-giver, had become a traveller of the southern direc-
tion; when the fields were as if overspread with emeralds due to
their being continuously covered with a parrot-like splendour of
the blades of the rich corn; when the wanton women put on warm
petticoats and appeared to have taken a vow of winter with their
charming braids of hair dressed with rare perfumed oil, with their
lips daubed with too much wine, and with their bodies turned

breasts were adorned with garlands of the partially open priyangu
buds, whose fleshiness were covered with fresh rodhra powder and

the beauty of Kälindi's stream marked with balls of foam due to
their having small fruits in between tops and covered with clusters
of flowers possessing emerald-like green lustre, looking like leaves

She put on excellent apparel and adornments adequate
for the performance and proceeded towards the royal palace.
She thought to herself: "If the lord of my life does not
see this then my dressing and dancing would be futile. And if
these would be seen by CHADDALAKA then I would offer to
God flowers and kunkuma both worth five-hundred. On the way
she vowed this to God Ganapati, the fulfiller of desires. Ther
thinking that he is bound to be there, with her heart full of joy
she went (to the palace) and began dancing. Dancing with rhythm
and grace, as she glanced in all the directions she did not
see CHADDALAKA. Instantaneously strength left her, enthusia-
sm waned, her face paled and she became lifeless. The dancing
teacher was quick to perceive that she was continuing dancing
without grace because of the shame of the king, (69) the feudatories
and other persons. But this dance was very dangerous, and needed
good balance. Because she was continuing dancing without bal-
ance, he was afraid she might therefore throw herself on the sword,
and that would be an end of the excellent person. So he informed
the king "She was gracefully dancing uptil now thinking that her
lord will see it. But being aware that he is not here, she has be-
come indifferent and graceless, and is dancing only out of shame,
thus she will throw herself on the sword. You may have got angry
with me that though knowing I did not tell you about it, now Your
Majesty can do what he thinks fit.” Hearing this the king loudly
said: "Oh Dancing Master, it is late in the night, please stop the
performance". Then waiting a moment he went to his bed room,
and called AŚOKAVATI there, and said: “You wretched one! you
were not ashamed of me, nor of those acquaintances of ours, the
feudatories and others. You have become very shameless. The
conduct of courtesans even is not like this, what is this?” She
said: "Sire, I am known, what shall I hide? There is nothing that
is not done for the sake of love. For my graceless dancing Your
Majesty may punish me or decorate me, you have all powers”. To
her the king said: "The desire to sin does not secure riches. Do
not be so bold again." Saying thus he sent her away. He sent
spies to find out what she would be doing now. From the royal

(The king sent for another handsome youth called SUNDARAKA
to break this bond of love.)
He sent him a gift. On hearing from his servants about the king's
gift and the person who called on him SUNDARAKA talked to his
friends thus. "Where on one hand is the king and where on the
other are we? And what can be the reason of sending this gift
and the caller?' From amongst his friends one said: "Kings
are full of curiosity. There must be some purpose in calling you.
Some one must have told him about you. Therefore accept the
gift and welcome the man who has come to summon you”. He
said: "I will do so" and accepting the same, (bowing) his head, he
said to the callers “What is the order of the king?” They said:
"The king has heard of your fame. He is curious, so we have been
sent to summon you, therefore please come”. When they said
thus, he started with them at leisure. Thus travelling, followed
by thirty-two beautiful, rich and young harlots and thirty-two
woman who announced time, after some days he reached the town
of Uragapura.
Now, the following day, from afar the good news were spread.
And he, whose handsomeness and youth were intently observed by
the king, saw the king seated in the hall. He bowed to the king,
and the king talked with him. He was given tāmbūla and a seat near
him by the king with his own hands, and was seated with great
respect. After a while he said: (70) "The time has come for the pur-
pose for which you have called me. Therefore tell me what is to
be done".
Smilingly the king said: “You know the affair, now do what
you think is proper.” “There is no doubt about it. If your majesty
orders, it shall be done. But there it is only a body without life.
even I shall place even my life in it and see what can be done.” Say-
ing this he bowed to his feet and went out.
Then he sent his retinue to the residence given by the king,
and followed by four 'Tuļitālas', putting on an attire fit for the
occasion he roamed in the locality of the courtesan. The harlots
vied with each other in calling him by offering him everything,
but giving hopes to all and pleasing them, he came to the doors of
ASOKAVATI. There he stood talking sweetly with his men and
was seen from afar by the bawd MAKARADAMȘTRĀ and
AŚOKAVATI behind her, sitting on the mattavāraṇaka. On

seeing the sixteen years old youth who surpassed Manmatha in
beauty and charm, she remarked to her mother: "Mother, this
youth does not belong to this place. He seems to be a stranger,
and is possessed of all surpassing handsomeness, youth and charm".
The mother recognized her love at first sight, and having obtain-
ed such a chance after a long time, quickly said: “Daughter,
this earth is indeed praiseworthy. Here are found men more
handsome than the handsome, more fortunate even than the
fortunate and attachment to one man is made to withdraw by other
men, therefore call him". When this was said she, who felt great
attraction for him on merely seeing him called hir: "O, Guest,
why don't you come in?” Hearing it he said: "Surely I will
come” and gracefully and handsomely he came to her. On seeing
him she was agitated, dumb, and intoxicated. Giving up all else,
taking her bath, making him take a bath, dining with him at one
place according to her standard, she went to bed. SUNDARA then
sent his servant to bring a pattanika from the king and kept it
with him. Then he started entertaining her according to his skill,
so much so that she did not know whether it was a dream or magic.
SUNDARA exciting her sensuousness drew on her body with his
nails some modes of sexual union, at some place designs of leaves,
at some place Bhārata, and another Rāmāyaṇa, while so doing he
recorded the images of the nail-scratches into the pattanikā.
When she retired from dalliance, she quickly felt as if arisen
from sleep, ........... as if awakened from a fainting spell, as if
freed from stupefaction, delusion and infatuation caused by some
stupefying herb. And she thought: “What have I done? Ah! the
sport of wretched Destiny is unsurpassable, the things fated cannot
be over-stepped, Destiny cannot be violated, that ...... this is
the end of my love. Therefore, definitely Destiny cannot be tres-
passed. I was not even brought to my senses by that sinner whose
mind is intent on wealth”. Thus thinking ........ the night pass-
ed (71) and the sun rose. SUNDARAKA knowing her heart that was
full of repentance ..... giving (the pattanikā?) to the king said:
“Sire, I have followed your command.” Hearing this the king was
pleased ....... gave him as a gift the lordship of four-thousand
villages.
But since then in the same manner ..... she lived in despair.
The king taking the pattanikā .... came and said to
CHADDALAKA: "Spread this and accept it as a gift".
Then the Mahattama TIKKAPAIKA said: “What is this?"
CHADDALAKA replied: “This is a plan of the king to break our
bond of love". And when he saw the pattanika after spreading it.

Even then, (he said), “my love will not be changed by these

house and showed himself to AŚOKAVATĪ. On seeing him she
said to her mother: "Mother is this man not similar to TIKKA-
PAIKA?” and sent her servant to fetch him. When he was sent
for and he came, recognizing him to be TIKKAPAIKA, she said:

no parting of those two. By my own wickedness, producing an
infatuation in her mind I brought about this end. Therefore it is
only proper that I give up my life”. Though the king enlightened
him in many ways he threw himself into the fire together with his
wives and retinue.

THE TENTH TALE OF THE SNAKE
(73) Moreover child, when men are harassed very much there
is nothing they would desist from doing out of anger. Listen, my
child:
In the city of Kausāmbi, which was like a jewel on the parting of
the hair of the Lady Earth, there lived a rich śrotriya named ŚRUTA-
DHARA who had mastered all the lores. He who followed the path
laid down by the śrutis and the smộtis, begot a son in the middle age
who was named VINAYADHARA. Since boyhood the boy was ini.
tiated into the study of Vedas and by the time he was sixteen he had
learnt all the sõstras.
Now, once upon a time, when spring, the sovereign of seasons
set in, enkindling the sun which was like its greatness incarnate,
after pushing aside out of compassion the winter season which afflict-
ed the whole world by extreme cold; when the orb of the moon
posssessed the beauty of a white umbrella with the cloth in the
form of the moonlight, with the ribs in the form of the bright rays
and which was held high by the umbrella bearer in the form of the
night; where here and there leaves of excellent saffron were sway-
ed by the softly blowing wind; when the white lotuses bore the
beauty of white chowries; when the rows of aśoka trees flashed
forth sprouts in every forest like banners (woven) by the shuttle
dyed in lac of the Fish-bannered One who conquered the whole
world; when the campaka trees had not even put forth buds, when
sprouts had not cropped up, when the fragrance of the kesara had
not spread, when the trees and the creepers had not become even
mature, when the directions were not even clear, when the wind
was not even slow and when the humming of the swarms of the
bees was not even heard, then, at the first appearance of spring,
even without cause, the world was agitated; when gradually the
spring matured; it first agitated the world and then the forests of
lotuses; it first revealed the rapturous hearts of lovers and then the
rows of aśoka trees flashing redness; it first made the lovers close
their eyes towards their sweet-hearts and then the clusters of lotuses;
it first cleaved the hearts of the separated ladies and then the buds
of creepers; it foremost darkened the hearts of the passionate and
then the forests of flowers with swarms of bees; when unnoticed
the nights became shorter, the tanks of lotuses gave up their dry-
ness brought about by frost, and the rays of the moon and the trees
gave up smokiness. When the rays of the sun and the arrows
of Smara increased, then the spring, a dear friend of the
Splendour of the Forest, kept ready for her as it were on all sides

the glory of its friend, the Sun, increasingly day by day; when
slowly the flowers of rāja-campaka, possessing the radiance of mol-
ten gold, burst forth, enkindling the fire of love of the lovers re-
sembling in complexion the kunkuma-rubbed breasts of their sweet-
hearts; (74) when Makaraketu inspired the world as if it was agitat-
ed, unsteady, eager and drunk by the humming of the bees which
seemed to be the sweet songs of the sylvan deity anxious at the ad-
vent of spring, as if they were the twangings of the bows of the
archer Madana, as if they were jinglings of the jewelled armlets of
the Forest Glory engaged in preparing the implements of Madhu;
when the mādhavi creepers decked with dark leaves, covered by
the Malaya wind enkindled the fire of passion even in the dull,
which (wind) was very cool due to its close proximity to the san.
dal trees, which gave rise to the sport of Madana even when the
lovers were nearby, uprooting the pride of the haughty women and
which though southerly is uncharitable to the separated ones;
when the Malaya wind straightened the puffed up minds of the
Kerala women as also their curls of hair; when it fanned the anger
in the hearts of the Cola women as also the borders of their gar:
ments; when it ruffled the mind of the Kuntala women affected by
the faults of the lovers as also their wreaths in the braids of hair;
when the bunches of madhūka flowers increased in palor as if com-
peting with the cheeks of the separated ladies; when clusters of
kurabakas, blue, yellow and red, shone like colourful gems in the
crown of the king of spring; when the intoxicated notes of the
cuckoos, sharper due to eating the fresh blossoms of mango reach-
ed far though issuing falteringly as the throats were choked, and
which seemed to be the commands of Smara causing anguish to
the minds of the travellers; when the aśoka trees joyously bloomed
on experiencing the pleasure of the striking of the feet of the
women; when the buds of kesara bloomed into flowers on receiv-
ing mouthfuls of the wine from the women; when the tilaka
trees flowered out of joy on coming into contact with the
much-desired glances of the lotus-eyed ones and which turned
white due to the lustre of the eyes; when the kurabaka trees
possessed the splendour of variegated bunches of flowers having
obtained the long-desired embraces of the women with drowsy
eyes, and which (trees) could not contain within themselves their
excessive joy and therefore emitted it out through the buds; thus
in the spring the trees yearned to fulfil their desires like the lovers;
when the mādhavī creepers decked with dark leaves, covered by
swarms of bees and with the cooing of the intoxicated cuckoos in-
cited passion in the paramours like the abhisärikās, anointed with

the knots of pride (of the arrogant women); when the fullgrown
vasanta creeper possessed some indescribable beauty as it rested

taka-dyed foot-prints of the Sylvan Beauty manifesting herself
all of a sudden out of greed for honey; when the forests of kimśuka
suddenly burst forth on all sides like the fire of Love with smoke-

all separated ones on earth; when the forests of aśoka trees
agonized the separated ones with the embodied fire of Love with

like the wheels of Smara; when continuously elā-fruit burst forth
spreading its fragrance of the ripe fruits on all sides like the scent
of the rut of the fierce scented elephant of Spring moving about in
chains of gold; when the Malaya breeze infatuates the whole world
as if by a poisonous breeze mixed with the poisonous breathing of

union with Spring; which (love) being excessive could not be con-

Fish-bannered God who conquered the three worlds, whitened the

agonized by a separation from their beloveds; then the clusters of
aśoka flowers, as charming as the breasts of the Hūna ladies rubbed
with kurkuma, filled with love, looked like berry-balls (76) made by

drooping due to the internal heat, with their armlets in the form

lotus leaves, with their faces in the form of the puņdarikas losing

ly made to dance by the Malaya wind like a dancing teacher.
During (such a spring) on the vernal pilgrimage of the God
Kālapriya Deva, the fortunate (VINAYADHARA) who by his
beauty and wealth conquered the Fish-bannered God, who was
skilful in all the arts came to see the God attired in a charming
dress along with his friends of the same age and conduct. While
out of curiosity he was moving on the temple grounds, by chance
a courtesan came there. She was, it seemed, a conquering missile
of the Flower-armoured God, a ray of the moon to the night lotuses
in the form of the eyes of the people, a lotus-tank for the bees in
the form of the senses, the moving ground for the elephant in the
form of Smara, who transformed the sky by the lustre of her moon-
face even during the day due to the moonlight of her face. On
seeing her he thought that Prajāpati, the creator of the world
cannot be her Creator, (77) for her beauty was quite distinct from
that of the other women created by him. Thinking thus he came
within her sight. On beholding him she was pierced like a deer by
an arrow of the hunter Love, and her body had horripilation like a
lotus-stalk in the lake of love. At the sight of each other the tender
shoot of love of these two shot up. He assigned the work of making
her acquaintance to his clever friend VIDAGDHA and went home.
Through her friend TARALIKĀ, VIDAGHA made her acquaintance
and then related the whole thing to VINAYADHARA. VINAYA-
DHARA sent him again to take her promise.
In dalliance with that ANANGAVATĪ he spent that night as in a
moment. Thus enjoying amorous pleasures in her company many
days passed. In course of time all his wealth was expended, still to
her he was dearer than life. When the bawd came to know that she
had turned away all other rich men and was attached to him alone
she herself drove him out. But under some pretext he gained en-
trance again. Scorning him she again and again drove him out.
ANAŃGAVATI, however, continued to meet him either at a rented
house or at a friend's place. When the bawd saw that ANAŃGA:
VATI was still meeting him she admonished her thus: “You meet
him again, well do not blame me (afterwards) that I did not warn
you."
Now once while VINAYADHARA was coming from his house
he saw a recently killed frightful snake. Thinking that it will serve
his purpose he hid it in his belt. Going near her house he sent
to ANAŃGAVATĪ his fees through a good friend and came to sleep.
At the middle of the night he entered the next bedroom where the
intoxicated bawd was sleeping. He slowly spread the dead serpent

on her body and with his sharp nails pinched her nose and lips.
The bawd got up shrieking 'I am stung, I am stung'. He entered
the room quickly and hit the serpent five-six times with a stick.
When the maid-servants quickly came and put on the lights, he
looked at the serpent and said "I shall make an incision”, while
(she) said: "make it, make it” he asked: "Where?' and as soon as
she said: 'here here' he cut off per lips and nose.
The fear of death was gone and at the break of dawn felicita-
tions were offered that the 'mother' was alive. But to her (the bawd)
the congratulatory drum sounded indeed like the heralding of death
and she repented night and day.
Thus, o daughter, when rogues are harassed they take revenge
in such a way that it is difficult to describe it.

(78) In my opinion no one should ever be insulted. When men
are insulted there is nothing that they desist from doing.
In Pañcāla there is a town called Kānyakubja. There ruled
king MAHENDRAPĀLA who was difficult to be looked at like the
sun, and who conquered by his hands the circle of powerful enemies.
He had a great feudatory named PRATAPASIMHA who was clever,
pleasing, rich, noble, charitable, sacrificing, learned and affectionate.
He was ugly and hairy, and by nature given to sport. He was sent
to his country by the king, so staying there for some days he re-
turned again to serve the king.

a dark umbrella, for warding off heat on account of the very tall
green trees; it appeared as if holding a bow...... under the guise
of the lustre of variegated gems wondering why while it is present
Indra (he who had destroyed their wings) should hold a bow; where
the directions were scented by the fragrance spreading here and
there as the barks of the old sallakī trees were crushed by the intoxi-
cated elephants rubbing their temples against them; where the depths
of the thickets were resounding with the splitting of the skin of

high ridges; (79) whose regions were covered with many madana,

the lustre of campaka and madana trees, as if by beloveds who are

All the three should be abandoned from a distance. For by these
even family women are made objects of contempt. Therefore like
the poison of the poisonous snake love at sight and on hearing should
be kept at a distance. I shall narrate a story about it to satisfy your
curiosity. Listen;
In Avanti is the city of Ujjayini. There ruled King VIKRAMA-
DITYA who obtained the title of a sovereign by the valour of his
hands and whose deeds were famous and wonderful. There also
lived the dhūrta MÜLADEVA. He was clever, master of roguery,
skillful in all the arts and an object of the king's affections. He
brought under subjection the smart, cheated the clever, deceived the
intelligent, made the cheats to dance about, and augmented his
wealth. He always doubted the actions of women and never married.
Now when once after king VIKRAMĀRKA time and again ask-
ed him why he did not marry, MŪLADEVA said: "Sire, women are
difficult to be pleased, they have bad intentions, are fickle by nature,
difficult to be protected, they become detached very soon and cherish
love for the low-born. It is said in the śrutis and the smộtis that a
woman is the half of this body. Therefore even when a man is not
himself a sinner he becomes to be regarded as such due to her
wickedness. Therefore I shall end my life without taking a wife."
The king said: “It is not so. Woman is an instrument to the attain-
ment of the three goals of life. She is the sole abode of happiness and
the root of fame, wealth and offspring. The householder's life is the
mainstay of all the other stages of life. Without begetting a son a
man (85) never frees himself from the debt of his ancestors. There-
fore you must take a wife, and do not be so suspicious.”
[When thus spoken to MŪLADEVA is somehow convinced and gets
married.]

(Afterwards MÜLADEVA found out that his wife was carrying
on with a merchant by name DATTAKA, and the king's chief queen
too was unfaithful to the king by going every night to her paramour,
the king's elephant driver. One night he followed her and saw that
the elephant-driver lashed her with a chain for being late. The next
day the disillusioned MŪLADEVA told the king about it.) (87).
(88) The king was surprised and asked MŪLADEVA:
"MÜLADEVA, what is this? This is indeed wonderful. Please
satisfy my curiosity by saying what it is." Folding his hands MŪLA-
DEVA said: “Şire, if you give me the promise of fearlessness then
I shall tell you. Your Majesty should not punish me then.” Saying
this he said to the queen: "Madam, without the paramour the food
cannot be relished. Therefore call the king's elephant-driver,
BAȚHARAKA”. Being wonderstruck the King said: “MŪLADEVA,
what is this?". MÜLADEVA said: “Bare the body of this queen and
see it." When the king did that and looked at it then he saw the
swollen marks of the chains. MÜLADEVA made his foolish wiſe sit
on the second seat and said: “You also call your paramour, the mer-
chant by name DATTAKA", and then said: “Sire, it was indeed your
favour that I was married. I knew the conduct of women, therefore I
never married. But by your lordship's order I accepted and married
this foolish person. The result is the same. They (women) are sinful
and of wicked conduct, who can trust them? There is no king like
yourself, nor is there a master of rogues like myself, not a wise man
like KAPĀLAŠIKHA. When they can deceive even us what can
happen to the other poor people?” The king arrested the elephant-
driver, confiscated DATTAKA'S wealth, and outcasted him, and cut
off the nose and ears of CILLAMAHĀDEVĪ and giving only morsels
of food put her into prison.

The complex mechanical contrivances speak of the progress of
science in those days.
In the SS, Bhoja devotes the entire 31st chapter to 'Yantravidhā-

and benefits.
The word 'Yantra' is derived from the root ‘Yam' to control or
to restrain. God evolves the universe and also controls its movements:

There are two kinds of controls. The first is the self-control
of human beings, the second is the control of the five elements of
nature.

So the control of the four primary elements namely earth, water,
fire and wind (and ākāśa as their substratum) leads to the production
of the mechanical contrivances. Different materials like metals,
leather and cloth are then put to use and with the help of wheels,
rods and the like, syringes (vs. 28), musical instruments (56), drama-
tic representations and scenes (59-72), moving animals (73), dancing

of a cool fountain-house called himagsha. Besides various mecha-

etc. (pp. 436-441).
The Yaśastilaka-Campū (Book III pp. 522-533) also has descrip-

phants, crocodiles, monkeys and dolls and so on are mentioned.

rent professional activities. Among them can be included CUTTIA.

travels etc.), p9r5ztą (lapidary art) and TTCTTTT: (the knowledge
of planting, nourishing and diagnosing trees).
Finally there are games in which skill was deemed necessary
for the entertaining as well as enjoying: 364aFtą (playing drums
etc. in water), JG Tata: (sprinkling water), Huaestaticarafer:
(gamble on live things), TATRATTTTTĄ (teaching birds like
parrots to speak and carry messages), 3787THCF172494 (making
syllabic language for private talks), qorxftat (making carts of
flowers), वृतविशेषाः and आकर्षक्रीडा (gambling) and बालक्रीडनकानि
(knowing playing balls, dolls etc. to help children).
There are three more arts for self-development, self-defence
and life. They are afriti fa&ITAÍ JEH (code of etiquette and
modesty), affini fanai Traa (science of obtaining victory) and
QTTTTTTTi fagri TTĄ (knowledge of the science connected with
physical exercises like hunting).
This list of Kalās has been explained along with many other
lists by Dr. A. Venkatasubbiah and E. Müller in an article named
'The Kalās' (J. R. A. S. 1914 pp. 351-367). But reference may be
made here to two more lists given by Kşemendra in Kalāvilāsa and
by Dandin in Dasakumāracarita.
Kşemendra mentions 64 arts. of the harlots: TEET TFELT
QOUTESÀ MTTT: fot: 1 (p. 56). Of these, except nștyakalā, gîtakalā
pānakalā, none are similar to those quoted above. These
are simply the characteristics of harlots like weeping, cheating and
so on. But they are interesting from our point of view because the
heroines in the SMK show mastery in some of the arts mentioned
herein. For instance Devadattā (5th tale) practises mytopamakalā,
and also tirtha-viharana-kalā.
In the Dasakumāracarita (Book II) also we get a list of arts and
sciences in which a gaạikā is trained to bring her profession to a
successful end.
... The second group of Kalās which is referred to in the SMK by
the term 'Ubhaya' is the group of 64 Pāñcāliki Vidyās described in
the Sāmprayogika-Adhikarana by Vātsyāyana in the Kāmasītra.
These are intimately connected with sexual relations.

Kadavakka ( कडवक्क) P. १७
--is a Sanskrit rendering of the Prakrit word 2524 (See
.Svayambhūcchandas, VIII, 30, Journal of the University of Bombay.
November 1936, कडवय here is by mistake printed as कउवय )
Hemacandra and others give its Sanskrit form as saf, that is with
a single ai (See the first sūtra of the Chandonuśāsana). It is also
written as 59 (Cf. Kavidarpaņa, edited by Prof. H. D. Velankar,
A. B. O. R. I. XVI i-ii 1935, note 51). Old Gujarati narrative poems
were also composed in units called 90. But here 45977 does not
appear to be an unit of composition, but a variety of composition.
It may be noted that this form of composition is peculiar to the
Apabhramśa literature, while here the use of the word is with refer-
ence to the Purānas. Can we infer that the author had in view some
Apabhraíśa Purāņa or some Purāṇas in the local language of the
times?
Manikulya ( मणिकुल्या) P. .१७
-is a kind of composition described by Bhoja in the SP thus:
(Vol. II, p. 428).
मणिकुल्यायां जलमिव न लक्ष्यते यत्र पूर्वतो वस्तु । पश्चात्प्रकाशते सा मणिकुल्या मत्स्यहस्तादि।
Nidarsana (निदर्शनम् ) P. १७
—is a kind of composition. Bhoja describes it thus:
निश्चीयते तिरश्चामतिरश्चां वा यत्र चेष्टाभिः ।
कार्यमकार्य वा तन्निदर्शनं पञ्चतन्त्रादि ।।
धूर्तक्टिकुट्टनीमतमयुरमार्जारिकादि यल्लोके ।
कार्याकार्यनिरूपणपरमिह निदर्शनं तदपि ॥
(SP, Vol. II, p. 428)
The second type of Nidarśana described by Bhoja shows that it em.
braced the works which describe the proper and improper actions
as is done in the works like the Kuttanimata.
Technically speaking this description appears to be applicable
to the SMK, though in the text as shown at length in chapter IV it
is always referred to and recognized as a kathā and nowhere it is
called Nidarśana. But a detailed consideration of the question
awaits the publication of the full text of SP, so that we may have all
the data relevant for judging whether the distinctions made by
Bhoja between different kinds of Prabandhas are well defined and
mutually exclusive.

Lataksutkah (लटक्षुट्कः ) P. २५
--taking rounds, faltering. The word is of onomatopoetic
origin and is represented in Hindi as 'Agata in the same sense.
..............
Udyānilea ( उद्यानिका ) P. २५
--This word is obviously a back-formation from the Prakrit
Forforart etc. and preserved in the current Gujarati as FOTOT
'picnic'. PSM gives three forms outfr377, 365 Tfurt and JJTOTT
meaning 'picnic'. The word is derived from SOUTU (EFT) PSM
quotes the following from the Niśīthacūrņī:

Tiritillitāni (fefefefeestift) P. 174
--This word is a Sanskritization of Prakrit fafcffost --base
fafcfcfcmsy. It is an instance of the influence of the contemporary
Jaina diction on Bhoja. The root feffect is recorded by Hemcan-
dra in his list of ETETTEETS in the sense of 7 (Prakrit Grammar
4.161). PSM records the form fefeferon from Kumārapālacarita.
Ganaratnamahodadhi of Vardhamānācārya notes the word fefefeft
(II.103) and in the commentary he says farfest 474 atafaatana
fefefeffer * TUTH | He also calls it plan cutátor-fefefefeatefacaanitust

Lagna ( 577 ) P. 30
-to feel. The usage and the sense of the word iş of the
Prakrit root SITE, feels. Cf. Gujarati are in the same sense.
Avvā ( soat) P. 37, 33
--The word at which at two other places is mistakenly
written as 3ta and 3ra by the scribe is of Kannada origin, mean-
ing 'mother' or any 'venerable woman'. Hemacandra (Desinīma..
mālā 1,5) notes it in the sense of ATT, oprati. Cf. the suffix . 3fogt
applied to proper names like Kundavvā, Amiyavvā, etc. occurring
in some 9th-10th century Apabhrarnsa works from Kannada area.
Cf. also the Kannada word avvā meaning ‘mother'. The scribe prob-
ably did not understand the word and wrote the forms corruptly as
34 and 37&TI
Uttha viale ( उत्थ विअले ) P. ३४
.:.:--can be rendered into Sanskrit as उत्तिष्ठ विकले if we take उत्थ

fuera, Sanskrit faraficat 'a perturbed woman'.

Velavittika ( वेलावित्तिका ) P. ३४
-a maid-servant who earns by announcing time (Cf. Velā-
vittaka). The words prasādavittikā (p. 38) and arghya-vittikā
(p.4c) are similarly formed. The former meaning 'one whose for-
tune is in his master's favour' and the second referring to 'one
whose fortune is in offering arghya (to God)'. The courtesan in
the temple is described as arghya-vittikā (Cf. Lāvaṇyasundarī,
8th tale).
Tarkuka-jana (Joh 17, ) P. xp
--This is a rare Sanskrit word. It means á beggar, a sup-
pliant. The other forms noted by MW (p. 440). in the same sense
being Japan (Mbh) and topft (lex.). MW further (p. 58 ) gives
two words 9580*7 and 2791 which also convey the same meaning
of 'beggar'.
Though the other form of apainamely; topic is given in
the Mahâbhärata it seems to be a late form and may be occurring
in the interpolated portion of the Mbh. : :
बाई ए कुक्कुडु बासइ ए क्कु लियंतह दुइजउ नासइ। (p. ५६)
‘Mistress, this cock crows: As we take one, we lose the other'.
This is some Apabhraíśa metrical line quoted as a proverb, as the
rhyme of aths and fri shows; and the portion beginning with
en fast upto 7 ThE is in the well-known Prakrit metre called Vada-
naka having the structure 4+4+4+- UU. This means that the
first line is metrically defective.
.............
Putlearosi (पूत्करोषि ) P. ५६
--to cry aloud.' It is same as the Prakrit' v 9897 Cf. Gujarati
cara, 1975. It is commonly used in the Prakrit and Apa:
bhraśa literature.
.....
Aclea ( अक्का ) P. ६१
the word is used in the sense of a mother' or 'an elder sister'.
The bawd or the procuress of a courtesan is usually addressed as
akka...
The word Akkā is of non-Sanskritic origin. Its vocative is
Irregularly Akka and hence it is recorded by Pāņini. (MW p. 2).

Hemacandra notes it in Deśināmamālā. 1.6. The word occurs in
Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, etc.
..........
· Kaditallā ( Afs ) P. 63
--PSM records schot in the sense of a kind of an iron weapon
which has one edge sharp and is a little curved. It refers to Deśīnā-
mamālā 2.19..In' Harişena's Brhatkathakośa also (edited by
Dr. A. N. Upadhye) the word #feareas occurs ( festest FITFOGG
gTqET:/ 56.298). The editor in the Introduction (p. 102) explains it as
'some armour or weapon associated with the belt and compares the
word with Sanskrit Katitra and Prakrit Kadilla. This meaning is
obviously suggested by him on the assumption that the part of
in the word कडितल्ल is connected with Sanskrit कटि.
...in ......
Vantha (798) P. 84
is a desya word. MW (p. 915) records it as a lexical word
occurring in the sense of a maimed person, an unmarried person,
a servant or a dwarf. Over and above these senses PSM. gives the
word in the sense of dhūrta or thug. Cf. Gujarati ga, to go
astray. This is another instance of Bhoja's diction being influenc-
ed by the Prakrit, Apabhramśa and the other spoken languages of
the times. The Prabhandha-Cintamani has a augFTETTCITYOPETT
which describes the vanthas to be dwarf in body and attending
on the King by massaging his feet. (P. 75).
. .............4
Pattanikå (Taffait ) P. 190,68
--The word pattanikā (fem.) is not found in the lexicons. The
reference to it is as follows. Sundaraka was commissioned by the
king (10th tale) to spend a night in dalliance with Aśokavati and
record the events, so that the king could show. it to Chaddalaka and
break their bond of love and faith. For that purpose Sundaraka
brings along with him the Pattanikā which records what passes
between them. (75: TATOUTTE qaferirani ferro referat Farferstar-
नाययत् ... तेषां नखपदानां तम पत्तनिकया तत्प्रतिबिम्बानि जग्राह)
The next day he gives it back to the king and the king presents it
to Chaddalaka saying:
1. TU TATE: SATU TEATA I
Therefore it seems to be an instrument, Yantra, to take impressions
of happenings which could be reviewed the next day by spreading
it out.

Last Folio, 158. (p. ८९), .....
The fragment of folio 158 is the most important page in the
SMK, though its loss is irreparable.. .It contains a prasasti of the
work and its author in three Sanskrit verses and four Prakrit
Gathas.
: The metrical. Sanskrit verses help us to infer. the number of
missing letters. The first verse is in Mālini metre. Thus:

UUUUUU-- U --U-
U U U U U U – – – U – – U – ..

problem of the date of the work. . .. ...
