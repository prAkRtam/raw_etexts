FOREWORD
We have great pleasure in releasing for publication the third volume
of the collected papers of Prof. Dr. P. K. Gode dealing with Indian literary
history. It is unnecessary for us to refer to the unique services of Dr. P. K.
Gode to Indology. Up to 1956 he has published over 455 research papers
relating to Indian literary and cultural history in several Oriental Journals
and Commemoration Volumes, besides being fruitfully occupied with his
work as Curator of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute during
the last thirty-seven years, as the Organiser and Editor of four Oriental
Journals and several Commemoration Volumes in honour of Indian and
foreign Indologists as also several Volumes of the Descriptive Catalogue of
Manuscripts in the Government Manuscripts Library at the B. O. R. Insti-
tute. It was thought necessary to publish in book-form all the research
papers of Dr. Gode covering about eight volumes of 500 pages each.
Acārya Jinavijayaji Muni, former Honorary Director of the Bhāra-
tīya Vidyā Bhavan, Bombay, and Honorary Director of the Rajasthan
Purātattva Mandir, Jaipur, very generously undertook to publish two
volumes of Dr. Gode's papers, bearing on Indian literary history, each
volume containing about 500 pages. The work on these volumes was
accordingly started and by July 1951, when Dr. Gode completed his sixtieth
year, a major portion of these volumes was already printed off. However,
these two volumes were actually published about the beginning of 1955.
Availing themselves of the occasion of Dr. Gode's completing his
sixtieth year on 11th July 1951, an informal meeting of his friends was
held at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, on 25th July 1951 to
find out ways and means for the publication of the remaining volumes of
his papers with a view to completing the work started by Acārya Jina-
vijayaji. Accordingly, " Prof. P. K. Gode Collected Works Publication Commi-
ttee", consisting of the following persons, was formed at the meeting for
the purpose of collecting the necessary funds for the publication of these
volumes by enlisting the co-operation of all friends and sympathisers in-
terested in Oriental learning throughout the world :-
1 Prin. J. R. Gharpure (Chairman)
2 Dr. R. N. Dandekar (Treasurer)
3 Dr. A. D. Pusalker
( Secretaries )
4 Prof. N. A. Gore

6 Prof. R. D. Karmarkar
7 Prof. H. D. Velankar
8 Dr. C. Kunhan Raja
9 Dr. V. Raghavan
10 Dr. P. V. Bapat
On the 15th of August 1951 the Committee issued an appeal signed by
over 70 well-known personalities in different walks of life from all over
India inviting contributions to the proposed fund. The Committee is grate-
ful to all the contributors to this fund for their spontaneous and generous
response. A list of these contributors is appended to this Foreword.
Thanks to the co-operation of these friends and the press, the Commi-
ttee has been able at long last to publish the third volume of Dr. Gode's
papers, which contains 28 papers and extends over 260 pages.
We are happy to record that Ācārya Vishva Bandhu Shastri,
Director, Vishveshyaranand Vedic Rasearch Institute, Hoshiarpur, has
offered to publish the fourth volume of Dr. Gode's papers dealing with
Indian cultural history. The printing of this volume has just been started.
We feel confident that the printing of the fifth volume also will be started
before the fourth volume is out.
On this occasion of the publication of the third volume of his
papers we wish Dr. Gode long life full of health and activity. We are
glad to note that Dr. Gode is still pursuing all his research activities with
the same energy and vigour as hitherto.

PREFACE
I have great pleasure in presenting to the world of scholars this
third volume of my Studies in Indian Literary History, which is a continu.
ation of Volumes I and II of these Studies published by my esteemed
friend Acārya Muni Jinavijayaji in the Singhi Jain Series of the Bhāratīya
Vidya Bhavan, Bombay. As these two volumes were brought out solely
through the benefaction of Acārya Jinavijayaji the present volume is being
published through the goodwill and active efforts of my affectionate friends
Dr. A. D. Pusalker and Prof. N. A. Gore in organising the Committee for the
publication of my Collected Works and collecting the necessary funds for
it. The Foreword of the Committee to the present volume with the list of
my friends, who have generously contributed towards the cost of its publi-
cation, gives me added confidence and encouragement in my life's work
viz. my Studies in Indian Literary and Cultural history on which, I have
spent the last forty years of my life. God willing, I may still do some more
useful work in this field. I cannot adequately thank all these friends who
have made the publication of this volume possible. Special thanks are due
to all the members of the Committee and in particular to its Chairman
Principal J. R. Gharpure, whose blessings I have enjoyed during the last
quarter of a century, to Dr. R. N. Dandekar (Treasurer ) for his advice
and co-operation in the publication of the three volumes of my studies and
in various other matters pertaining to them and to Dr. Pusalker and
Prof. Gore, who prepared at great inconvenience to themselves the Indices
to my volumes and who spared no pains in collecting the Publication
Fund for my works, not to say their active help in the editing of the third
volume. But for the efforts of Dr. Pusalker and Prof. Gore this third
volume of my studies would not have seen the light of the day.
Judging by the numerous appreciative reviews of Vols. I and II of
my Studies published in India and outside so far I have reason to believe
that my continuous research work during the last four decades of my life
has been found useful by all experts and laymen interested in the field of
my studies. This belief of mine is further confirmed by the translations
of some of my articles in Hindi and other languages of India that have
appeared during the last fifteen years. I derived much inspiration for my
research work from two gurus viz. the late Dr. P. D. Gune and Dr. R. D.
Ranade, both of whom were among the prominent founders of the B. O. R.

Institute. It was on the advice of both these gurus that I joined the
Institute on 26-4-1919. I owe to them a deep debt of gratitude. In partial
redemption of this debt I have dedicated Vol. I of my Studies to Dr. Gune
and his esteemed friend Muni Shri Jinavijayaji. I have also succeeded with
the help of Dr. Gune's friends, pupils, admirers and children in collecting Dr.
P. D. Gune Memorial Fund, which was handed over to the University of
Poona in 1955 by myself and my friend Prof. C. R. Devad har on behalf of
the Dr. P. D. Gune Memorial Committee. The Poona University has kindly
accepted the amount of this fund and a “Dr. P. D. Gune Memorial Lecture-
ship” has been founded by them. Though my debt to Dr. Ranade is irredee-
mable it is my pleasant duty to dedicate the present volume to him as a
token of my reverence and gratitude to him on the occasion of the comple-
tion of his 70th year on 3rd July 1956. I pray God to give him long life
and good health to inspire his pupils, friends and devotees in walks, both
spiritual and temporal.
In the correction of proofs of the present volume I have received
considerable help from my friends Shri S. N. Savadi and Shri G. N.
Shrigondekar of the B. O. R. Institute. I convey to them my cordial
thanks for this unstinted help and co-operation. Finally I have to convey
my hearty thanks to Shri M. S. Sathe, the Manager of the Prājña Press,
Wai, and all workers of this Press for the neat and careful printing of the
volume.
As this volume is being published the printing of the fourth volume
of my Studies has been started by the Vishveshvarananda Vedic Research
Institute, Hoshiarpur. This volume will contain some of my articles on
Indian Cultural History. I record here my best thanks to my affectionate
friend Prof. Vishva Bandhu Shastri, the Director of this Institute for his
friendly act (bandhu-krtya) in persuading his committee to undertake
this volume for publication in their series.

1. The Gandhasara of Gangadhara — An Unknown Treatise
on Gandhasastra and its Critical Analysis *
In his delightful and scholarly account of Indian Toilet 1 Dr. G. P.
Majumdar has collected a good deal of historical information about scents
and perfumes as manufactured and used by our forefathers. The sources
ransacked by Dr. Majumdar for this information are (1) the Vedic texts,
(2) Pali texts, (3) Suśruta Samhitā, (4) Sukraniti, (5) Arthaśāstra, (6) Agni-
purāņa, (7) Byhatsamhita ( section on Gandhayukti ), (8) Mahābhārata
( Sāntiparvan), (9) Šārngadhara-paddhati, (10) Kāmasútra of Vātsyāyana,
(11) Lalitavistara, (12) Mārkandeyapurāņa, (13) Yuktikalpataru of King
Bhoja, (14) Nātyaśāstra of Bharata, (15) Amarakośa, (16) Materia Medica
of the Hindus, by U. C. Datta, etc. On the strength of data gathered from
these sources Dr. Majumdar concludes as follows :-
"Thus it may be seen that most of the ingredients of Indian toilet,
flowers, garlands, perfumes, scents, cosmetics, paints, ointments and
pastes were derived from plants. For the patterns of ornaments too men
were equally indebted to the plant world — the trees, leaves, flowers, fruits
and creepers."
In view of the evidence about the wide-spread use of scents and
cosmetics in Ancient India we are tempted to inquire if there existed any
special treatises on the manufacture of these cosmetics and scents, contain-
ing recipes about their manufacture in detail. We have reason to believe
that some such treatises did exist but unfortunately no manuscripts of
these treatises have yet been discovered or recorded in our MSS catalogues
of different libraries. For a long time I was on a look-out for such MSS
and fortunately two such MSS of two different works on Gandhaśāstra
have been discovered by me. I propose, therefore, to give in this paper a
critical notice of one of these MSS for the benefit of scholars interested
in the history of Indian Cosmetics.
Some years ago the late Pandit Rangacharya Raddi presented a
collection of MSS to the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute, Poona. This collection
called the Raddi Collection contains a bundle consisting of two works on
* Journal of the University of Bombay, Vol. XIV, Part II, pp. 44-50.
1 Vide Ch. IV (pp. 83-106 ) of Some Aspects of Indian Civilization, by G. P. Majumdar,
Calcutta, 1938.

Studies in Indian Literary History
Gandhaśāstra, viz., (1) the Gandhasāra, by Gangādhara, and (2) Gandhavāda.
Both these works are unknown to Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum or to
the Editors of the Revised Cata. Catalogorum that is being prepared by the
University of Madras.1
The manuscript is written on country paper and appears to be about
200 years old. It consists of 49 folios (11 inches x 47 inches) with 11 lines
on each page. The folios comprising the two works are as follows:-
Folios 1 to 27a - गन्धसार of गङ्गाधर.
Folios 27b to 49 -गन्धवाद with Marathi commentary.
The Gandhasāra 2 begins as follows on Folio 1 :-
" श्रीगणेशायनमः ॥ श्रीगुरुभ्यो नमः॥

गंधर्वयक्षोरगराजसेवितः।

1 My friend Dr. V. Raghavan, who is in charge of the Revised Cata. Catalogorum, has infor-
med me that no MSS of the Gandhasāra and Gandhavāda have come to his notice so far.
2 Vide article on Cosmetics in Encyclo. Brittannica, Vol. 6, ( 14th Edn. ), pp. 485-488. Cog-
metics are substances of diverse origin scientifically compounded and used (1) to cleanse, (2) to
allay skin troubles, (3) to cover up imperfections, and (4) to beautify. They have been used by
men and women from the earliest times. Probably they originated in the East, Egypt has the
earliest records of them from 3500 B. C. onwards as follows:
3500 B. C.-Unguent vase in ala baster ( British Museum ).
2800 B. C.--Mirrors of 6 th Dynasty.
1500 B. C.--Kohl vases in glass and Stibium pencils of 18th Dynasty.
Do --Papyrus showing men and women having lumps of nard on the top of head.
1350 B. 0.-Unguent vases found in Tutan Khamun's tomb contained aromatics which
2 were still fragrant when opened.
1600 B. C.--A granite tablet on a Sphinx portraying the offering of incense and fragrant
oil or unguent.
The Bible refers to cosmetics used by Jewish women. The Koran refers to aromatics. Nero
(A. D. 54) and his wife made free use of perfumes and cosmetics. The Romans used almond,
rose or quince for solid unguents. Liquid ones were made from flowers, spices and gums.

Perfumes are substances which by their fragrance gratify the sense of smell. The history of
perfumes is closely associated with that of cosmetics. Many of the earliest forms were made by
digesting odorous vegetable substances with sesame, almond, or olive oil. The principle under-
lying this process is still made use of although in an improved form, which is called Maceration.
This article then deals with such topics as Distillation, Expression, Extraction, Animal Perfumes,
Balsams, Gums and Oleo-resins, Synthetics and Isolates, Artificial Flower-oils and Finished
Perfumes.

The foregoing analysis of the rare MS of this treatise on Gandha-
śāstra gives us the following information about its author and the scope of
the treatise with allied particulars :-
(1) Gangādhara is the author of the work. He calls himself Kovida,
i.e., an expert in this science of Cosmetics and Perfumery designated as
Gandhaśāstra.
(2) The name of the work is Gandhasāra as stated by our author in
all the colophons as also in the verses at the beginning and end of the
work.
(3) The Gandhaśāstra is called by our author as gria ( difficult to
comprehend ), fagastu ( the materials of which are of a scattered nature )
and faaa ( vast in its scope or extensive ). Consequently our author com•
piled this treatise by gathering materials from several sources (संगृह्य वाक्यैः
797).
(4) Though our author has composed his treatise on the basis of
earlier materials he does not mention any work or author by name. This
circumstance makes it difficult for us to fix the chronology of the author
and his work. In one or two places he merely states" giatia " but he
never mentions any it or its author,
(5) Our author bows to the gods : (i) setthaat or gråatofa, i.e., Śiva,
(ii) EfT or Ganapati, (iii) gat ( Sarasvatī, the goddess of speech ) and (iv)
गन्धर्वयक्ष or गन्धयक्ष ( the presiding deity of the गंधशास्त्र) attending upon God
Siva.
(6) Our author, though himself an expert (or fag) in Gandhaśāstra
bows to his predecessors in the field, who are styled as " TENTATIE”.
(7) Our author mentions six processes in the manufacture of Cos-
metics, viz. :-
(i) 27199-Infusing or saturating powders with fluid.
(ii) qaa-Ripening or cooking or decoction of materials which
have undergone the process of भावन.

(iii) बोध---This is defined as follows (fol. 2):--

" बोधस्तु बोधकैव्यैः कुचकोलमुरादिभिः ।
बाधकद्रव्यः कुचकालमुरादिभिः ।
दशापिंडचतुर्थांशो बोधस्यात्ते दलाह्वयाः ॥"
(iv) वेध--"वेधो हींदुमदाकास्त्रचलकीरोनुचंद्रकैः ।
कार्यः क्वचिद्बोधकैश्च मित्रामित्रविवेकतः ॥
द्वीपांशाः शुकशाल्यर्कनखासिल्हालवादयः ।

__(1) धूपन-Fumigating with aromatic vapours of incense, etc.
(vi) वासन-Scenting with the perfumes of flowers, etc.
(8) In dealing with पाचन our author describes some varieties of पाक
such as (1) पुटपाक, (2) गर्तपाक, (3) वेणुपाक, (4) दोलापाक, (5) खर्परपाक, (6) बैजयूरपाक,
(7) कालपाक, etc. Indian physicians are familiar with these processes of
manufacturing medicines, which were obviously used for the manufacture
of cosmetics and perfumes.
(9) The treatise consists of three chapters as follows:-
__(6) परिभाषा प्रकरण, explaining the technical terminology about the
Gandhasāstra;
(ii) गंधोदकादि नानागंधोपयोगि प्रकरण, dealing with the manufacture of
different kinds of aromatic products such as गंधोदक, पारिजात, मुखवास,
गंधतैल, वर्ति, निर्यास, जलवास, स्यंदु, धूलन etc.
(iii) निघंटुपरिसारे निघंटुपरीक्षादि प्रकरण, which first gives a glossary of
aromatic materials classified under (1) Leaves, (2) flowers, (3) fruits,
(4) barks, (5) sticks and (6) roots. The author then states how these
materials are to be examined before they are used for manufacture.
It appears to me even from my non-technical study of this rare
treatise that its author Gangādhara had a thorough knowledge of the
science of Gandhaśāstra. He has also successfully attempted in the present
treatise to systematise this knowledge for the benefit of humanity because
(1) it is useful in the worship of the gods which requires गंध and धूप, (2) it
contributes to the nourishment of men, (3) it enables men to realize the
fruits of the three objects of human existence, viz., धर्म, अर्थ and काम, (त्रिवर्ग-
फलदं), (4) it pleases the Kings and (5) it gladdens the minds of accompli.
shed women, and (6) it removes one's poverty also ( स्वस्य अपि अलक्ष्मीहर ).
According to the statement of the writer of the article on Cosmetics
in the Encyclopaedia Britannica the Cosmetics had their origin probably

Studies in Indian Literary History
in the East though the earliest records about their use about 3500 B, C.
and even earlier are found in Egypt. In view of the suggested Eastern
origin of the Gandhasāstra a systematic history of this Science and art
from Sanskrit and allied sources needs to be elaborately reconstructed.
For this reconstruction the present treatises viz., the Gandhasāra of
Gangādhara and the Gandhavāda with Marathi commentary will be very
helpful. In the present paper I have only analysed the MS of the Gandha-
sāra and have reserved a study of the MS of the Gandhavāda for a separate
paper.
The Romans made use of the rose in the preparation of solid
unguents. In the Gandhasāra no reference to the rose is found. The use of
rose in the manufacture of perfumery began very late in India i. e., in
the latter half of the 18th Century as proved by me in two papers 1 regard.
ing the manufacture of rose-water in India.
According to the Vai'seșikas, Gandha or smell is one of the 24
properties or gunas. It is a characteristic property of the Prthivi or earth.
Earth is accordingly defined as Ayaat yarat. Buchanan 2 in his account of
the Perfumery industry in Bihar and Arwal about A. D. 1811 mentions
the manufacture of an essence having the smell of dry clay as follows:-
"The most strange of these essences is that made with the clay,
which communicates to oil of Sandal-wood the smell, which dry clay
emits, when first wetted and which to me is far from agreeable. It sells at
13 rupee for each rupee weight.” gforat is haat indeed! The word TFT
in its bearing on perfumes has considerably influenced the Sanskrit
language as will be seen from the following terminology recorded by Mr.
Apte in his Sanskrit-English Dictionary:-
TAT:-Pounded sandal-wood.
Tri-Black aloe-wood.
TEATT*—A kind of perfume.
truig--Fragrant water.
TTFT-The wild lemon tree.
TEFAT-Sulphur.
Trie-Mixture of 8 fragrant substances offered to deities varying

The above collection of words has many cultural associations chara-
cteristic of Indian life as reflected in classical Sanskrit. For any systematic
study of the Indian science and art of perfumery on the basis of extant
literature, technical or otherwise, it is necessary to prepare a comprehen-
sive glossary of terms pertaining to this science and art. In the absence
of such a glossary it is difficult to understand the terminology peculiar to
the Gandhaśāstra as used in such treatises as the Gandhasāra of Gangadhara
and the Gandhavāda with Marathi commentary now discovered by me.
That there were special treatises ( before A. D. 1000 ) on Gandha-
śāstra by Lokeśvara and others is proved by the following stanzas of
Padmaśrī, the Buddhist author of the work on erotics, viz., Nāgarasarvasva
(ed. by T. Tripathi, Bombay, 1921 ).

ingredients 1 as current in c. 1000 A. D., and even earlier. This chapter,
therefore, provides us a good technical back-ground for the more elaborate
systematisation of the Gandhaśāstra as we notice in the Gandhasāra and

2. Vanamali Mis'ra, a Pupil of Bhattoji Diksita and
His Works-Between A. D. 1600 and 1660*
ACCORDING to Aufrecht 1 Bhattoji had a pupil of the name कृष्णदत्तमिश्र
called also वनमालिमिश्र. He was the son of महेशमिश्र and composed a work
called the कुरुक्षेत्रप्रदीप. Vanamali Misra also composed a work called
संध्यामन्त्रव्याख्या ब्रह्मप्रकाशिका, 2 a MS of which has been described by Stein.s
It begins as follows:-- 220
" महेश्वरं नमस्कृत्य वनमाली महेशजः ।।

Studies in Indian Literary History
MSS of these works are not accessible to me, I am unable to say if this
JAATTIAST, the commentator of a work of Bhattoji's nephew, is identical
with his namesake, the pupil of Bhattoji himself. H. P. Shastri,1 how-
ever, states that Vanamāli, the author of the 911 TUTHatsamatt, was a
pupil of Bhattoji Dīkşita himself.
In my paper on the date of Bhattoji Dīkşita published in the
Journal of the Tirupati Oriental Institute ( Vol, I, Part 2, pages 117-127)
I have fixed up Bhattoji's literary career between about A. D. 1560 and
1620. Subsequently I have published two papers, one on the Chronology
of the Works of Varadarāja ( P. V. Kane Volume, 1941, pages 188-199 )
and the other on the Chronology of the works of Nīlakantha Sukla ( New
Indian Antiquary, Vol. V, 1942, pages 177–183 ). Both these authors were
pupils of Bhattoji Dīkşita like Vana māli Miśra and composed works say
between A.D. 1610 and 1660. We have reason to suppose that Vanamāli
Miśra, their contemporary and co-student studying at the feet of their
common teacher Bhattoji, must have composed his works between about
A.D. 1610 and 1660. This is a reasonable conclusion but it needs to be
backed up by the evidence of contemporary MSS of the works of
Vanamāli Miśra. Such evidence was not so far available to me.
Fortunately in Fascicule II of the Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS in the Anup
Sanskrit Library at Bikaner by Dr. C. K. Raja and Mr. K. M. K. Sarma
( 1946.) I have found such evidence. It is as follows:
(1) Page 134--MS No. 5 -- Tita by Taifa THAISIÀST,
son of HEITAST and pupil of Hete ctiea, dated Samvat 1741
(= A. D. 1684 ).
This guru is no other than Bhattoji Dīkşita because Kauņda Bhatta in
his 714TOTTAVANT ( Benares Edition ) says:--
"Hellaelietà: sigmfhar: #lfl #aT: JHT: 1
CHĝa ziemiar: #1f#leat: qfaratæ II.”
These Kārikās number 71 of which 35 have been explained by Vanamāli
in this MS.

Samvat 1709 (= A. D. 152 ) copied by a .

Bhattoji wrote 71 Kārikās after the completion of his 3706IFTH. The MS No. 4229 contains
the first 35 Kārikās with commentary of Vanamāli who speaks of Bhattoji as his guru :-.
" Fra: fqaft Feat 972ThtPTI
गुरुभिर्ये कृताः श्लोकाष्टीका तेषां वितन्यते ॥"

Page 28****************************************************************************************
Vanamāli Miśra and His Works
It is clear from the above dated MSS of the Fact that this work was
composed by Vanamāli Miśra prior to A. D. 1652. Most probably this
MS was written during the lifetime of Vanamāli. I cannot say if he was
living up to A. D. 1684, when the other MS of this work was copied.
(3) Page 137--MS No. 61--palateitalt by the above Vanamāli
Miśra (this MS bears no date).
(4) Page 164-MS No. 19--içanigeratela by ATITHE, son of
रामेश्वरभट्ट copied by वनमालिमिश्र in Samvat 1678 (= A. D. 1621).
The Catalogue does not say if the copyist aanleiher of the above MS of
A. D. 1621 was pupil of Bhattoji. Most probably this aan CiT is identical
with his namesake, the author of m eta, patef9212T, JETTA-26T/ETI
FUTBTTF1, and perhaps of attitaHaHaT and igelsaacalaão. If this
identity is proved to be correct we can definitely say that this MS of A. D.
1621 is a specimen of the handwriting of one of the pupils of the great
grammarian Bhattoji Dīksita.
As regards Aufrecht's statement that “ ACUTETÀ” was another
name of "QASIÀST” I have to say that it needs to be verified. In this
connection I have to observe that the Bikaner MS of his a&tq dated
A. D. 1652 was copied by one "TTÀ ST ” as stated in the Catalogue. It is
possible to suppose that '' दत्तमिश्र" in an abbreviated form of “ कृष्णदत्त-
मिश्र" but I cannot say if कृष्णदत्तमिश्र and वनमालिमिश्र are identical. Possibly
दत्तमिश्र, who copied in A. D. 1652 the MS of the कुरुक्षेत्रप्रदीप of वनमालिमिश्र,
was a different person, though he might have been a member of the
family of gaatfefÆST.
A Madhva writer of the name वनमालिमिश्र of the भारद्वाजगोत्र and
hailing from the neighbourhood of Vịndāvana composed Afganiga1 and
other works between c. A. D. 1575 and 1650. On folio 57 of MS No. 718

3. Some Authors of The Ārde Family*
And Their Chronology - Between A. D. 1600 and 1825

HALL1 in his Bibliography refers to Mss of the works of a writer on
logic by name " Kșşņabhat Arde " but indicates no chronology for them.
Dr. Satischandra Vidyabhusana in his History of Indian Logic 2 refers to
this author as Křşņabhatta Ade and states that he died about 150 years
ago. If the statement made by Vidyabhusana is correct we shall have to
suppose that Kṛṣṇabhatta Arde ( not Ade ) died about A. D. 1771. This
statement, however, seems to be wrong as will be seen from the evidence
to be recorded in this paper, which shows that this author was living at
Benares thirty years after the probable date of his death mentioned by
· Vidyabhusana, who unfortunately records no evidence for his surmise.
Aufrecht records about 74 works of this author. In CC II, 23 and
CC III, 26 Aufrecht calls him son of Ranganātha. In CC III, 114 he in.
forms us that one रङ्गनाथ आरड, son of महादेव, wrote दशकुमारचरितपूर्वपीठिकासार
( Stein 81). Hall in his edition of the Vasavadatta (Bib. Ind. 1859 ) states
that a rumour had reached him regarding a commentary on the Vāsava-
dattā by Krsnabhatta Arde but Aufrecht makes no mention of this com-

mentary. Hall further informs us in foot-note 1 on p. 47 of his Preface
to Vāsavadattā as follows :-- Krşņabhatta was “a Maratha of Benares ; son
of Ranganātha and pupil of one Hari. Among his works are huge com-
mentaries on the fauterinay, ngraft and forgift. The second is called for TFT
or गदाधरीविवृत्ति; and the third मजषा or जगदीशतोषिणी. The गदाधरी is by
गदाधरभट्टाचार्य. The जगदीशी by जगदीशतकालंकारभट्टाचार्य. They annotated res.
pectively the whole and a part of the दीधिति of रघुनाथ शिरोमणिभट्टाचार्य which
consists of notes on the first two Sections of Gangesa Upadhyāya's arafaar-
Alo, a celebrated treatise of Nyāya philosophy. ”
M. M. Professor P. V. Kane makes the following remarks regarding
the above author but indicates no chronology for his works :--
" Comm. ( on निर्णयसिन्धु A. D. 1612 ) रत्नमाला or दीपिका by कृष्ण-
HE OTS.” 1
"कृष्णभट्ट आर्डे ( or आरड ), son of रघुनाथ of Benares ; Author of
TOATZT alias <tfo=1 on FAUTIFT of A31ETHE ” 2
The foregoing remarks of several scholars like Hall, Aufrecht, Kane,
reveal that Kșsṇabhatta Arde was not only a great logician but also a
learned commentator on works pertaining to dharmasastra and Kavya.
Though I have not before me any Mss of the several works of this author
I shall record in this paper some contemporary evidence which conclusi.
vely proves the chronology of this author.
The India Office Library Catalogue 3 contains a description of 11
fragments of the Kāśikā of Krsnabhatta Arde. This description is concluded
with the remarks:--"Date of this part ( 11th ) haq 964 Phía agaat 98
alterat. All parts were written about the same time." These reinarks
show that the above fragments were copied in Samvat 1857 = A. D.
1801. Elsewhere 4 in this Catalogue Mss of Bala#FF741 on the great by
this author are described but this description contains no dates of the Mss.

Some Authors of the Arde Family
I was under the impression that Kșşņabhatta Arờe was a Deśastha
Mahārāstra Brahmin. My friend Mr. Raghunātha Shastri Patankar of
Rajapur informed me, however, that there is a family of Karhādā Brah-
mins 1 of the name “Arde” now residing in the Rajapur Taluka of the
Ratnagiri District and that he is in touch with the present members of
this family. I have requested him to send me a genealogy of this family
to enable me to see if our Kșşņabhatta Arde, the logician, belonged to
this family originally and then migrated to Benares for his education.
The following evidence shows that Krsnabhatta Arde was living at
Benares about A. D. 1801-02, the date of the India Office Ms of his work
referred to above.
In a Marathi Magazine 2 containing materials for the history of the
Kāyastha Prabhus the history of a caste-dispute during the time of Peshwa
Bajirao II is recorded. In this account of the dispute 3 a letter from Bena.
res Pandits is reproduced. It is addressed to the Poona Brahmins, and is
signed by about 81 Brahmins of Benares grouped as follows:-
40--Maharastra Brahmins ---संमतोयमर्थः (महाराष्ट्रानां )
4-Vājasaneyi Brahmins-
, - (वाजसनेयिनां)
21-Chittapavan Brahmins-
- (चित्तपावनानां)
9-Karhada Brahmins--
( करहाटकानां)
7--Karnataka Brahmins-
- (करनाटकानां)
81
The first name in the Karhātaka group we find is the name
“ कृष्णंभटजी अर्डे," while the sixth name is " बाळमुकुंद अ." The letter is dated
Saka 1723 or Samvat 1858 4 = A. D. 1801. I feel no doubt that “ कृष्णंभटजी
1 In the Gotravali of Karhada Brahmins with me I find the surname " Arde " with gotras
(1) काश्यप and (2) भारद्वाज. It is necessary to examine the works of Krsnabhatta Arde and find
out if he has recorded his own gotra incidentally.

" of this letter of A. D. 1801 is no other than “Kșsṇabhatta Arợe,” the
writer of several works on logic and other subjects mentioned by me in
this paper. If this identification is accepted we have evidence to believe
that this author flourished between say A. D. 1750 and 1825 or so. As the
India Office Library Ms of TATAAFF91 is dated A. D. 1801 we have to
suppose that Krşņabhatta was a full-fledged logician by A. D. 1800 and
that many of his works on logic may have been completed before this
year. Presuming now that he was about 50 years old in A. D. 1801 when
he consented to a letter of decision in a caste-dispute we may reasonably
allow for him a life-period between A. D. 1750 and 1825 (about 75 years).
The Ms of GTFATafaqaattor mentioned by Stein 1 as the work
of “ TG7a187 BTITT” son of AEIT consists of 19 folios (complete ). This
रङ्गनाथ seems to be the same as the father of कृष्णभट्ट आर्डे, the logician,
who was also called Eat as we have already seen. The genealogy of this
logician will now be as follows:--
RETCa (C. A. D. 1675-1725)
Son
TETA1 ( a. of TralafayaqtFIATT )
(C. A. D. 1700-1775)
नारायणभट्ट
Son
(A, D. 1750-1825) ESITHE (C. A. D. 1750-1825 )
नारायणभट्ट mentioned by कृष्णभट्ट आर्डे as his brother seems to be dif.
ferent from his namesake, the son of GATITHE. 2 This aTTITU GEHTETT STITE
composed a work on dharmaśāstra called the įTIJAIT of which Aufrecht
(CC II, 32 ) records the following Mss. :-
"गृह्याग्निसागर or प्रयोगसार by नारायणभट्ट. Bhau Daji 102, IO. 48. 1815.
Rgb. 292, Stein 87."
"गृह्याग्निसागर alias प्रयोगसार by नारायणभट्ट, son of लक्ष्मीधरभट्ट surnamed
31173 (179), quotes TTAL'ETTETTEyt on garant's HIST ON ST9FAFA, T giftara,
प्रयोगरत्न, निर्णयसिन्धु, भट्टोजिदीक्षित, परशुरामप्रताप and रामवाजपेयी and his own
STIGA1TT. Later than 1650 A. D.”
Ms “Rgb. 292" in the above entry of Aufrecht is identical with Ms
No. 292 of 1884–87 in the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute,
Poona. There is another Ms of the work in the above library, viz., No. 63
1 Cata. of Jammu Mss by Peterson (1894), p. 81.

of 1895-1902 which is dated Saka 1693 = A. D. 1771. Ms No. 292 of 1884.
87 is dated Saka 1649 = A. D. 1727. It is thus clear that नारायण लक्ष्मीधर
आरड, the author of the गृह्याग्निसागर, flourished earlier than A. D. 1727 and
later than A. D. 1612, the date of निर्णयसिन्धु, which is quoted on folio 122a
of Ms No. 292 of 1884-87 1 as follows:-
arou “ निर्णयसिंधौ पाराशरमाधवीये कात्यायनः"
On the strength of the above evidence we can assign this author to
the period A.D. 1650-1725 and consequently he is entirely different from
नारायण रङ्गनाथ आरडे, the brother of कृष्णभट्ट आरडे (A. D. 1750 to 1825). The
Ms of this work in the India Office Library is a late copy dated Saka
1741 (=A.D. 1819). Professor H. D. Velankar has described two Mss of
this work in his catalogue of the B.B.R.A. Society's Mss.,2 but these Mss
bear no dates. The work is a compilation treating of rites regarding the
maintenance of the sacred fire, and rules of expiation in cases of
irregularities. The author notes some Marathi equivalents for Sanskrit
words on folio 8 (Ms No. 292 of 1884-87). It is now clear that the author
of the IUTAT belongs to a branch of the Arde family which I cannot

Some Authors of the Arde Family
On this address there are signatures of more than 67 Mabārāstra
Brahmins, etc., among which the above names occur. I am inclined to
think that these persons are identical with कृष्णभट्ट आर्डे and बाळमुकुंद आर्डे
of the 1801 A. D. letter from the Benares Pandits to Poona Pandits
already referred to by me in this paper. Though the above signatures are
not followed by the surnames of the writers in the 1796 address the
circumstantial evidence is strong enough to support my identification of
these writers with their namesakes in the 1801 letter. In fact I find that
many signatories are common to both the documents as will be seen from
the following comparison :-

It appears clear to me that Krsnabhatta Arde, the logician, was a signa-
tory to the Sanskrit address to Warren Hastings, an English transla-
tion of which by Mr. Wilkins is found on pp. 755-768 of the Debates
of House of Lords, London, 1797. Krsna bhatta did not, therefore, die
about A. D. 1771, as suggested by Dr. S. Vidyabhusana in his History of
Indian Logic.
Our Krsnabbatta Arde was a junior contemporary of the celebrated
author Bālambhatta Pāyagunde, the author of the Balambhatti, who is
assigned by M. M. Professor P. V. Kane 1 to the period A. D. 1730-1820 and
to whom Colebrooke had entrusted the compilation of a work called
Dharmaśāstra Sangraha about A. D. 1801. On the Benares letter of A. D.
1801 to which Krşņabhatta Arde is a signatory we find the signature of

" बाळंभटजी पायगुंडे " who is no other than his namesake in the employ of
Colebrooke in May 1801, 1
It is difficult to fix the chronology of the several works of Kșşņa-
bhatta Arde. I have already observed that the India Office Library Ms of
the Kāśikā of this author is dated A. D. 1801. He must have written his
works on nyāya prior to A. D. 1800 or so. In his commentary on Gadā.
dhara's दोषसामान्यलक्षण our author refers to his parents कमला and रङ्गनाथ as
residing in heaven ( STATTFat: FATITE-TT1Prett:). This statement
shows that Kršņabhatta composed the commentary in question when
his parents were no longer living. Possibly his parents died before
A. D. 1800.
P-S.-I have assigned FITI TU JEHOVET ITÈ to the period A. D. 1650-
1725. This conclusion is corroborated by the following additional
evidence:-
(1) A nirnayapatra A. D. 1657 contains the following endorsement
-"AT AITIOTHE STITÈ gatalpa:" ( Vide pp. 78-81 of faaahe
#TU by R. S. Pimputkar, Bombay, 1926 ).
(2) H. P. Shastri [Notices, III, 1907, Calcutta ] describes a Ms of en
Alftal by ATTITOHE OTIŠ, which is dated Samvat 1783 = A. D.
1727. We have already pointed out that the B. O. R. I. Ms of
TEILWEITT of ATTITTHE BAŠ is dated Śake 1649 = A. D. 1727.

Vyakhyasudha *
Dated A. D. 1649
And Identification of his Patron Kirtisimha of the Bagheta Dynasty
(Between A. D. 1620 and 1660 )
AUFRECHT 1 records several MSS of the commentary of Bhānuji
Dīkşita on the "Amarakośa,” called "Vyākhyāsudhā . " Some of these are
already described in the descriptive Catalogues of MSS so far published.
Judging by this description we find in the first instance few MSS with
any dates recorded in them. The India Office Library contains two MSS 2
bearing dates A. D. 1800 and 1806 while the Bodleian Library, Oxford,
contains three MSS, 3 one of which is dated A. D. 1793 while the re.
maining two are dated about A. D. 1700 and 1800 respectively. 4
In view of the absence of dated MSS of the “ Vyākhyāsudbā” be.
longing to the 17th century, to the earlier half of which its author is
generally assigned, I was interested to find that the MS of this com-
mentary noted by Aufrecht, viz., “ Bhr 200” was a contemporary copy
of the work. This MS is identical with MS No. 200 of 1882-83 in the
Government MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. It contains
the commentary for the 2nd Kāņda of the “ Amarakośa” and is well
preserved in spite of its age. It ends as follows:-

The chronogram containing the date of the copy is represented by
the words TT, 3737, 3773, 7-5 — Samvat 1705 or A. D. 1649. If this
date is correct we must look upon the MS bearing this date as a con-
temporary copy of the “ Vyākhyāsud hā ” of Bhānuji. Though this MS
contains commentary for only the 2nd Kānda of the “ Amarakośa" its
value for a critical edition of the “ Vyākhyāsudhā” for this Kānda at
least should be very great as compared with the late MSS of the com-
mentary. The colophon of this contemporary MS is also very important
as it confirms similar colophons in the MSS of this commentary of later
date. It is clear from this colophon that the “ Vyākhyāsudhā" was com.
posed by Bhānuji Dīkṣita, son of Bhattoji Dikṣita by order of Kirtisimba-
deva, " who was a prince of the Bagbela dynasty, ruling over the Mahī.
dhara territory. 1 As the MS is dated A. D. 1649, Bhānuji must have
composed this commentary many years earlier than this date.
I shall now try to identify the patron of Bhānuji Dīkşita, who
belonged to the Baghela dynasty and whose name was Kirtisimha. The
colophon of A. D. 1649 quoted above gives the following particulars about
Bhānuji's patron:-
(1) He was of the Baghela dynasty ( aitánicha ).
(2) He was ruler of Mahīdhara territory ( gapura).
(3) He was a prince ( श्रीमहाराजकुमार ) of the name कीर्तिसिंह.
I am of opinion that Kīrtisimba, the Baghela patron of Bhānuji, is
identical with Fateh Singh, the founder of the Sohawal State in Baghel-
1 Both att fåfågea ” and “ Elefaqj” need to be identified. I have tried to
identify "alfathe" in this paper. " Aglafaquis possibly identical with Maihar
State now under the Baghel Khanda Political Agency as suggested by my friend Dr. R. N.
Dandekar. Maihar was originally a dependency of Rewa but later it went into the possession
of the Bundela Raja of Panna (vide p. 189 of Vol. IX of Imp. Gazet., London, 886 ).
2 Vide p. 47 of Imp. Gazetteer of India, Vol. XIII, London, 1887.--Sohawal-The State
of Echawal was formerly a portion of Rewa territory but about the middle of the 16th Century,
when Amarsingh was ruler of Rewa, his son Fate Singh threw off his father's authority and
established his independence as Chief of Sohawal. His descendant Lal Amansingh was found in
possession on the British occupation of Baghel Khanda and was consequently confirmed in his
State on his tendering a deed of allegiance. In consequence of the improvidence and misrule
of its Chiefs the State has more than once come under British management. It was last made
over in 1871 free cf debt to the present Raja of Soha wal Lal Sher Jang Bahadur Singh, who
is by race & Baghel Rajput. A small police force is maintained of about 50 men.

Bhānuji Dikṣita's Vyākhyāsudbā
khanda in Central India . My reasons for the above identification are
as follows:--
(1) The name "Kirtisimha" mentioned by Bhānuji Dīkşita is only a
paraphrase of the name " Fatesingh."
(2) Bhānuji Dīkşita 1 may be assigned to a period A. D. 1600 to 1660.
His patron Fatesingh was living at this time.2
(3) It appears that Kīrtisimha or Fatesingh had already founded the
Sohawal Kingdom when Bhānuji wrote his commentary as Bhānuji
calls his patron " the ruler of Mahīdhara territory ” ( HetaTaTaleta ).
It is quite probable that " HETETT " is equivalent to “ Maihar ” and
“hetetlaga" means the “ Maihar State ” which was the dependency
of Rewa and is now under the Baghelakhanda Political Agency as stated
in the Gazetteer. 3 As the town of Maihar is about 40 miles from Rewa,
Fatesing may have made it his headquarters, when he threw off his
father's authority. His brother Anūpasing was a minor when he came
to the gādī of Rewa and ruled between A. D. 1640 and 1660. In view of
this chronology for his brother's rule at Rewa we may safely assign him
to the period A. D. 1620 to 1660 or so and make him a junior of Bhānuji
1 Vide my paper on the date of Bhattoji Dik sita in the Annals ( Tirupati Institute ) Vol.
I, pp. 117-127. As Bhttoji's career ended about A. D. 1620 we may assign bis son Bhānuji to
the period A. D. 1600 to 1660.

Bhattoji and Bhānuji may be given here:-

Dīksita, who calls him TIFFAIT, whose father Amarsing ruled from A. D.
1624 to 1640. 1
If it is possible to determine when Fatesing or Kīrtisimha became
the ruler of the Mahīdhara territory we can easily fix the earlier limit
to the date of Bhānuji's Vyākhyāsudbā, the later limit being of course
A. D. 1649, the date of the MS of the 2nd Kānda of this commentary
already described in this paper. As Anūpasing, the brother of Fatesing,
ruled between A. D. 1640 and 1660 and as he was a minor when he came
to the gādī of Rewa in A. D. 1640, we may not be wrong in assigning
Fatesing to the period A. D. 1620 to 1660 as we have remarked above.
It is also possible to suppose that he threw off the authority of his father
some years before A. D. 1640, when obviously he lost his father and the
question of succession arose. If these statements, which I have based on
the notes sent to me by the late Diwan Bahadur Janaki Prasad, are correct
we may safely suggest that Bhānuji composed his “ Vyākhyāsudhā"
between A. D. 1620 and A. D. 1640. In making this suggestion I have
presumed that Fatesing, the patron of Bhānuji, was born about A. D. 1620
and that he was about 20 years old when his father died in A. D. 1640 and
was succeeded by the minor brother Anūpasing.
In the foregoing discussion I have made use of the scanty information
in my possession regarding Fatesing Baghel whom I regard as the patron
of Bhānuji Dīkṣita. How Bhānuji came into contact with this prince I
cannot say at present.
Tavernier visited Benares in A. D. 1666. He refers in his Travels 2
to a college at Benares founded by Raja Jaising ( A. D. 1621-1667 ) for
the education of the youth of good families. Is it possible to suppose that
Fatesing or Kirtisimha may have had some contact with this college where
some of the contemporary Rajput princes got their education at the hands
of Brahmin pandits of Benares ? As it seems, however, that Fatesing
Baghel was a contemporary of Mirza Raja Jaising, he may not have
received his education at the above college where the sons of Jaising got
their education. We have, therefore, to presume that the contact of
Bhānuji with Fatesing was independent of the above college like that of
1 The chronology of the Baghela rulers given in this paper is based on the notes supplied
to me by my friend the late Diwan Bahadur Janaki Prasad, M. A., LL. B., the Adviser to H. H.
the Maharaja of Rewa. He was in constant correspondence with me on many matters of histo-
rical interest and I put on record my deep appreciation of his critical insight and indefatigable
industry in investigating the history of the Rewa State. Unfortunately he died in 1938.

nātha M. Ränade (p. 50 of Vol. 17, 1941, of B. B. R. A. S. Journal ).

Kavindrācārya Sarasvatī with the Mughal Court and the Rajput princes
who thronged at this court in the 17th century. 1
- I have identified hettage with the Maihar State and Kirtisimha
Baghel with Fatesing Baghel, whom the Gazetteer calls the founder of the
Sohawal State. As both the Maihar and Sohawal States are near 2 each
other in the Baghel Khanda agency it is possible to suppose that Hetafaqat
comprised area belonging to both these states, when Fatesing became the
ruler of this area and perhaps made hett or Maihar as his headquarters.
I await more light on this question from close students of the history of
Baghel Khanda, who may be able to settle the exact limits of the Agterfaqe
over which Fatesing ruled after throwing off his father's authority some
time before A. D. 1640. At present I have no detailed knowledge of the
history of the Maihar or Sohawal States subsequent to the rule of Fatesing
or even before it and hence cannot say anything in this matter with
certainty.
Curious views 3 have been current regarding the caste of Brahmins
to which Bhattoji Dīkşita belonged. Some say he was a Deśastha Brahmin,
while others say that he was a Sarasvata Brahmin. According to the
generally accepted view he was a Telanga Brahmin. In view of these
opinions I was surprised to find in the colophon 4 of a MS of the Vyākhyā.
sudhā the statement that it was composed by Rāmāśrama, (1) the pupil of
Bhattoji Dikṣita and (2) of Gurjara caste. This statement adds one more
caste to the list of castes, to which Bhattoji's family is supposed to have
belonged. I shall deal in a separate paper with the validity of the tradition
that Rāmāśrama was the name of Bhānuji Dīkşita after he became a
sanyāsin. The colophon of the Tanjore MS which refers to the Gurjara
1 Vide my paper on “Kavindrācārya Sarasvati at the Mughal Court " (pp. 1--16 of Annals
of Tirupati 8. V. Ori. Institute, Vol. I, Part IV). The poet Jayarāma in his graphiyafasla-
ziq (Poona, 1922), composed about A. D. 1658, refers to a “aasta: tatage " at the
court of King Sha haji, father of Shivaji the Great.

caste of Rāmāśrama has not much historical value as it is contradicted by
the colophon of A. 1). 1649 which neither refers to Rāmāśrama nor to his
Gurjara caste as will be clear from this colophon already quoted elsewhere
in this paper.
Presuming that Bhānuji Dīkşita and Rāmāśrama 1 are identical we
may infer that Vatsarāja, a pupil of Rāmāśrama, in the following verse
of his " Vārāṇasīdarpaņatīkā” composed in Samvat 1698 (A. D. 1641)
refers to Bhānuji Dīksita after he became a sanyāsin :-
" भट्टोजिदीक्षितं नत्वा रामाश्रमगुरुं पुनः ।
वत्सराजः करोत्येतां काशीदर्पणकाशिकाम् ॥"
Bhānuji Dikşita may have become a sanyāsin before A. D. 1641. It is also
possible to surmise that he composed the “ Vyākhyāsud hā” before he
became a sanyāsin.
- I have already referred in this paper to the importance of the MS
of A. D. 1649, viz., No. 200 of 1882-83 for purposes of textual criticism.
This importance will be better understood by a test comparison of the
text of the “ Vyākhyāsudbā” as represented by the printed edition and
that found in the MS of A. D. 1649. The inflated character of the text
in the printed edition is apparent from the Appendix to this paper pre-
pared by Mr. M. M. Patkar.
The authentic life-history of the scholars who flourished in the 16th
and 17th centuries is difficult to reconstruct on the strength of contem-
porary evidence. I have tried in this paper to collect and discuss some
useful data regarding Bhānuji Dīkşita and his patron, which I hope will
attract the attention of senior scholars, from whom I expect to get some
more information on the subject than what I have gathered in this short
paper.

5. Kavikaustubha, an unknown Work On Poetics by
Raghunatha Manohara And its Chronology-
Between A. D. 1675 And 1700 *
Aufrecht mentions no work of the title कविकौस्तुभ. Dr. S. K. De's
History of Sanskrit Poetics also contains no mention of any work of this
title. Recently I came across a Ms of this work through the favour of
Vaidya Sivarāma Raghunātha Khāndekar of Nasik. He was under the
impression that this work was composed by his grand-father Rāghava
Kavi 1 or Raghunatha Appā Khāņdekar of Punyastambha or Puņtāmbe
in the Ahmednagar District of the Bombay Presidency. On examination
I find that the Ms of planteau is not a work of Rāghava Kavi but that
it belonged to him as I find from the endorsement towards the end
of the Ms. 2
IA
As this work on rhetorics is unknown to Sanskritists I shall describe
the present Ms and determine the chronology of its author Raghunātha
Manohara. The Ms begins:-
“॥ श्री गणेशाय नमः ॥

1 I am preparing a special paper on the unknown works of Rāghava Kavi who flourished
between A.D. 1758 and 1820 or so.
2 This MS contains 25 folios and is written on country paper. It is well preserved and
appears to be about 150 years old. It contains the following post-colophon endorsement :

Joshi). In some colophons the author is called " कविकुलावतंस रघुनाथपंडित " (See fol. 95). In
the Ms of कविकौस्तुभ also he is called "कविकुलावतंस रघुनाथपंडित.” The author refers
to himself as " कविराघव " in verse 2 at the commencement:-
" सदुक्तिभाजां कविराघवेण वितन्यते वैद्यविलास एषः." The work is styled as " महाकाव्य".
No. 639 of 1895–1902 is a very modern copy without date.
In the Gotrāvali of Konkanastha or Chitpāvana Brahmins we find the surname Haler.
The Gotra of the मनोहर family is भारद्वाज (हिरण्यकेशी), The MS of the वैद्यविलास described in
the India Office Catalogue mentions मनोहर as the surname of its author रघुनाथपंडित.

Appaya is A. D. 1554-1626 (72 years) according to his descen-
dants while others assign Appaya to the period A. D. 1520-
1593 (Vide p. 341 of भट्टोजी-दीक्षित-ज्ञातिविवेक in Marathi by Rao
Bahadur W. A. Bambardekar, Bombay, 1939 ).
It will be seen from the above references that the latest works
mentioned by the author of the कविकौस्तुभ are (1) मुहूर्तचिन्तामणि of A. D. 1600
and (2) कुवलयानंद of Appaya Diksita ( A. D. 1550-1600 or so ). We must,
therefore, conclude that he flourished after about A. D. 1650. As our
author seems to be identical with his name-sake कविकुलावतंस रघुनाथपंडित

मनोहर, author of the वैद्यविलास composed in A. D. 1697, the date of कविकौस्तुभ
may be between say A. D. 1675 and 1700 or so..
So far only one work of this author, viz. Qafaga on medicine was
known. The present account of the fameT# proves conclusively that he
composed this work on poetics as well. We have seen above that in this
work he refers to and quotes from a work on prosody called the छन्दोरत्नावली
composed by him “ मद्विरचितछन्दोरत्नावल्याम् ” in two places. As no such
work has been discovered so far I quote below the verses from this work
as quoted by रघुनाथ मनोहरः-
Folio ka-"अत्र छन्दसि मद्विरचितछन्दोरत्नावल्याम् ॥

FFolio 8a : - " अत्र प्रथमचतुर्थचरणयोर्यतिभङ्गे । छन्दोरत्नावल्याम्

चतुर्दशमथ क्रमात्सकलभाग्यवारांनिधे
श्रुतिद्वयसरीसृपैर्विरतिरङ्ग पृथ्वी मता ॥"
It is clear from the above three verses quoted by our author that
he composed this छन्दोरत्नावलि earlier than his composition of the कविकौस्तुभ.
Perhaps a Ms of Raghunatha's छन्दोरत्नावलि may be discovered hereafter.
The present paper has added two more works to the only work galasia of
Raghunātha, known to the students of the history of Sanskrit literature. It
has also given us the names of his father भिकंभट्ट and his grandfather कृष्ण-
पंडित not found in the Mss of the वैद्यविलास as we find them described in our
catalogues 1 of Sanskrit Mss. The genealogy of tatt Halat thus goes
back to about A. D. 1600.
1. B. B. R. A. S. Mss Catalogue by H. D. Velankar, Vol. I, 1925, describes 2 Mss of the
Vaidyavilāsa. He describes the work as follows on p. 70: -
. "A popular treatise on medicine in 10 chapters (tarangas) composed in 1697 A. D. by
Raghunathapandita of the Manohara family and a resident of चपावती (भागलपूर). For another
Ms of the work having only 6 chapters Cl. I. O. No. 2695. See also Ulwar Cata, p. 72."

Studies in Indian Literary History
As regards the native place of Raghunātha we learn from the India
Office Ms of the galagia that it was ziraat which has been wrongly
identified with Bhagalpur by Dr. Eggeling 1 in his description of this Ms.
As the author was a Deccani Brahmin his residence must have been
somewhere in the Deccan. This suggestion gets confirmation from the
identification of siqraat with Chaul as we find it in the following verse in
the Sivabhārata of Kavindra Paramānanda composed for Shivaji before
A. D. 1674:-
Chap. XXVIII, 59 — Here the Mogul General Shaista Khān orders
another Muslim Sardar to conquer aqiqat :-
" चंपावत्यथ कल्याणपुरं भीमपुरी तथा।
पणवल्ली पुनर्नागस्थानं कार्यं त्वयात्मसात् ॥ ५९॥"?
Apart from the usage of the name zipiaat for Chaul as found in a
poem of the latter part of the 17th century, when Raghunātha Manohara
(Continued from the last page)
The Ms ends :-" इति द्रव्यप्रमाणम् ।

"Vaidyavilasa......by Raghunatha (or Raghava ) Pandita Kavisvara of the Manohara
Karla a resident of चपावतीपुर ( Bhagalpur)". Mr. Nandalal Dey on p. 228 of his Geographical,
Dictionary refers to Chaul as follows :-
"Chaul - 39aat, 25 miles South of Bombay; it is the Semylla of the Periplus of
the Erythrean Sea"
__(See also p. 46. Ibid and DaCunha's History of Chaul and Bassein, pp. 3--11)...

lived at this place we may note here the fact that Chaul or Revdandā (in
the Alibagh Sub-divison of the Kolābā District of the Bombay Presi-
dency) is a place of great antiquity. “Under the names of quaat and
jaatea local Hindu traditions trace it to the times when Krishna reigned
in Gujarat.” 1
We may now sum up the facts so far brought forth regarding the
life-history and literary activity of teate as follows:--
(1) Raghunātha Manohara composed the following works:--
(1) galagie on Medicine composed in A.D. 1697.
(2) छन्दोरत्नावलि a work on prosody mentioned and quoted in the
pfa RTECH — No MS discovered so for.
(3) कविकौस्तुभ on Poetics represented by only one Ms in the
possession of Vaidya S. A. Khandekar of Nasik. This Ms
belonged to Rāghava Apā Khandekar (A.D. 1758–1825).
(2) The genealogy of Raghunātha as recorded by him in his
कविकौस्तुभ is as follows:-
şsuyfta — son f*72 — son syarat
(c. 1600 A.D.)-(c. 1650 A.D. )--( A.D. 1697 ).
(3) The native place of Raghunātha Manohara was f591aat which
appears to be identical with Chaul about 25 miles south of
Bombay.
(4) In his æfaktegu Raghunātha mentions and quotes from the
following works which are not recorded in Aufrecht's Catalogus
Catalogorum :
(i) a164eT.
(ii) His own greitaaS.
(iii) $180baas.
(iv) *095TITET.
(v) TEUTATEA.
1. Vide p. 376 Imperial Gazetteer Vol. III, (1885). From the History of Chaul recorded here
we learn that Chaul was known to Ptolemy (A.D. 150), to the author of the Periplus of the
Erythrean Sea (A.D. 247) and to Hwen Thsang (A.D. 642). The Arab travellers of the 10th, 11th
and 12th centuries also refer to it. The subsequent travellers to refer to Chaul are :-(1) Nikitin
(A.D. 1470), Jean Hugues (A.D. 1583). In 1505 A.D. the Portuguese first appeared at Chaul,

the second represents the date of the copy,

Between A. D. 1625 and 1700. *
Aufrecht records the following manuscripts of Śivakośa by Sivadatta
with his own commentary:-
CC, 1,647 -- " Taxtar lexicon by Sivadatta Oxf. 195a." 1
CC, II, 154—" faqaata lexicon by Sivadatta Comm.-Sivaprakāśa by
the same, Stein 54." 2
Both the MSS of the Sivakośa and its commentary Śivaprakāśa
mentioned by Aufrecht are inaccessible to me for study and analysis.
Subsequent to the publication of Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum the
B. O. R. Institute published a list 8 of MSS added to the Government MSS
Library. In this list we find a complete MS of the Sivakośa with the
Sivaprakāśa, viz. No. 616 of 1895–1902. As the lexicon was composed in
A. D. 1677 and as it is a compilation based on many early lexicons and
other works it is worthwhile recording a complete list of the works and
authors mentioned in it especially because no such list has been given
either by Aufrecht or Stein. Prof. Rāmāyatāra Sarmā also refers to this
lexicon casually in his survey 4 of lexicons. Aufrecht 5 mentions HTAYETT
as the work of Sivadatta and records only one MS of it, viz. "L. 1481.”
This MS has been described by Rajendralal Mitra in his Notices of
* Poona Orientalist, Vol. VII, Parts 1 and 2, pp. 66-70.

Aufrecht has pointed out the date of the lexicon viz. Saka 1599 ( = A.D. 1677) represented by
the chronogram "aqugfafe" at the end of the work.

Sanskrit MSS. 1 It was copied in A.D. 1719 and is perhaps the oldest dated
MS of Sivadatta's works. At any rate it is removed in point of time by
about 42 years from the Sivakosa and its commentary. Sivadatta 2 was a
physician trained under his own father Caturbhuja and other eminent and
learned physicians of his time as stated by him in verse 2 at the close of

may be looked upon as the senior contemporary of Sivadatta, who
composed his lexicon in A. D. 1677.
It appears that Sivadatta was a learned physician and had an equally
learned son of the name Krşņadatta, who composed, a commentary on the
Dravyagunasataśloki of Trimalla. 1 This commentary is called Dipikā
or Dravyadipikā. Aufrecht records the following MSS of this commentary :-
CC, I, 120 --" Oudh IX, 26 " and "NP, V, 30"
** CC, II, 51 -- " Rgb 922" ( by Euca son of istag7 ). The MS “Rgb
922 ” is identical with No. 922 of 1884-87 in the Government MSS Lib-
rary at the B. O. R. Institute. This MS contains a corrupt colophon as
follows: --
folio 33 -- " fanafazakararajafaafarazagart | ECUIÇT: paa:

It is clear from this colophon that cugat was the son of feragat, who
was himself the son of alfa. In verse 2 at the beginning of the work
Krsnadatta refers to his own authorship of the work as follows:--
"TAGHetfeat oft FETUEE: I.

this fracalist with his namesake the author of the Śivakośa needs to be
examined. Śivakośa was composed in A. D. 1677 by Sivadatta and it is
highly probable that this author, who was a junior contemporary of
Kavīndrācārya Sarasvati may have joined other Benares Pandits in their
chorus of congratulations offered to Kavindrācārya on the occasion of the
abolition of the pilgrim tax at Benares through the successful intervention
of Kavīndrācārya with Emperor Shah Jahan ( A. D. 1628–1658 ).
The editors of the Kavindracandrodaya make the following remarks
regarding Sivadatta Miśra in their Introduction (p. viii):--
" 44. Śivadatta Misra, son of Caturbhuja, author of Sivakosa written
in 1677 and Samjñā Samuccaya (med.) (CC. I, 649a ). Prose passages
1-14 on p. 26.”
Evidently they tentatively follow the identification of the $. Miśra
of the Kavindracandrodaya with his namesake, the author of the Sivakośa
as suggested by Aufrecht. We have, however, to see if the prose pass.
ages ascribed to Sivadatta Miśra furnish any conclusive proof about this
identity. My examination of prose passages shows nothing in them to
prove the above identity except the identity of names indicated by the
expression.
“ STATTĀSTĀTNTTTITETITE: "
Prof. Velankar describes a MS 1 of a commentary on the Rasahrdaya
of Govinda. This commentary was composed by one Th Ff, son of
महेशमिश्र of the Kurala family ( कुरलवंशपयोधि ). Has this चतुर्भुजमिश्र
of the कुरलवंश any connection with the कर्पूरीयचतुर्भुजमिश्र ? This question
cannot be answered at present.

7. Exact Date of the Advaitasudhā of Laksmana Pandita
(A. D. 1663) and his possible Identity with
Laksmanarya, the Vedānta teacher of
Nilakantha Caturdhara, the Commentator
of the Mahabharata *
of the Mohouhotel
My friend Mr. K. M. K. Sarmā, Curator of the Anup Sanskrit Lib.
rary, Bikaner, has just published a note, on anteqargata (a Dissertation
on the Raghuvamsa ) by Lakşmaņa Pandita. 1 I note below some points
from Mr. Sarma's note :-
(1) The only work of LP ( = Jennifea) well-known to scholars
is his commentary arafai on the Rāghavapāņdaviya.
(2) FAUT the author of the Yoga-Candrikā (CC, I, 536 ) and
लक्ष्मण the author of सारचन्द्रिका are identical.
(3) There are two MSS of the Yoga-Candrikā 2 in the Anup Library,
Bikaner ( Nos. 4404 and 4405 ). One of these MSS, viz. No. 4405 is dated
Samvat 1747 (= A. D. 1690 ).
(4) LP was of Kaundinya Gotra. He was the son of Datta and
Gojāmbikā. as
(5) LP was the younger brother of Gaņeśa and Raghunātha of
Benares.
(6) Nāgeśa and Nārāyaṇa, his maternal uncles, were his precep-
tors in medical science.
(7) उत्तमश्लोकतीर्थ ( the author of लघुवार्तिकटीका ) was his preceptor in
Advaita.
Poona Orientalist, Vol. X, Nos. 1 and 2, Pages 1-7.
1 Vide pp. 69-72 of Jour. of Ganganatha Jha Research Institute, Allahabad, Vol. II, Part 1
(November, 1944 ).
2 There is a MS of the Yoga-Candrikā in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute
(No. 763 of 1882-83 ). It is called Vaidyaka Yoga-Candrikā. In verse 3 LP refers to his gurus
in medicine, viz. नागनाथ and नारायण as follows :-
Folio 6 — " fazanai ganajari qui aiagaralsh.” This MS is dated śaka 1778
( = A. D. 1856 ). The Ms belonged to 3/5, Heft grioitas ataigaiet#. It was copied
from the original belonging to "114 ACTA TITT.”

(8) He pays his homage to TIASA also. This Rāmāśrama is
possibly identical with his name-sake, the son of Bhattoji Dīkşita. If this
identity is correct we get about A. D. 1650 as the upper limit for the date
of LP.
(9) The lower limit for the date of LP is A. D. 1690, the date of
the Bikaner MS of his Yoga-Candrikā.
(10) We can assign LP to the latter half of the 17th century, i.e.
between A. D. 1650 and 1700.
: (11) There is a MS of the Fiftaigaar of LP in the Anup Library,
Bikaner. It is a philosophical and grammatical dissertation on the
Raghuvamsa of Kālidāsa. The MS contains 66 folios (84" x 31") con-
taining the commentary upto the 16th verse of Canto I.
I have now to add the following information about LP and his
works as gathered by me during the course of my studies :-
(1) Mr. Sarma is correct in assigning LP to the period c. A. D.
1650–1700.
(2) There is a MS of the Advaitasudhā of LP in the Govt. MSS
Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. It is No. 143 of 1902-1907. In
this MS we find the exact date 1 of composition of this Advaita work, viz.
Samvat 1719 = A. D. 1663.
(3) LP was a contemporary of Nīlakantha Caturdhara the celebra-
ted commentator of the Mahābhārata, who flourished at Benares between
A. D. 1650 and 1700 as I have proved in several papers.
(4) The Catalogue of Alwar Darbar MSS by Peterson (1891), p. 19 des-
cribes a work called agaikat which is possibly identical with the egga-
qu( B. O. R. I. MS) and the Altfaağayar ( Bikaner MS ). Peterson
makes the following remarks about this Alwar MS:-
" 484 -- अद्वैतसुधाकल्प by लक्ष्मण, son of दत्तसूरि of the कौण्डिन्यकुल
and गोजा of the आत्रेयकुल of Benares. गणेश and रघुनाथ
were his elder brothers and ATT and AITIT, his
uncles on the mother's side. He praises his teacher
JTA* and TATA. 's father was falsatt. Our
1 The colophon of the M8 records this date :-
" नन्देन्दुस्वरधरणी गणेपसंवत्संपन्ति गतवति विक्रमे क्रमेण । एक
हा शुक्लषोषितगिरिना तिथौ सुसिद्धा वाग्देवीकृतिविवृतिर्मम प्रसिद्धा ॥"
The chronogram 97 (9), F=(1), fai (7), puit (1) is equal to Samvat 1719 = A. D.
1663. I have described this MS on pp. 260--261 of my Cata. of Kāvya MSS (B. O. R. Institute ),
Vol. XIII, Part II ( 1942 ).

author was a hearer of yftiga's lectures and he
learned a from Alua and àe from his father.”
(5) S. R. Bhandarkar's Report on MSS ( 2nd Tour-1904–1906)
p. 45, describes a MS of the stage as follows:- “ Advaitasudhā, com-
mentary on the सारस्वतोपनिषद् which is also called रघुवंश. It is by लक्ष्मणपंडित
son of .... (a)aft, an ornament of the game family. The author was
kindly regarded by Jagtatai gyf. An attempt is made therein to
interpret the Tgazt so as to yield a Vedāntic meaning."
(6) The India Office Library contains two MSS of the (Vaidyaka)
Yoga--Candrikä [vide p. 982 of I. O. Cata., Part I by Eggeling (1896) ].
These are:-
No. 2753- staff a treatise on materia medica in 38 chapters
by लक्ष्मणपंडित, son of दत्त. The author studied medicine
at Benares under the tuition of two brothers arīta
(नागनाथ) and नारायण and had three elder brothers गणेश,
रघुनाथ and राम and a younger brother विठ्ठल. 1 This MS is
dated Samvat 1800 ( = A. D. 1744).
No. 2754-- Do--Copied by one grater in Samvat 1733 ( = A. D. 1676).
This MS is the earliest dated MS of Vaidyakacandrikā
of LP. It is 14 years earlier than the Bikaner MS of the
work copied in A. D. 1690 as pointed out by Mr. Sarma.
(7) LP States in verse 10 at the end of the Advaitasudhā as
follows:--
"स लक्ष्मणो दक्षिणदिश्यपास्य श्रियः सदानन्दममन्दमिच्छन् ।
काश्यामुदासीनमतिः शरीरे विश्वेशसेवी समयाकरोति ॥ १० ॥"
Evidently LP was a southerner. He abandoned his property at home
and becoming indifferent to the world went to Benares. LP was possibly
a Mahārāstra Brahmin as the name of his mother, viz. tot suggests. We
must, however, get more data for proving this point conclusively.
(8) Works and authors mentioned by LP in his Advaitasudha (B.
O. R. I. MS No. 103 of 1902-1907) are:--
विश्व, अमर, याज्ञवल्क्यवचनव्याख्या, कामधेनौ, सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरणव्याख्याता, अमर-
चन्द्र, विवरणाचार्यचरणाः, मालविकाग्निमित्रे, मेदिनी, काव्यप्रकाश, चित्रमीमांसा, कैयटे, वेद-

Eggeling.

The foregoing list of works and authors mentionod by LP has been
made by me cursorily, but it is sufficient to prove the wide range of study
carried on by LP at Benares. In fact LP shows familiarity with practi-
cally all branches of Sanskrit learning. We must, therefore, investigate
and see if he composed any other works besides the अद्वैतसुधा, योगचन्द्रिका
and सारचन्द्रिका referred to above.

(9) The genealogy of LP may be represented as follows:--
la 4719 ( of aaufà family of jogsz ta)
दत्त
( married गोजा of आत्रेय गोत्र. Her brothers: -- नागेश and नारायण )
गणेश रघुनाथ राम लक्ष्मण विठ्ठल
(A. D. 1663)
(10) The chronology of the works of LP and their extant MSS as
discussed in the present paper is as follows:--
A. D. 1560-1620 -- Bhattoji Dīkşita flourished at Benares.
LP mentions Bhattoji's शब्दकौस्तुभ in अद्वैतसुधा.
, 1550-1600 -- Appaya Dikṣita flourished at Benares.
LP mentions aastatat and other works af Appaya
Dīkşita in gaga.
1663 -- LP composed his engager at Benares.
1676 -- India Office MS of the art of LP.
1690 — Bikaner MS of the traft of LP.
., 1743 -- India Office MS of the trail of LP.
1856 --B. O. R. Institute MS of the sgagur of LP.
(11) Aufrecht (CC I, 536 ) refers to one namesake of LP in the
following entry :-
"लक्ष्मणभट्ट perhaps the guru of नीलकण्ठ ( भारतभावदीपिका) (composed )
AETH!Taktai".
Cf. CC, I, 439 -- "AETHITat#1 by GEATH (Burnell 148a )". MS men.
tioned by Aufrecht as “ Burnell 184a " is identical with MS No. 8660 of
Tanjore Des. Catalogue, Vol. XV, p. 6185.
This is a MS of farizyatalat of FEATHE and it is dated Śaka 1589 =
A. D. 1667.
I find it difficult to accept Aufrecht's suggested identity of this ge-
भट्ट with लक्ष्मणार्य 1 mentioned by नीलकंठ चतुर्धर as his guru in Vedanta in
the following verses :-
1 Vide Mimāmsā Prakāka, Poona, April 1938, page 69-my article on Nārāyaṇatirtha, the
guru of Nilakantha Caturdhara in Mimāmsāja

The Advaitasudbā of Laksmana Pandita
"वेदान्ते लक्ष्मणार्य ऋतुविधिविवृतौ तीर्थनारायणार्य ad i os

o st
वेदे साङ्गे पितृव्यं शिवमथ पितरं दक्षिणामूर्युपास्तौ

_I am, however, inclined to suggest that लक्ष्मणार्य mentioned by नीलकण्ठ
as his guru in Vedānta in the above stanza is possibly identical with
लक्ष्मणपंडित, the author of the अद्वैतसुधा, who was a senior contemporary of
नीलकण्ठ चतुर्धर at Benares, say between A. D. 1630 and 1675. We have seen
already that लक्ष्मणपंडित constantly refers to his guru उत्तमश्लोकतीर्थ in his
अद्वैतसुधा. नीलकण्ठ चतुर्धर also refers to (1) his Vedanta teacher लक्ष्मणार्य and
(2) उत्तमश्लोकतीर्थ in the following stanzas of his रुद्रसारसंग्रहव्याख्याः-
" गोपालं भूम्नि वेदे शिवमथविनये दक्षिणामूर्त्यपास्तौ
वेदान्ते लक्षणार्य ऋतुविधिविवृतौ तीर्थनारायणार्यम् ।
तके धीरेशमिश्रान् फणिपतिभणितौ पोलगङ्गाधरायम्

उत्तमश्लोकतीर्थाब्धिलब्धसद्युक्तमौक्तिकैः ।
खचिता रुद्रसूक्तस्य द्योततां धीमतां हृदि ॥"1
I may also point out that लक्ष्मणभट्ट, the author of विराटपर्वप्रकाश ( MS of
A. D. 1667) styles himself as "SÍTHEHETEA 7 Tifosat JEAT etc.” He is there-
fore, different from लक्ष्मणपंडित, the son of गोजा and दत्त and the author of
the अद्वैतसुधा.
I hope the information about LP, the author of the Advaitasudhā,
recorded by me in this paper will enable other scholars to study his
works more closely than they have done hitherto. In particular I would
invite definite evidence from such scholars on the following points :--
(1) My suggested identity of LP with लक्ष्मणार्य mentioned by Nila-
kantha Caturdhara as his guru in Vedānta.
(2) Any more information about LP than what is recorded by me
above, especially about his descendants and the Brahmajñāni family of
Kaundinya Gotra to which he belonged.
(3) Exact dates of composition of the works of LP other than the
Advaitasudhā composed in A. D. 1663.
(4) Was LP a Maharastra Brahmin ? If so, can we get any infor-
mation about his migration to Benares from the Maratha sources ? LP

definitely states that he abandoned his property in the South and went to
Benares ( feferat fra: 379177 FIFTI9gi4taafa: arti etc.)
(5) Can we get any more historical information about the contact
of LP with his gurus उत्तमश्लोकतीर्थ and रामाश्रम, 1 mentioned as मुनिद्वय in the ..
अद्वैतसुधा?

8. Fragments of Poems pertaining to King
Sambhu, Son of Shivaji *
More than two years ago Mr. K. N. Deshapande, B. A., LL. B., pleader,
Kolhapur, discovered two fragments of Manuscripts, one Sanskrit and
the other Marathi, in the records of the Rajopadhye family of Kolhapur
and he was kind enough to prepare copies of them and forward them to
Mr. G. S. Sardesai, B. A., Editor, Peshwa Daftar. In the meanwhile I
published in the Annals Vol. XVI, pp. 262–291 my paper on Hari Kavi,
the Court-poet of King Sambhaji and his Works. As some of the frag.
ments of the Mss copied by Mr. Deshapande contained new material about
the reign of the same Maratha King Sambhaji and appeared to form
portion of some unknown complete poems, Mr. Sardesai desired that
I should publish these fragments with their critical analysis. I gratefully
agreed to this suggestion and wanted to avail myself of the originals of
the copies prepared by Mr. Deshapande. As, however, I failed to secure
the originals, I have thought it advisable to publish the copies as they
have reached me, with a view to facilitating my critical analysis of these
fragments and at the same time guarding against permanent loss of this
important material. I wish to draw the attention of research students to
these fragments to enable them to trace the whole works of which these
are portions. My critical analysis of these pieces will have to wait till
their publication in suitable instalments. With these remarks I present to
the readers the following first instalment of the Sanskrit fragment in
question.

9. Fragments of poems pertaining to king
Sambhu, son of Shivaji *
I published in the Annals of the B. O. R. Institute, Vol. XVIII,
pp. 287–295 the first instalment of the fragments of poems pertaining
to the Maratha King Sambhaji, son of Shivaji the great. The following
fragments form the second instalment of these poems found in the records
of the Rajopadhye family of Kolhapur. The circumstances under which
copies of these fragments were kept at my disposal by Rao Bahadur
G. S. Sardesai, Editor, Peshwa Daftar, and Mr. K. N. Deshpande of Kolhapur
have already been described by me in my introductory note to the first
instalment of these fragments.

contains a MS called qT49#TOT ( folios 16). In the Govt. MSS Library
there is another MS of 9279570 No. 567 of 1883–84 acquired by Sir R. G.
Bhandarkar from the Maratha country.
2 Vide article on sy in the Fertight Man (by S. V. Ketkar ), Vol.
XVII, ( 1925) 9 - 242–248. The total population of this Kāyastha Prabhu
caste in the whole of India may come to about 30,000. The Mahārāstra
historian Rajwade ( Khanda VI) records in all 9 grāmaṇyas about the
Prabhu caste. Dates of some of these disputes:-Saka 1391 (A. D. 1469) ;
Saka 1591 ( A. D. 1669); Saka 1597 ( A. D. 1675 ); Saka 1669 (A. D. 1747);
Saka 1714 (A. D. 1792 ); Saka 1745 ( A. D. 1823 ).
3 The adopted son of Nīlakantha Sūri Thatte was married to the
daughter ( Tai) of Sardār Bālāji Nārāyaṇa Nātū in A. D. 1818. (Vide p.
123 of Thatte Kula-vittānta, Poona, 1936.) This Sardar Bālājipant Nātū
was associated with the Kāyastha Prabhu dispute of Saka 1745 (=A.
D. 1823 ). It is possible to suppose that Nīlakantha Sūri composed his
For FT-77HSAICSI in connection with the dispute of 1823 A. D. to vindicate
his relative's (Bālājipant's ) position against the Kāyastha Prabhus. If
this inference is correct the date of #F7F9qT49Acai must lie between A. D.
1823 and A. D. 1827, the date of the MS of this work.

which he records only one Ms viz., “Khn 76." Prof. P. V. Kane also
mentions the work "TT7Tarot by Nīlakantha Sūri” in his History of
Dharmaśāstra 1 along with other works regarding the Parabhu caste and
the Kāyasthas 2. I am not aware if Aufrecht or Prof. Kane had examined
an actual MS of Nīlakantha Sūri's work, which they have designated
"TT77*TOT.” Recently I came across a MS 3 of Nīlakantha Sūri's work
called " #TTEYTTYPACE.” I have no doubt that this work is identical
with the quaTur of Nīlakantha Sūri mentioned by Aufrecht and Kane.

with a view to studying and recording some historical information gathered

The author of the कायस्थपरभूधर्मादर्श is identical with नीलकण्ठ विनायक थथे or थत्ते
mentioned in some of the above mentioned documents. His descendants
are still living in Poona ( Vide pp. 52-53). A brief genealogy of
Nīlakantha Sūri may be recorded here :-
केशव-गोपाळ-विश्वनाथ--नारायण--विनायक--नीलकण्ठशास्त्री
(A.D. 1775 (A.D. (Died 1834 A. D.)
....1783) 1772)
In Document No. 9 dated 20th October 1775 our author's grand-
father is referred to as follows :
"वे. रा. नारायणभट बिन विस्वनाथभट ईबिन गोपाळभट उपनाम थथे गोत्र शाण्डिल्य सूत्र
अस्वलायेन जोतिषी व उपाध्ये मौजे बिवली ता हवेली हमजाबाद ता अजनवेला हाली वास्तव्य कसबे
पुणे".
_ Our author's father विनायकभट was a फडणीस of शिरेपरगणा in the
Karnātak ( Document No. 10 dated A, D. 1777 ). He is mentioned in
Document No. 30 of A. D. 1816. The marriage of our author's adopted son
is referred to in Document No 31 of A. D. 1818 (from Bālāji Nārāyaṇa
Nātū to Mount Stuart Elphinstone). Document No. 32 dated 17th January
1880 records the grant (of village कोलघर to our author " नीलकण्ठशास्त्री विनायक-
भट थथे") from Raghoji Angre. Document No. 33 dated 7th January 1831
records a grant of land to our author. Document No 34 dated 26th July
1838 records a grant of land to our author's son नारायणशास्त्री नीलकण्ठशास्त्री थथे.
This नारायणशास्त्री was the eldest son of नीलकण्ठ's cousin मोरशास्त्री. नारायण was
adopted as son in A. D. 1815 by नीलकण्ठ as he had no issue (p. 123 of
Thatte History).

Gagabhatta composed in Saka 1603 (A. D. 1681 ) a work called समयनय on
dharma for Shivaji's son Sambhāji and a MS of this work is at Florence
(Italy). He officiated at the coronation of Shivaji in A. D. 1674. MS No.
9670 in Baroda Ori. Institute shows that Gāgābhatta composed his
कायस्थधर्मप्रदीप in Saka 1899 = A. D. 1677 (Vide Kane : His. of Dh. I. p. 742 ).
The Marathi Bakhar शिवदिग्विजय (Baroda, 1895) describes गागाभट्ट as महा-
समर्थब्राह्मण, तेजोराशी, तपोराशी, अपरसूर्य, साक्षात् वेदो नारायण, महाविद्वान् (p. 410). Vide p.
311 of मध्ययुगीन चरित्रकोश (1937).
2 According to Sahyādri Khanda of the Skandapurāņa the
Candrasenīya Kāyasthas originated from a Kşatriya king cha, who was
killed by Paraśurāma. The widow of aùa who was pregnant at the death
of her husband went to the hermitage of grepp sage. Paraśurāma agreed
not to molest her on condition that this would-be son of arch should not
behave as a Kşatriya. The sage agreed to this condition and the son born
of the widow of a tha was brought up by the sage and be pursued the
profession of a scribe. The descendants of this son of alla came to be
called Cāndrasenīya Kāyasthas.
3 खण्डो बल्लाळ चिटणीस who accompanied Rajarama Chatrapati to Jinji
in A. D. 1690 was a चैत्रगुप्तकायस्थ. Kesava Pandita refers to him as follows in
verse 22 of Sarga IV of his राजारामचरितः-
" खण्डोबल्लाळमुख्याश्च कायस्थाश्चित्रगुप्तजाः ।

for about 19 years till his death in A. D. 1834. Presuming that he was
about 35 years at the time of his adopting a son we get A. D. 1780 as the
probable date of his birth, the entire period of his life being about 54
years, if not more. It would, therefore, be reasonable to fix the literary
activity of नीलकण्ठ to a period between A. D. 1800 and A. D. 1834. We
have the copy of his कायस्थपरभूधर्मादर्श dated A. D. 1827 and consequently
the date of composition of this work must be between A. D. 1800 and 1827.

Nilakantha ( = N ) was a well-known Pandit of his time. He received
his early education at Poona. Rāma Šāstri Prabhuậe ( died A. D. 1789 )
sent him to Benares for further education at the expense of the Peshwa.
At Benares he studied under बाळभट्ट पायगुण्डे, the pupil of रामचन्द्रभट्ट तारे, who
was himself the pupil of the celebrated apaa11 HE Fords, the author of the
परिभाषेन्दुशेखर. After becoming proficient in grammar and other subjects N
returned to Poona. He had many illustrious disciples, some of whom are:-
__(1) मोरशास्त्री साठे (नैयायिक), (2) कुप्पाशास्त्री द्रविड ( नैयायिक ), (3) त्र्यम्बकशास्त्री
शालिग्राम (मीमांसक), (4) विनायकशास्त्री दिवेकर, (5) भास्करशास्त्री अभ्यङ्कर (वैयाकरण),
(6) राघवेन्द्राचार्य गजेन्द्रगडकर (वैयाकरण ) and गोविन्दाचार्य अष्टपुत्रे. मेरुशास्त्री गोडबोले though
not a direct pupil of alsogtrait stayed with N and taught many pupils. N
was appointed by Bālājipant Natu as an assistant to the Nyāyādhisa in the
Adalat Court at Satara on Rs 100. He left this service later but used to
receive some stipend monthly from Government. 01

Another quotation of 23 verses occurs on folios 68-69.
2 Ed. N. S. Press, Bombay, 1895. The Sadrakamalakara by
Kamalakarabhatta is a standard treatise on the duties of Sūdras. In the
Śūdrakamalākara the author refers to his Nirnayasindhu composed in
A. D. 1612 (20th February). Gagabhatta (1674 A. D.) was the nephew of
Kamalakarabhatta (Vide p. 437 of Kane's History of Dharma. Vol. I, 1930).
3 Possibly identical with a work of this name by कृष्णशेष, son of
नृसिंहशेष composed by order of पिलाजीनृप son of केशवदास, B. O. R. I. MS No.
50 of 1872–73 of this work was copied at Cam bay on 4th March, 1591. It
is mentioned in आचाररत्न of लक्ष्मण (Between 1520-1590 A. D.). Vide p. 641
of Kane : History of Dharma., I).
4 Sakhopant Ananta Limaye (A. D. 1800 to about A. D. 1840) was
a contemporary of our author Nīlakantha Vināyaka Thatthe (died A. D.
1834). The MS of the कायस्थपरभूधर्मादर्श belonging to Sakhopant is dated A. D.
1827. In a letter in Modi script (Limaye Family Papers No. 3 with me)
dated A. D. 1827 our author is referred to as " वेदशास्त्रसंपन्ननीलकण्ठशास्त्री थथे".
Sakhopant had a passion for collecting and preserving many Sanskrit
MSS as is evident from the number of about 450 MSS preserved and

The foregoing introductory verses clearly indicate (1) the correct
title of the work (which is " कायस्थपरभूधर्मादर्श" and not परभूप्रकरण) as also
(2) the name and surname of our author (viz. नीलकण्ठ विनायक थत्थे). The guru
Suit (Continued from the previous page)
added to by his descendants. Many of these MSS were got copied by
Sakhopant between A. D. 1800 and 1840. Sakhopant being a lover of
Sanskrit learning must have been in close contact with our author Nīla-
kaņtha Vināyaka Thatthe:-
According to Thatte Family History, Nīlakantha S'āstri was sent to
Benares for education by the celebrated nyāyādhisa of the Peshwa period,
Ramasastri Prabhune, who died in 1789 A. D. We have elsewhere stated
A. D. 1780 or so as the probable date of Nilakantha's birth. If the above
statement in the Thatte History is correct we may have to push back this
probable birth-date of Nilakantha, say up to A. D. 1775 or so to enable us
to presume that he was about 14 years of age at the time of Rāma Sāstri's
death in A. D. 1789. Rama Sastri 'held the office of Nyayādhisa for the
last time for 12 years between A. D. 1777 and 1789 at the request of Nana
Fadnis. It is possible to suppose that Nīlakaạtha may have been sent to
Benares at Peshwa's expense between A. D. 1785 and 1789.

of our author mentioned in verse 2 above is 57793 1 who remains to be

A. D. 1823, with which Sardar Bālājipant Nātu 1 was closely associated. It
would be reasonable to presume that Bālājipant should find in his relative
Nīlakantha Sāstri 2 a protagonist of the position taken by him against the
Prabhus 3. If this presumption is correct the date of the present work
would lie between A. D. 1823 and 1827, the year in which two MSS of the
work were got copied by the members of the Limaye family.

On p. 25 we have a reference to the request made by Bālājipant to Pratap
Singh, the Raja of Satara (17th July 1819) that the Raja should show to
Grant Duff all papers to help him to write an authentic history of the
Marathas.
2 Ibid., p. 22-Pratapa Singh records in his Diary under date 25th
July, 1819, some conversation between one atsaudiret and Grant Duff on
Hindu Customs (“ atspogrirait a la più alsù raia fece arata”). I am
inclined to identify this नीलकण्ठशास्त्री with the author of the कायस्थपरभूधर्मादर्श,
as we know from the Thatte Family History that our author was given
as an assistant to the judge at the Adălat Court at Satara by Bālājipant
Nātu. On pp. 40-41 we have a proclamation about the Vishrambag Palace
Pātha-Sālā dated 21st Sept. 1819, providing for instruction in 29719701
and other Šāstras. I wonder if our author, who was proficient in
grammar had anything to do with this Pāțha-Sālā. This point is worth
investigating

11. Upanisadbrahmayogin and Hathayogapradipika *
The Muktīkopanişad 1 appears to be the only Upanişad, which
enumerates the 108 Upanişads. This number includes 20 Upanişads, 2
which treat of yoga and a study of which is essential for all students of
the history of the yogaśāstra. The only commentary by a single author
on the 108 Upanişads is that of Upanişadbrahmayogin, published for the
first time by the Adyar Library. This commentator closely follows the
commentary of Sankarācārya for such of these Upanişads as are com.
mented on by the great Advaitin. His advaitic bias is further illustrated
by the following explanation of the term हठ (in the expression हठयोग)
in commenting on the 45th verse 3 of the Yogatattvopanişad, which descri-
bes a Yogī, who has attained siddhi or perfection, as follows :-
" नासौ मरणमाप्नोति पुनर्योगबलेन तु ।
हठेन मृत एवासौ मृतस्य मरणं कुतः ॥ ४५ ॥"
The commentator explains this verse as under :--
Rate " मरणादेः देहनिष्ठत्वेन योगिनो देहातीतत्वात् , " न जायते म्रियते वा विपश्चित्" इति
श्रुतेः । ब्रह्मातिरेकेण देहादिकं नास्तीति बोध एव हठः, हठेन सम्यग्ज्ञानेन मृत एवासौ देहः "
We wonder if this equation " हठ = सम्यग्ज्ञान " would be acceptable to the
students of Sanskrit philology as also of the Yogaśāstra. de

Our commentator quotes from a treatise on the Hathayoga and
calls it by the name zgart in the following extract from his commentary
on verse 73 of the Brahmavidyopanisad 1 :--
"यद्वा-गोशब्देन जिह्वोच्यते । तथा च हठतन्त्रे आम्नायते-“गोमांस भक्षयेत् " इत्यं-
शविवरणे " गोशब्देनेरिता जिह्वा" इत्युक्तत्वात् "
In the above extract the commentator refers to two consecutive verses
in a work on the Hathayoga (हठतन्त्रे ). We have been able to identify
these two verses in the Hathayogapradīpikā of Svātmārāma. They are
identical with verses 47 and 48 of the 3rd Chapter ( तृतीयोपदेश) of this
treatise 2 and read as follows:--
"गोमांसं भक्षयेन्नित्यं पिबेदमरवारुणीम् ।
कुलीनं तमहं मन्य इतरे कुलघातकाः ॥४७॥
गोशब्देनोदिता* जिह्वा तत्प्रवेशो हि तालुनि ।
गोमांसभक्षणं तत्तु महापातकनाशम् ॥ ४८ ॥"
__(* Upanisadbrahmayogin uses the variant ईरिता for उदिता)
The manner in which two consecutive verses from the East have
been referred to by our commentator and their exact identification in the
Hathayogapradipikā in the same order appears to indicate that the car
referred to by our commentator is identical with the Hathayogapradipikā
of Svātmārāma, a standard work on the Hathayoga. This conclusion of
ours finds further corroboration in another reference to a 'हठयोगतन्त्र'
which is found in our commentator's explanation of verse 128 of the
Yogatattvopanisad 3. This verse reads as follows:- 26
अमरी यः पिबेन्नित्यं नस्यं कर्वन दिने दिनेTOES
sarno वजोलीमभ्यसेनित्यममरोलीति कथ्यते ॥ १२४DOORupaar
This verse is identical with the following verse in the Hathayoga-
pradipika 4 (verse 97 of तृतीयोपदेश)-
rorite ori "अमरीं यः पिबेन्नित्यं नस्यं कुर्वन्दिने दिने ॥
i coinireme
वज्रोलीमभ्यसेत्सम्यक्साऽमरोलीति कथ्यते ॥ ९७ ॥"
coda
tot The only difference in the two verses quoted above is of the reading
" नित्यम्" for " सम्यक्सा " but this is negligible. This identity of the two
verses, one in the Yogatattvopanişad and the other in the Hathayoga-

Studies in Indian Literary History
pradipikā raises the question about the relative chronology of the two
works. This question, however, cannot be decided at present for want of
additional conclusive evidence on the point. As some of the Upanişads
are quite late it is difficult to say whether the Hathayogapradīpikā has
borrowed the verse under reference from the Yogatattvopanişad or vice
versa. Then again the argument of a common source for both these works
cannot be ruled out of this discussion.
What concerns us here, however, is our commentator's explanation
of the above verse and his introduction of another verse from a gara-
an'as under :-
" 2911 a putnars afaiça-
पित्तोल्बणत्वात् प्रथमां च धारां
विहाय निस्सारतयाऽन्त्यधाराम् ।
निषेव्यते शीतळमध्यधारा
aglfaastattfafest Il gfa 1 11 ”or d
This verse as quoted by our commentator is identical with verse 96 of
the gatalogat of the Hathayogapradipikā 2 and reads as follows:-
__“ पित्तोल्बणत्वात्प्रथमाम्बुधारां ।
ferat franad
निषेव्यते शीतलमध्यधारा
5197 EighSanta 11.88 11"
The first three lines of the above verse contain slight variations in
readings but the fourth line is quite different from the fourth line of the
verse quoted by our commentator. It is likely that our commentator
might have had a different text of this verse before him or he had quoted
from memory. In spite of these variants the identity of the two verses in
point of major particulars and purport cannot be rejected and proves in
our opinion that the GTA-T mentioned by our commentator is no other
than the ginger of Svātmārāma.
The use of the words guars and guitar made by our commentator
and his introduction of 3 verses which we have identified in the Hatha-
yogapradīpikā leads us to conclude that Upanişadbrahmayogin, the com-
mentator of the yoga Upanişads is quoting from the Hathayogapradīpikā.
The date of his commentary on the 108 Upanişads is, therefore, posterior

to that of the Hathayogapradipikā. 1 I have tried to fix the limits of the
date of the Hathayogapradipikā in an article 2 contributed to the Indian
Historical Quarterly, (Calcutta ), Vol. XVI, (1940 ), pp. 306-313. These
limits are tentatively ABOUT 1250 AND 1550 A.D. and harmonize with the
following remarks of Dr. J. N. Farquhar 3 on the Hathayogapradipikā :-
“On the Hathayoga and the Goraksa-Sataka which are mentioned
above as works attributed to Gorakhnāth three more modern works
depend, the Hathayogapratīpikā, by Svātmārāma Yogīndra, the disciple
of Srīnātha, the Gheranda Samhitā and the Siva- Samhitā. The first is the
earliest of the three". As Dr. Farquhar assigns Gorakhnāth 4 to "about
A.D. 1200" and as the Hathayogapradipikā5 is the earliest of the three
works based on the works attributed to Gorakhnāth our limits for the
date of this work viz 1250 and 1550 A.D. appear to be tentatively correct.
Consequently the date of Upanışadbrahmayogin, who apparently quotes
from the Hathayogapradipikā as suggested in this paper, will have to be
shifted to a period later than 1350 6 A.D.
1. J. N. Farquhar : Outlines of Religious History of India, pp. 348 and 384.
2. Date of the Hathayogapradipikā of Svātmārāma Muni.
3. Farquhar: Outlines.etc., p. 348.
4. Ibid., p. 254.
gear 5. Vide, pp. 9 to 19 of Hall's Bibliography of Indian Philosophical Systems, Calcutta,
1859. Hall gives a description of 36 works on Yoga philosophy. On page 16 he
gives a list of Yoga teachers as found in Eathayogapradīpikā.
6. Upani şadbrahmayogin in his commentary on the Vaisnava Upanişads (p. 49 of
Adyar Edı. 1923) quotes from a work called analfaol as follows :-
["q afrag” şfà fa&ifql?: ). Aufrecht records two works of the title
Saetaal, one a work on Tantra and another dealing with Krona worship (See Cata.
al Catalogorum I, p. 132 ) by Keſavācārya also called Keśava Kashmiri, a well-
known scholar and commentator, who is assigned to early 16th century (See pp. 376
and 305 of Farquhar : Outlines etc.) If the reference to alfaar by Upani şad-
brahmayogin proves on identification to be the work of Keśava Kashmiri
(C. 1525 A.D.) the date of Upanişadbrahmayogin will be shifted to a period
commencing 1550 A.D. or so. As the quotation under reference is introduced in
the commentary on the Vaisnava Upanişads there is greater ossibility of its being
treated in Kesava's work on Krona-worship than in a tantric work. For want of
definite identification of the reference in question we are unable to deduce any
positive conclusion in the matter at present.

Between A.D. 1657 and 1685
sig i Aufrecht records the following works of Damodara Daivajña in his
Catalogus Catalogorum, Part I, p. 151:-

Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in his Report for 1882–83 (Bombay, 1884),
p. 30, describes a MS of Jātakapaddhati of Keśava of Nandigrāma and
states that this Keśava wrote a commentary on this work. In this
commentary he quotes दामोदर.
According to S. B. Dikșita (History of Indian Astronomy, Poona,
1896, p. 258) Keśava II (Father of Gaņeśa Daivajña) lived about Saka
1418 ( = A. D. 1496). This Keśava of A. D. 1496 is the author of the
F1789&fa, which is mentioned in a work called Muhūrtamārtanda com.
posed in Saka 1493 (= A.D. 1571). It appears from these facts that EAGT
mentioned by Keśava is earlier than A.D. 1500.
este
Dāmodara Daivajña, the author of the Sabhāvinoda is quite different
from his namesake, quoted by Keśava in his Jātakapaddhati as I propose
to show in this paper.
The only MS of the Sabhāvinoda recorded by Aufrecht in his
Catalogus Catalogorum, Part 1, is the following:-
Page 696 — "ahaalz on proper conduct in public assemblies by
Daivajña Damodara, Oudh X, 26."
- The "Oudh" MS mentioned by Aufrecht is not accessible to me.
My friend Mr. B. L. Partudkar of Phulkalas (P. 0. Purna, N.S.R.) paid
a visit to the B. O. R. Institute and handed over to me a MS of
Sabhāvinoda of Daivajña Dāmodara. This work appears to be identical
with that mentioned by Aufrecht in the above entry.
I give below a critical analysis of this MS as the MS is rare and
unknown to Sanskrit scholars. It begins as follows:--

From the extracts quoted above we get the following information
about the author and his patron, for whom apparently the work Sabhāvi-
noda was composed:-
(1) The author bows to god Dhundirāja and goddess Bhārati ( versės
1 and 2).
(2) King Mahendramalla of Nepal was born in Suryavamsa. His
mudrā (seal) was known as “ Mahendramallī” (verses 3 and 4).
See (3) In his line was born Sivasimha ( verses 5, 6).
(4) Description of Nepal and its temples of gods and goddesses viz.
Ganesa, Durgā, Vişņu, Kāli, Bhima, Matsyendranātha, Guhye-
svari, Pasupati, Tulajā, Garuda, Nilakantha, etc. ( verses 7-14).
De (5) The author thinks that the gods of different places have gathered
tanti in Nepal and made it their home as it were out of fear of
20 Emperor Aurangzeb (verse 15).
ods beso s
(6) In Nepal there is a town called “Lalitapattana". Its King was
Sivasimha. His son was Hariharasimha. His son was Siddhanr.
simha ( verses 16-20).

As the Ms of the Sabhāvinoda before us is dated A.D. 1837, we have
to search for the chronology of its author and his royal patron Srinivāsa.
malla ruling at Lalitapattana in Nepal before A.D. 1800 or so. The refe-
rence to “ Aurangaśāha " or Aurangzeb by our author in verse 15 gives
us the earlier limit to his date. Emperor Aurangzeb came to the throne
in A.D. 1659 and died in A.D. 1707. We may, therefore, fix A.D. 1659 as
the earlier limit to the date of the Sabhāvinoda and its author Daivajña
Damodara.
Some of the Inscriptions from Nepal published by Bhagavanlal
Indraji in Vol. IX of Indian Antiquary ( 1880 ) help us to identify King
Srinivāsamalla, the patron of Daivajña Dāmodara. I note below the pertinent
inscriptions and the data furnished by them pertaining to the Kings of
Nepal mentioned in the Sabhāvinoda :-

I am concerned in this paper with the dates for Srinivāsamalla,
the patron of Daivajña Dāmodara, and his father Siddhinysimha as also
his son Yoga Narendra Malla. I, therefore, put together below the dates
for these rulers given in their coins and inscriptions :--

The regnal period of Śrīnīvāsa Malla must lie between A.D. 1654,
the last date for his father and A. D. 1685, the first date for his son in the
above list of dates. Consequently the date of the Sabhāvinoda which was
composed for Srīnivāsamalla, while he was ruling, must lie between A.D.
1654 and 1685.
as In the article on "Some considerations on the History of Nepal " by

According to the above information King Siddhinysimha became an
ascetic in A.D. 1657 and his son Srinivāsamalla ruled from A.D. 1657. In
view of this date the regnal period of Srinivāsamalla lies between A.D.
1657 and A.D. 1685, the first date of the coin of Yoganarendramalla. It
is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the Sabhāvinoda was composed
for Śrīnivāsamalla between A.D. 1657 and A.D. 1685.1
The rare MS of the Sabhāvinoda analysed in this paper is dated ſaka
1759 ( = A.D. 1837 ). At the end of the MS there is a contemporary en.
dorsement that it belonged to " Rāmacandrabhat Purānika Sāngavikar. ”
My friend Shri B. L. Partud kar procured this MS from the present descen-
dants of Rāmacandrabhat now living at Partu ( Dist. Parabhani ) in
Hyderabad territory. The genealogy of this family as supplied to me by Shri
Partudkar is given in the Appendix.
The Purāạik family of Partuď originally belongs to the village Jod.
Sāngavi on the banks of the river Pūrņā. Rāmacandra Purāṇik of this
family was the first to migrate to Partud and settle there. Both Rāmacan-
dra and his son Pāņduranga became Sanyāsins at the close of their
lives and assumed the names Rāmānanda and Isvarānanda respectively.
They died at Partuď, where their Samādhis or tombs exist at present
together with their busts made of brass. Rāmacandra Purāṇik was
possibly a contemporary of Raja Candūlal, the then minister of the Nizam
State. Shri Nagūdeva, the present descendant of this family has in his
possession a complete MS of the Mahābhārata copied in the life-time of
Rāmacandra Purāņik. This family has been enjoying the privilege of
working as Purāņiks in the NỊsimha temple at Partuď in a hereditary
manner. The family was also the owner of about 150 acres of land given as
inām to it for its service as Purāņiks in the Nșsimha temple together with
a cash annual allowance of Rs. 150/-from Government. The family enjoyed
these privileges up to the time of Bālābhau, the father of Shri Nāgūdeva.
At present the land referred to above is with the above family but Govern.
ment charges land revenue for it. Mr. B. L. Partudkar had an occasion to
examine about 75 bundles of records of this family besides about 300
MSS in its possession. These MSS were copied between Saka 1602
( = A. D. 1680 ) and Saka 1802 (= A. D. 1880 ) a period of 200 years.
In some of these MSS the village Partud is mentioned as “ Praharāda-
1 The latest inscription of 1701 A.D. mentioned by Bhagvanlal Indraji for śrinivāsamalla
needs to be reconciled with the coin of Yoganarendra dated A.D. 1685. Perhaps Śrīnivāsamalla
abandoned the kingdom in favour of Yoganarendramalla sometime before A.D. 1685 and
continued to live as far as A.D. 1701, the date of his inscription mentioned by Bhagavanlal
Indraji.

pur." Ramacandra Puranik calls himself " Sangavikar ". He composed
a Marathi prose commentary on Satpañcāśkā, a copy of which is in the
possession of Shri B. L. Partudkar. The genealogy given above is per-
pared on the basis of records in the possession of the Purāṇik family.
I am thankful to Shri B. L. Partudkar and to Shri Nāgūdeva
Purāṇik for keeping at my disposal the MS of the Sabhāvinoda and for
supplying information about the Purāņik family of Partud.

13. Harikavi alias Bhanubhatta, a Court-Poet
Of King Sambhaji And His Works : *
(1) Sambhurājacarita composed in A. D. 1685; ( 2 ) Haiha-
yendracarita and its commentary;( 3 ) Subhāsitahārāvali.
The only Ms of Sambhurāja-carita by Harikavi recorded by Aufre-
cht 1 is “ Report XIII” which is the same as No. 191 of 1875-76 in the
Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. This Ms is fragmen-
tary and incomplete but is historically very important as it is a poem of
very high order dealing with the life of the Maratha King Sambhāji,
the son of Shivāji, the founder of the Maratha Kingdom in the Deccan.
This Ms was acquired by Dr. Buhler in 1875 2 from Surat. Unlike
Rājārāma-carita 3 of Keśavapandita which bristles with the names of
historical personages and events, the Sambhurāja-carita, judging from the
fragment before us, is unfortunately lacking in historical details to such
an extent that even the identity of Sambhurāja, the hero of the poem has
got to be proved. In fact my friend Mr. V. S. Bendre, who first studied
this Ms in 1931 and whose zest for historical knowledge about King
Sambhāji has led him to the establishment of an institution called Sambhāji
Caritra Kāryālaya with the sole purpose of gathering materials for a
historical biography of King Sambhāji, was disappointed in a further
study of this fragment and consequently the fragment remains unnoticed
since its acquisition in 1875 by Dr. Buhler.
I shall now proceed to show that King Sambhurāja, the hero of the
poem, is none other than the renowned Sambhāji, son and successor of
Shivāji the Great. This is clear from the following extracts culled at
random from the fragment before us :- 970
Shivāji is referred to in the following extracts :-
folio 3—“Teretaneti prataThai fayaai
शिवाख्यो देशानामधिपतिरनेकाद्भुतगुणः। ।

-“वदान्यो नेहान्यो जगति शिवभूपाद्विजयते" ॥ २५॥roie
The parentage of Sambhāji from Shivāji is clear from the
following: -

folio 4-"प्रदीपो दीपांगादिव गगनरत्नादिव महा-
donlod

folio 79 -" रणांगणविसर्पिणः शिवभवस्य भूपशितुः etc." pausrail
folio 80-"शिवोद्भवनृपोद्तौ"
We get a glimpse of Sambhāji's youthful person in the following
verse:-
folio 44 - "अस्मिन्काले कमलनयनः कोटिकंदर्पकांतो।
नानाकल्पद्युतिपृथुवपुर्मत्तमातंगगामी॥
शंभुर्डीलासचिवसहितो मंदहासोल्लसछ्रीः ।
शंगाराख्यो रस इव चरन्राजमार्ग विवेश ॥"
He is referred to as शंभु, शंभुनपति and शंभुराज throughout the Ms.
The poem consisted of 12 sargas or cantos and it is really a great
loss to literature that only about 2-3 cantos are available to us in
the present fragment. Mr. Bendre has not been successful in his attempts
to get a complete copy of the work. The fourth canto deals with the
poetic description of Sambhāji's marriage in quite a classical style and
is concluded with the following colophon:-
_folio 53- " इति श्रीमत्सूर्यपुरस्थितश्रीनारायणसूरिसूनुहरिकविविरचिते
विजयांके श्रीशंभुराजचरिताख्ये महाकाव्ये श्रीशंभुराजविवाहवर्णनो नाम
- चतुर्थः सर्गः समाप्तः ॥"
In the 4th canto Sambhurāja's bride is referred to as sign in the
following verses:-
folio 49-चंपानाम्नी रतिमिव जगन्मोहिनी स्वां कुमारी।
ततानैषीदतिविलुलितः सूर्यजासेवकोपि ॥ ९८ ॥"

The following verse mentions the bestowal of tiqi in marriage to
शंभु by her father " तपनजादास" who is mentioned in verse 98 quoted
above as " सूर्यजासेवक ":--
_folio 53 - " पश्चात्तां समलंकृतां तपनजादासो ददौ शंभवे । olot

" सख्यं साप्तपदीनमाहुरपि ये etc. ॥ १३५॥"
The nuptials were celebrated at a city called variously as 'मिहिरनगर'
or 'तपननगर' 'तपनपत्तन.' सत्यादास was the अधिपति of the city and it was at
his request that King si proceeded to that city for his nuptials:--
folio 42-"सत्यादासोप्यथ नृपतये भूरिदायापि दत्वा।
तारं हारं वलययुगलं निःप्रवाणिद्वयं च ॥
आवासार्थ मिहिरनगराभ्यंतरे तं ययाचे ।
प्रौढप्रेमासकलपृतनासंयुतं सौधराजौ ।। ३३ ॥"
People of the town gathered to have a look at King siy:-
folio 42 - " जग्मुर्वासोरुचिरतनवः सर्वतः प्रेक्षणार्थ । .
लोकाः सर्वे नरपतिमणेः संघशः पण्यवीथ्यां ॥
- संविभ्राणाश्चपलवपुषः पाणिभिर्बालकान्स्वान् ।
आधावंतस्त्वरितमभितश्वासमुत्फुल्लनेत्राः ॥ ३५॥"
-- * And ladies were not behind men in their curiosity to have a peep
at the King. Their hurried movements are described in the patent
classical style. The following verse will serve as an example :--
folio 44- “भूपेक्षार्थ त्वरितगमनप्रोद्यता विद्युताभा-।
ऽशक्ता गंतुं चपलचरणन्यासमौत्सुक्यनुन्ना ॥
काचित्स्थूलस्तनयुगभराक्रान्तिसंस्तब्धचारं ।

सत्यादास got down from his elephant and welcomed King शंभुः--
folio 45--" इत्थं यातं मिहिरनगराभ्यंतरे शंभुराज

After the marriage King Sambhu starts on his return journey in a
chariot accompanied by his bride चंपाः-

The Governor of atata accompanied the returning party for some
distance but was asked by King Sambhu in touching words to return:
folio 71-" ततस्तपनपत्तनाधिपतिमागतं दूरतो।

King Sambhu returned to his capital and passed a few days of happy
married life but shortly afterwards got the news of an enemy attacking
his capital and forces:--
folio 74- ततः किल स सुश्रुवान्स्वनगरीमतिव्याकुलाम-।

समेत्य सचिवैः समं तदनु मानसं भूपति-। का

Personal prowess of King Sambhu in the battle is described:--
folio 76--"मुहुर्मुहुरतिस्वनन्पृथुलमंडलेष्वासनो।
यांबुद इवाद्भुतां बहलबाणवृष्टिं सृजन् ॥
करांकुरवरस्फुरत्कचकचंचलाप्रांचितः। का

And Goddess of Victory crowned him with success in the battle:--
folio 81-“निर्गत्याहवसागराद्वहुसरदत्तौघकल्लोलिनो।
heed

The Ta of King Sambhu blessed him on the successful termination
of the battle:--
_folio 81 -- “आशीर्भिनंदयित्वा गुरुरपि स गुरुं क्षमापतीनां सकंपा।

The गुरु of Sambhuraja by name श्रीकृष्णपंडित was apparently an
influential person as the following verses tell us:

(4) Etala ( Son of No. 3-see verses 177 and 170).
It appears that Hari Kavi's father Nārāyaṇa who was originally a
Deccani Brahman ( GTIGOAT90:- v. 169 ) had settled at Surat as he is
called 'मिहिरपत्तनाध्यासन' (v. 169) i. e. resident of मिहिरपत्तन which is the same as
Tigr or Surat mentioned in the colophons. It appears that Hari Kavi also
was residing at Surat or asign and consequently the scene of King
Sambhu's marriage with siq is laid in fÀIETATT ( folio 45 ) which appears
to be identical with higtaan of which Hari Kavi's father altra was
resident as stated in verse 169. How far this fact is true to history I am
unable to say at present.
In verse 172 quoted above we are told that this poem was composed
by the order of (निदेशतः ) one कृष्ण known as the गुरु of King शंभु ( = शंभु

The date of composition recorded in verse 178 of the colophon is

records the above date of composition was found pasted to another stray
folio with some written matter on both the sides. This stray folio records
on one side the colophon of some work on phala-jyotişa or astrology conta-

conclude that our Ms of Sambhurāja-Carita is a contemporary copy
perhaps made in the very year of its composition viz. A. D. 1685, its last
folio being pasted on another stray folio written one year earlier i. e. in
1684 as pointed out above. The other side of the stray folio contains some
written matter concluded by 3 verses ascribed to Hari Kavi as under:-

Harikayi alias Bhānubhatta

It is clear that the above extract contains the beginning of some
poetical work of चक्रपाणि as the expression " चक्रपाणिकविता” in verse 5
above shows. I shall now prove that this TÆTTO is identical with the
brother of Sri Hari Kavi, the author of Subhasitahārāvali. aand
Dr. Hara Datta Sharma in his article 8 on Śri Hari Kavi, the author
of Subhāṣitahārāvali remarks :-
" Hari Kavi was the pupil of Nārāyaṇa, one of whose verses he
quotes and refers to it as श्रीनारायणगुरुचरणानाम् ." His youngest brother was
called चक्रपाणिकवि and he is referred to by Hari Kavi as 'मत्कनिष्ठभ्राता' or
अस्मदानुजचक्रपाणि कवि.' It seems that our poet had other brothers but we
find no account of them. This warior differs from the 19th mentioned
in कवींद्रवचनसमुच्चय (p. 37 ) सदुक्तिकर्णामृत (p. 53 ) and पद्यावलि of रूपगोस्वामित्
(fol. 268, v. 258).
Dr. Sharma then quotes two verses introduced by Hari Kavi as
composed by his brother चक्रपाणि. They are:-
(१)" कृपापांगाद्यस्य श्रयति रसनां शुभ्रवसना।
......भगवानेकरदनः
Thurce .........भगवानेकरदनः
c ameras
comoda -मत्कनिष्ठभ्रातुः चक्रपाणिकवेः "
(२)" श्लाघ्य (घ) न्ते महिमानमद्य कवयः स्वीयं न हृष्टान्तराः ।
के के काव्यकराः परन्तु गरिमा श्रीचक्रपाणेर्गुरुः ( रोः ? )
बिंबद्वेषिदले यदास्यकमले क्षोदाभदन्तामले।
वाग्देवी कमलेव विश्वहृदयप्रहलादिनी खेलति ॥
माdिios
-मत्कनिष्ठभ्रातुश्चक्रपाणिकवेः”
(fol. 33. V. 124)
It will be now seen that verse No. 2 quoted above is exactly identical
with v. 4 of the चक्रपाणिकविता stray folio viz. " श्लाघते......खेलति.” This
identity proves beyond doubt that Sri Hari Kavi, the author of Subhāșita-
hārāvali refers in his anthology to the verses of his brother culled from
the " चक्रपाणिकविता" Ms, a stray folio of which has been preserved in the
Ms of शंभुराजचरित of Hari Kavi. This association of चक्रपाणि with the
author of Thafa raises the question about the identity of the two
Hari Kavis viz. (1) हरिकवि, the author of सुभाषितहारावलि and (2) हरिकवि,
the author of शंभुराजचरित. I shall now prove that both these authors are
identical. My grounds for establishing this identity are :-
3 Indian Hist..Quarterly Vol. X, No. 3 pp. 478-4852 05

Page 125****************************************************************************************
112
Studies in Indian Literary History
(1) Dr. Sharma observes 1 about Hari Kavi, the author of सुभाषित-
हारावलि :-
“The author Sri Hari Kavi seems to have been a poet of high order.
He boasts of himself in the following verse :--
येनैकः कवितावतारसमये ग्रंथः समुल्लासित।
स्तस्या एव सुविश्रमे पुनरहो बंधः परो निर्मितः ॥”
तस्या लास्यविधौ कृतास्तु बहवस्ते ते प्रबंधोत्तमाः
सोऽयं कोऽपि हरिः कविः कविरविज्योति:कणो दीव्यति ॥
(tol. 33a v. 123)
The above verse is identical with v. 163 on folio
233
of the Ms of
शंभुराजचरित incorporated in the long extract quoted above. Perhaps it may
have been taken from the Sambhurāja-Carita by the author of Subhāṣita-
hārāvali. This identity of verses is sufficient to establish the identity of
the two Hari Kavis.
(2) Mr. M. Krishnamacharya' in his book on Sanskrit Literature
remarks about Hari Kavi the author of Subhāṣitahārāvali:--
“ His native country however appears to be the Dekkan and he
betrays a very close acquaintance with the literature of his country.”
These remarks are to some extent borne out by the colophon of the
Sambhuraja-Carita. We have stated above that Hari Kavi's father नारायण
was the resident of मिहिरपत्तन or सूर्यपुर or Surat but he is said to be 'दाक्षिणा-
त्यान्वय' (v. 169 of the colophon).
(3) Dr. Sharma states about the author of Subhāṣitahārāvali:-
“ Among various other poets Hari Kavi mentions the names of the follow-
ing with reverence as-
I रामजित्पंडितानाम् II लक्ष्मीधरपादानाम्
____III माधवपुरीपादानाम् . IV महीश्वरपुरीपादानाम्
_v मधसूदनसरस्वतीनाम् - VI अनंतदेवानाम्
VII श्रीकृष्णपंडितानाम् VIII श्रीराघवचैतन्यानाम् ।
IX श्रीबोपदेवपंडितानाम् ___x गोपीनाथपंडितानाम्
XI सोमजिभट्टानाम् .
It is possible to make a conjecture that these people were either
Hari Kavi's contemporaries or preceded him shortly."
Dr. Sharma's conjecture that some of these people were Hari Kavi's
contemporaries appears to be corroborated so far as Fcutifsa is concerned.

Harikavi alias Bhānubhatta
113
We have seen above that the TUTH ata mentions him as the Ta of King
Sambhu and describes him in two verses (124 and 125 on folio 82).
Besides we are told that Hari Kavi composed the Sambhurājacarita at the
bidding of this situísa ( v. 172 on folio –
1 233 E esti
2010
(4) As regards the parentage of the author of the Sambhurājacarita
and that of the Subhāṣitahārāvali I have to observe as follows :-
(i) The colophons of the different Sargas of the Sambhurājācarita
uniformly call हरिकवि as ' नारायणसूरिसूनु' i. e. son of नारायणसूरि. Then again
verse 177 of the extract from the colophon quoted above and verse 153
on folio 42 use the adjective' ariqa ' with reference to Hari Kavi.
197
He is also called ' altitfor: ' in verse 163 in the top margin of folio .
All these expressions prove that नारायण was the father of हरिकवि. .
(ii) Dr. Sharma states that Hari Kavi, the author of gafaagiziare
was the pupil of नारायण as he refers to him as ' नारायणगुरुचरणानाम्.' The
statement of the colophons in the शंभुराजचरित makes it clear that नारायणसूरि
was the father of gftäfa. The title of here is significant as ATTITU was
not only the father of gafa but his Te as well, because in verse 168 he
is mentioned as गुरुवर ( नारायणनामको गुरुवरः) which corresponds to the title
aft used in the colophons. It is, therefore, clear that one and the same
person artigo Was both the ya and the father of Hari Kavi. In verse 153
(Folio ) Hari Kavi calls himself • AITITUTGIF 'in addition to his
233
being • arigeHa.' Verse 164 (folio 22 ) informs us that his family
attained pre-eminence owing to the grace of an ascetic ( tlaat) of the
name of atten.
The identity of the two Hari Kavis is in my opinion sufficiently
established on the strength of the evidence recorded above. It is now easy
to fix the date of Subhāṣitahārāvali. In this connection we quote Dr.
Sharma's conclusion: -1 balle
"As Hari Kavi quotes the verses of Panditarāja Jagannatha, he
cannot be a contemporary of Akbar. Therefore, he must have flourished
in the middle of the 17th century A. D.".

This conclusion of Dr. Sharma is confirmed in general by our study
of the Sambhurājacarita because it was composed in A. D. 1685 and beca-
use of our identification of the author of the Subhāṣitahārāvali and the
Sambhurājacarita as stated above. As regards the chronological order of
these two works we are unable to decide because the verse common to
both these works is not indicated by the name of its source. A glance at
the varied and rich contents of the Subhāșitahārāvali will show, however,
that Hari Kavi was a voracious reader and perhaps this encyclopaedic
anthology containing gems of Sanskrit poetry culled from innumerable
sources beginning from poets and poetasters of hoary antiquity down to
his contemporary Krşņapaņdita and even his younger brother Cakrapāņi,
served as a good discipline for a budding poet of Hari Kavi's classical
taste so as to enable him to write an independent mahākāvya in 12 cantos
bubbling with the essence of Sanskrit classical poetry and devoted to-the
glorification of King Sambhājī, whose gay personality afforded him an
excellent opportunity to make a colourful display of a princely career, which
has been estimated by some modern historians as politically effete and
ünwise,
My brief analysis of the Sambhurājacarita based on the available
fragment of this mahākāvya will, it is hoped, remove doubts, if any, of
modern historians about the identity of the hero of this poem with King
Sambhāji, the son of Shivāji. I shall, however, sum up the main facts
revealed in my analysis which support my identification of Sambhurāja
with King Sambhāji:-
(1) Date of composition of the poem viz. A. D. 1685 corresponds to
Sambhāji's period of reign.
et (2) The birth of शंभुनृपति from शिवनृप and the adjectives शिवभव, शिवोद्भव
as applied to gig in many places as pointed out by me in the preamble
of this paper clearly indicate the parentage of the Maratha King.
(3) The reference to the sword of the goddess warait in the hands
of King Sambhu and its description in three verses as pointed out by me
also confirm my identification.
se
(4) The mention of Thigh 1...... Hiffa' with reference to Sambhu.
rāja is also important. Shivāji was called 'Thalattial and his son

Sambhāji was expected to follow his father in keeping this motto before
him as a state policy at a time when Hinduism was regarded to be in peril.
(5) The poet Hari Kavi may have resided occasionally at Sambhā.
ji's court, though he himself and his father may have been normally
residents of gr or Surat. As the poem was composed at the bidding of
Sambhāji's ſo by name şcolisa such an inference is warranted. At any
rate a greater contact of the courtly life of King Sambhāji may be presum.
ed in view of the dominant note of gaiety prevailing in the portion of this
mabākāvya analysed by me. The poet's family belonged originally to the
Deccan as his father is called ' GTISTUTETIFay' and naturally he must have
entertained a high regard for a King of the Deccan territories, though
Surat was at this period of history in the hands of foreigners.
My friend Prof. H. D. Velanker has already published a " Sanskrit
work called TT ( Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Govt. Ori.
Series, 1926 ) claiming for its author King Sambhu, popularly known as
Sambhāji, son of Shivāji the Great ” and has thus retrieved the lost name
of King Sambbāji as " nothing but vicious deeds, at the most brave and
daring, are usually connected with the name of Prince Sambhāji.” About
Sambhāji's literary taste Prof. Velankar remarks :-"- it is possible to
conclude that not only had Sambhāji received education at the hands of
learned Pandits but he had also taste for Sanskrit literature and was occa-
sionally in the habit of writing poetry in Hindi under the influence of Kayi
Kalaśa or the celebrated Kalusha, especially when passing his leisure
hours in the company of beautiful women.” In his Preface Prof. Velankar
refers to Sambhāji's Hindi Poems, selections from which were shown to
him by Mr. Purushottam Vishram Mavji, J. P. Then again verses 1 16
and 15 in the preamble of Budhabhūşaņa clearly refer to Sambhāji's
contact with learned men well versed in Poetry, Rhetoric, Purāņas, Music
and Archery.
5 Hari Kavi, a poet of no mean talents, must have been foremost
among the learned men patronized by Sambhāji and in my opinion his
present mahākāvya gives an added lustre to the cultural history of
Sambhāji's reign.

Studies in Indian Literary History
About Kalusha, the enchanter, who exerted a wonderful influence
upon Sambhāji Prof. Velankar remarks :-
"Among the quotations we find one from the pen of famous Kalusha.
It is highly poetical and even though we unfortunately do not possess
any literary remains of this great favourite of King Sambhāji, we have
grounds to believe that he was a literary man. In the old chronicles
he is described as Kavikalasa or the poet Kalasa." “ We will not be,
however, far from truth in assuming that to a considerable extent his
literary gifts helped Kalusha to maintain his influence with the prince.
It is quite possible that this Kavi Kalusha may have composed several
poems, which were not preserved owing to the general disfavour in
which he was held, but stray copies of which may yet have existed and
might one day be discovered by us."
These remarks of Prof. Velankar tempt me to infer by way of pure
hypothesis that soifea who is described in two verses as the ya of King
Sambhu in the Sambhurājacarita may be identical with Kavikalaśa, the
Kanuja Brahman who is popularly believed to have been purposely sent
by the Emperor from Delhi. Hari Kavi, as Dr. Sharma tells us, refers to
some verses of this pandit and introduces them in his Subhāșitahārāvali
by the expression “stacorgfsatar.” Then again in the Sambhurājacarita
Hari Kavi states that he wrote by order (faena: ) of one or who was the
ut of even King Sambhu ( SİYArtuaala TTT:). All these references show
the great influence Fujifta held over King Sambhāji and it is possible
that he may have been identical with the great enchanter of Sambhāji,
popularly known as Kavi Kalaśa. This identification is however, suggested
as a mere hypothesis as among other accomplishments of sorgfsa given
in the two verses on folio 82 quoted above we find that he is called
" *Sestaraan " and "gata: qfafa: agregara: TIGHT:"-
expressions which may hint at his cleverness in political chicanery, so
characteristic of Kavi Kalaśa, the great enchanter of King Sambhāji.
__Irrespective of our proposed identification of कृष्णपंडित with कवि कलश
it would be useful to put on record verses quoted by Hari Kavi in his
Subhāșitahārāvali and ascribed to furgísa for the reason that he is men-
tioned as the of King Sambhu in the Sambhurājacarita. If any poems
of fat are traced hereafter by historians the verses recorded below
may prove useful in studying the question of our proposed identity of the
two personalities. I, therefore, quote these verses from the fragment of

We have seen above that in the old chronicles Sambhāji's adviser
Kalusha is described as कविकलश. In the above verses of कृष्णपंडित he styles
himself as æfà confsa apparently emphasizing his poetical talents and
perhaps echoing the identity of his Sanskrit name wla psut with the
popular name कवि कलश.

Since the above paper was written I have analysed Mss of हैहयेंद्रकाव्य
represented by the following entry in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum,
Part I, 768:-

Page 131****************************************************************************************

Studies in Indian Literary History
- " हैहयेन्द्रकान्य and tika by Hari, Report CLXX -Comm. by शंभु ibid"
Mss represented by this entry of Aufrecht are available in the Goyt..
Mss Library. They are:--(1) No. 827 of 1875-76. (2) No. 828-0f 1875-76
and (3) No. 829 of 1875–76. They were acquired from Surat by Dr. Bühler
in 1875. Aufrecht's entry about the author of this Kāvya and commentary.
is misleading because we find that this Kāvya was written by Hari Kavi,
the author of Subhāșitahārāvali and the Sambhurājacarita.
__Ms No. 828 of 1875-76- This is a fragment of हैहयेन्द्रकाव्यटीका of
हरिकवि. Some of its folios are not numbered but it consists of 46 folios. It
was copied in Samvat 1779 i. e. in A. D. 1723 as the following colophon
shows:--
" इति श्री सूर्यपुरस्थितश्रीनारायणसूरिसूनुहरिकविविरचितायां श्री हैहयद्रचरिताख्य-
महाकाव्यव्याख्यायां शंभुविलासिकाख्यायामष्टमः सर्गः ॥ समाप्तः ॥ श्री ॥ श्रीरस्तु ॥ संवत् १७७९
वर्षे फाल्गुन शुदि १ रवौ समाप्तिमगमत् "
The above colophon makes it clear that this commentary was
written by हरिकवि. The poem commented on is a महाकाव्य called हैहयेन्द्रचरित
and the name of this commentary is ' शंभुविलासिका.' We have no means of
ascertaining the number of cantos of this महाकाव्य of हरिकवि but the above
colophon of canto VIII proves that it must have been somewhat like the
Sambhurājacarita in its extent. The references to earlier works and
authors found in this fragment are:--

Ms No. 829 of 1875–76--This fragment of infastfeat consists of
about 76 folios of which folios 1 to 68 contain the commentary for canto
Iof हैहयेन्द्रचरित, while folios 69 to 76 contain a portion of the commen-
tary for canto II ( 12 verses only). This Ms is very important for our
present study as it furnishes more particulars about Hari Kavi. The
first 10 verses refer to नारायण, the गुरु of Hari Kavi, and also refer
to his patron शंभुपृथ्वीपति who is styled as शैव i. e. born of शिव or Shivaji
(verses 7 and 8). We are also told explicitly that this commentary was
composed by the order of Sambhāji and that the Kāvya was composed
by Hari Kavi himself (verse 10 ).
This statement proves that Hari Kavi must have been a court-poet
of King Sambhāji to receive direct orders of King Sambhāji unlike his
composition of Sambhurājacarita which, as we have seen above, was com-
posed at the bidding of कृष्णपंडित, the गुरु, of Sambhaji. Perhaps this गुरु
may have brought Hari Kavi into prominence and royal favour recogni-
zing his poetic talents and learning, being himself कवि and पंडित (' कवि-
कृष्णपंडित'). I shall now quote the introductory 12 verses of this Ms as no-
other copies of this work are available so far:

Verse No. 1 in the above extract viz. " श्रीमान्गजेंद्रवदन ... सजिहानं
is almost identical with verse No. 2 in the astforala at extract quoted by
me above from a stray folio found in the Ms of शंभुराजचरित. So also verse
No. 4. viz. " फुल्लपत्रशतपत्रलोचना ... ददातु मे" is almost identical with verse
No. 3 of the चक्रपाणिकविता fragment. It is possible that the brother चक्रपाणि
in his enthusiasm to outdo his elder brother may have incorporated
these verses from the latter's works without acknowledgement though the
older brother Hari Kavi bad better sense of literary veracity as he has
introduced all verses of his younger brother 7 ifo with the expression
“मत्कनिष्ठभ्रातुः चक्रपाणे:” in his Subhāsitahārāvali.
As this fragment of stylagini contains a portion of the commentary
different from that found in Ms No 828 of 1875–76 it would be useful to

The above list of references combined with the list of references in
the other fragment of this commentary given previously shows us the
range of Hari Kavi's studies and in my opinion justifies the self-conscious
and somewhat boastful reference to his capacities and attainments -
occasionally found in his works noticed above.3 0
_ The hero of हैहयेन्द्रचरित is हैहयेन्द्र or कार्तवीर्य and his identity with
King siy is too transparent for the poet to hide behind apparently godly
environment in which he has been put by the poet. The heroine is none
other than चंपा, who appears also to be the heroine of शंभुराजचरित as we
have seen above in our analysis of this महाकाव्य. On folio 14 of this Ms
the poet apparently discloses the identity of Tyria with tear in the
following explanation :-
"अथस्वसंभावनाकरमेतत्काव्यकरणहेतुभूतशंभुनामकराजविशेषं श्लाघस्तन्नगरादिक वर्णयति
पुरमिति etc."
16

Page 135****************************************************************************************

Studies in Indian Literary History
The poet also refers to siqi as the affeat of the poem in the follow-
ing remarks on folios 29-30:--
"कलशीलरूपादिगुणगणशालिचंपानामकनायिकां वर्णयन्”
He also refers to this sit as the beauty of the town of Surat in the
following words on folio 50:-
____ "तथा श्रीमान्मिहिरनगरस्य, शोभमानसूरपुरस्य, द्योतनकरां प्रकाशनकरी, शोभासमुत्पादि-
कामित्यर्थः ।"
This heroine is shown to have attained a marriageable age on folio
31-- “परमसुंदरवराभिलशिनी .. एषा चंपाख्या, षोडशवार्षिकी इति यावत्"
Wa have tried to prove from the statements of हरिकवि in the शंभुराज-
चरित that नारायण was both the गुरु and father of हरिकवि. This inference is
clearly proved by the following statement of this poet in this commentary:-
। Folio 68-- " श्री नारायणेति । श्रीः सर्वविद्याज्ञानशोभासंपञ्चतया युक्तो नारायणः,
तनामको गुरुः पिता च"
We have also seen that Hari Kavi's family came from the Deccan
and that both the father and the son were residents of Surat. Here is
Hari Kavi's own explanation about his Deccani descent :--
Folio 68-" दाक्षिणात्येषु महाराष्ट्राभिधदक्षिणदिग्भवब्राह्मणेषु अन्वीयते युज्यते
इति अन्वयो वशो यस्यास्तौ"
- The colophon of Canto I appears as under on folio 68 and it is very
important as it discloses for the first time in our study the popular
name of the poet, which is भानुभट्ट :-" इति श्रीसूर्यपूरस्थित श्रीमन्नारायणसूरिसूनु-
प्रसिद्धभानुभट्टापराभिधहरिकविविरचितायां स्वकृतहैहयेंद्रचरिताख्यकाव्यव्याख्यायां श्रीशंभुविला-
शिकाख्यायां प्रथमः सर्गः समाप्तः". Perhaps this real name of the poet viz. भानुभट्ट
may afford historians a better clue to trace the descendants in this family
than the poetic name yrafaused throughout his works.
Throughout this paper we have identified augo with modern Surat.
Our identification is supported by Hari Kavi himself for on folio 74 he
explains “ सूरस्य सूर्यस्येदं सौरं सूरताख्य प्रसिद्धाभिधमित्यर्थः"
and further he refers to the beauty of Surat in these words :-"aidt-
परिवारितसूरपूरशोभाया दुर्लभत्वात् इति भावः."
On folio 75 he explains the reference to mountain Here in the text
of his Kavya :-“महेन्द्रः कौंकणदेशस्थः कुलपर्वतः."
Ms No. 827 of 1875-76-- We now come to the fragment of the text
of हैहयैन्द्रकाव्य, the commentary on which we have noticed above in our

analysis of the two available fragments. This Ms consists of 39 folios,
folios 1 to 20 comprising canto I and folios 20 to 40 comprising canto II.
This poem appears to have been written in a sustained style in the
classical fashion and in doing so the poet is apparently influenced by
Jagannātha Paņditarāya, quotations of whose verses have been given by our
poet in the Subhāşita hārāvali. Here is his appreciation of Panditarāya's
poetic composition on folio 21 of the present Ms :-
कमलपटलस्फारत्स्फूर्जन्मनोहरसौरभो।
न्मदमधुकरश्रेणीसिंजासमुद्गतमाधुरी।
न हि सुभगतां लोके विंदत्यनेकगुणाद्भुतां ।
कविवरजगन्नाथोदंचद्वचो रचनावलेः॥"
The poet refers to attito Te in verse 8 of this Kāvya which begins
on folio 2 with:-
____“नमः श्रीमन्नारायणगुरुपदांभोजरजसे" and ends...."प्रकाशंते कामं कविवरकृता-
नेकनुतयः"
On folio 4 the following verses 24 and 25 appear and I find they
appear in the T rafa with identical verse numbers. These verses are:--
___" इहासीन्नासीरं रुचिरतनुभाजा त्रिभवने ।
शिवाख्यो देशानामधिपतिरनेकाद्भुतगणः। O mepreistar
यमालोक्योत्फल्लद्विपुलनयनोदीर्णनिमिषाः। Bedroonga sacodese

सुधीरो गंभीरो विपुलधिषणोत्यंतरमणो। alotodates
वदान्यो नेहान्यो जगति शिवभूपाद्विजयते ॥ २५॥"
The following verse 29 is identical with verse 26 in the शंभुराजचरित
referred to by us in the beginning of this paper :- D
“प्रदीपो दीपांगादिव गगनरत्नादिव महा-1
महः पुंजपनादिव परमसौरम्यनिवहः ।
सुधांशुः क्षीराब्धेरिव हरितरुनंदनवना-।
दिवायं संभूतं किल शिवनृपाछंभृनृपतिः ॥ २७ ॥"
As in the case of the commentary on this Kāvya, Hari Kavi states
that he got the order of the King Sambhu to compose the हैहयेन्द्रचरित:-
" अमुष्याज्ञां प्राप्य स्वकसकलप्रापप्रहतये ।
तथा साफल्यार्थ ललितललितानां निजगिरां ।

Studies in Indian Literary History
In the above analysis of all the available fragmentary Mss of Hari
Kavi's works we have tried to lay bare some historical information but
have not attempted to identify or verify the same from other historical
sources. Such an attempt must be made independently by scholars in-
terested in the history of the period to which King Sambhāji belongs.
We have attempted in the present study to give a rough sketch of Hari
Kavi and his works written under the patronage of King Sambhāji.

14. Date of Sabhyalamkarana, an Anthology
by Govindajit - After A. D. 1656 *
The only MS of a work “Sabhyālamkaraņa” mentioned by
Aufrecht 1 is "Rgb 417 (fr.), which is identical with MS No. 417 of 1884-
8y in the Govt. MSS Library at B. O. R. Institute, Poona. Sir R. G.
Bhandarkar in his Report 2 for 1887–91 does not deal with the date of this
work. As this work is a rhetorical anthology of verses from various
poets and works, it has its place in the history of the mediaeval Sanskrit
anthologies. I propose, therefore, to analyse the only MS of Sabhyālamka-
raņa viz. No. 417 of 1884–87 and indicate my evidence regarding the limits
for its date.
The work is divided into numerous sections called marīcis or rays.
The name of the author is Govindaji 3. He was the son of Caku and was
resident of Girīpura. 4 He belonged to the Mevādā caste of Medapāta
(Mewad ) as will be seen from the following statements :
folio 2—“gfa fafigtlaaifauzapaaga (?) titlã fHtiTEtà etc.”
" इति गिरिपुरवर्तिभट्टचकुतनयश्रीमेदपाठमध्यस्थभट्टमेवाडाज्ञातीय भट्ट-
folio 3 — 3 stjäaforessa EITHAT etc."
The title of the work is सभ्यालंकारण (colophon on folio 9 ) or सभ्याभरण :
(Colophon on folio 3). The work is compiled somewhat on the lines of the
Rasikajīvana 6 of Gadādharabhatta. In fact one Gadādhara is mentioned
as the author of some verses quoted on folios 12 and 34.
The following works and authors have been mentioned in the
fragment of the Sabhyālamkarana before us:-
* New Indtan Antiquary Vol. IV, No. 11, February 1942, pp. 366-369.
1. CC, II, 166 - Aufrecht mentions another work called MUSTATUT wbich seems to be
different from
UT.
2. Vide pp. lxii - Ixiii of Report for 1887-91 - Here we find merely a list of works and
authors mentioned in the fragment of Sabhyālamkarana.
3. According to Sir R. G. Bhandarkar "Govindajit" is a Sanskritized form of "Govindajë."-
4. I wonder if Giripura is identical with Girinagara or Girnar in Junagad State.
5. Aufrecht (CC I, 696) records a Kävya of the title ATTITUT by Rāmacandra with a
commentary by Govinda (B. 2.110). I cannot say if this commentator Govinda is identical with.
Govindaji, the author of सभ्यालंकरण.
6. Vide my paper on the Rasikajīvana (Annals B. O. R. I. Vol. XII, p. 396).

The above list is sufficient to show the sources of the present anthology.
The reference to Bhatta Kamalākara on folio 3 furnishes us with a clue
about the limit to the date of this anthology. If this Bhatta Kamalākara
is identical with the author of the Nirņayasindhu ( composed in A. D.
1612 ) we can safely presume that Govindajit composed his anthology
after A. D. 1612.
A more exact reference, however, for purposes of chronology will
be found on folio 29, where a work called “fantaa" is mentioned.
This work appears to be identical with the work fahafrafra by Nīlakaạtha
Sukla of which two MSS are available in the Govt. MSS Library at the
B. O. R. Institute, Poona. I have proved in my note 1 on this work
that it was composed in Samvat 1712 = A. D. 1656. The verse from the
Cimanišataka quoted by Govindajit on folio 29 of the MS of the Sabhyā.
lamkarana is identical with verse 99 of the Cimanicarita (MS No. 698 of
1886–92). This identity clearly proves that Govindajit composed his
anthology after A. D. 1656. The other limit to the date of Sabhyālamkarana
cannot be definitely fixed at present but as the MS of the work appears to
be about 150 years old we may tentatively assign Govindajit to the first
quarter of the 18th century, if not later.

SD 15. Date of Kes'avabhatta of Punyastambha, the el
Author of Nrsimhacampū and other Works -
Between c. A. D. 1450 and 1575*
My friend Prof. N. A. Gore intends to bring out a critical edition of
the Nysimha Campū of Daivajña Sūryapandita. He has asked me to fix the
date of another Nysimha Campū by Keśavabhatta of Punyastambha as
there is some resemblance between the two Campūs. I have great pleasure
in recording the following evidence about Keśava and his works, which
may enable us to fix his date within as narrow limits as possible:-
Prof. Dr. G. V. Devasthali describes some MSS of the works of
Kesava in his Catalogue of the Bombay University MSS (1944-Vols.
I and II):-
Vol. I, p. 348 - MS No. 968 - अन्त्येष्टिपद्धति of केशव, a manual of funeral rites
composed by Keśava, son of Anantabhatta of the Laugākşi
family and a resident of Punyastambha ( modern Puņtāmbe
in the Ahmadnagar Dist. of Bombay State). नृसिंहचम्पू and
न्यायचन्द्रिका are other works of this author. Cf. Velankar
No. 1249 and India office Nos. 4053-54 and 5769-76.
This MS was copied by Sakhārāma Abābhatta
Pathaka in Saka 1699 =A. D. 1777. The work quotes from
विधानमाला.
The MS begins :-
" यच्छिष्यैर्जगतीतलं परिवृतं यः सर्वविद्यानिधिः
श्रीलौगाक्षिकुलारविन्दतरणिर्माध्यन्दिनिः केशवः ।
यं प्रासूत सदाशिवांघ्रिकमलद्वन्द्वैकनिष्ठं परं

नानानिबन्धानालोक्य पुण्यस्तम्बपुरः (om.: ) स्थितः ।

The MS ends :-
" इति माध्यन्दिनीय लौगाक्षिगोत्र (or त्रा)नन्तभट्टसुतकेशवे नै वा (१)
विरचितान्त्येष्टिपद्धतिः समाप्ता ॥"
Vol. II, p.780-MS No. 2287 - नृसिंहचंपू of केशव is a small Campa in 6
chapters narrating the story of Nțsimhāvatāra composed by
* Swāmi Kevalānanda Commemoration Volume, 1952, pp. 129-137.

Keśavabhatta- Author of Nțsimhacampū
133
Keśava of the Laugākşi family, a resident of Puṇyastambha
on the bank of the Godāvarī (For other MSS see Velankar
No. 1249 and India Office No. 4053). Keśava wrote another
work on this topic known as JETFT written at the
command of king Umāpati Dalapati (cf. India office No.
4054 and Rajendralal Mitra's Notices, No. 1427 ). For
quotations from the work see Ind. Office No. 4053. Keśava
composed two more works, the 59147igt (see No. 1992)
and अन्त्येष्टिपद्धति ( see No. 963).
Vol. II, p. 669 – MS No. 1992 - 12ëfgefall of 2017. This is an elementary
treatise on Indian logic composed by Keśava who is
different from Keśava, the author of Tarkabhāṣā. For our
author's Strafegefa see MS No. 963 above.
As MS No. 963 87-cigrala ) of Keśava is dated A. D. 1777 we may
push his date to a period which is earlier than about A. D.
1750.
The Govt. MSS Library at the Bhandarkar O. R. Institute
possesses some MSS of Kesava's works. I record below the evidence of
these MSS bearing oPthe history and chronology of Keśava's works:-
(1) MSS of artaqrq:-
(1) MS No. 413 of 1887-91-qišaty. This MS is dated Samvat
1750 ( = A. D. 1694 ).

(12) MS No. 513 of 1891-95 - नृ. चम्पू - MS dated Samvat 1839
(= A. D. 1783).
We have thus MSS of नृ. चम्पू bearing dates A. D. 1694, 1783, 1789,
1795, 1798, 1799.
All these MSS are described by me in Volume XIII, Part III of the
Descriptive Catalogue of the Gort. MSS library (B. 0. R.
Institute, Poona, 1950 ) pages 355-368.
(II) MSS of न्यायचन्द्रिका :-
(1) MS No. 796 of 1887-91 - not dated.
4 (2) MS No. 138 of 1871-72 - MS dated sam. 1706 (=A. D. 1650) 1
(3) MS No. 206 of 1899-1915 - not dated.
(III) MSS of अन्त्येष्टिपद्धतिः-
MS No. 180 of 1886-92-not dated. The MS begins exactly like the
Bombay University MS of this work ( No. 963 ) and is
incomplete (15 folios ). The last folio 16 contains a
different work. There are colophons in the body of the
text mentioning the name ata, mn of staa.
The author refers to a few earlier authors and their works, such as
याज्ञवल्क्य: (fol 7 ) ; अंगिरः (fol. 7); " मदनपारिजाते । पाराशरमाधवीये" (fol. 10);
भविष्यत्पुराणे (fol. 10 ); गौतमः (fol. 10); गालवः ( fol. 10 ); आपस्तंब ( fol. 11 );
व्यास (fol. 10); वाराहपुराण (fol. 12 ); पैठीनसिः (fol. 14 ); शिवस्वामिमत (fol. 13);
दीपिका ( fol. 14); रेणुकाकारिका ( fol. 14); विश्वादर्श ( fol. 15 ) etc.
The dates of some of these works as given by Dr. P. V. Kane in his
History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. I (B. O. R. Institute, Poona, 1930 ) are as
follows:-
Page 889 - (1) मदनपारिजात by Madanapāla - Between A. D. 1860 and 1890.

Keśavabhatta - Author of Nșsim hacampū
Page 625 - (4) faranga by #faragtiaat - later than A. D. 1100 and earlier
than A. D. 1200.
In view of the above evidence and in particular in view of the refe-
rence to açaneta ( between A. D. 1360 and 1390) by our author Keśava
we can definitely say that he is later than c. A. D. 1400, which is, therefore,
the earlier limit for the dates of his works. The later limit is furnished
by the B.O. R. Institute MS of =917ali Ft (No. 138 of 1871–72 ) which is
dated Samvat 1706 ( A. D. 1650 ). The India office MS of Keśava's grace
try mentioned below is dated A. D. 1627. I am, therefore, inclined to
believe that Keśava flourished between c. A. D. 1450 and 1575.
The India office Library Catalogue, Vol. I, Part VII (by Eggeling,
London, 1904) contains description (on pp. 1548–49) of two MSS of
Treaty of Keśava viz. No. 4053 and No. 4054. Of these two MSS No.
4054 is dated A. D. 1627 ( Samvat 1684).
Burnell's Catalogue of Tanjore MSS (1879), p. 118, contains descrip-
tion of a MS of a commentary on the Tarkabhāṣā of Keśava Miśra c.
A. D. 1275). The name of this commentator is Keśavabhatta, son of Ananta
and the commentary called Tarkadipikā. These details are recorded in
verses 1 and 2 at the beginning of the work, which are quoted by Burnell
as follows:
"यच्छिष्यैर्जगतीतलं परिवृतम्, यस्तर्कविद्यानिधिः
श्रीलोकाक्षिकुलारविन्दतरणिर्माध्यन्दिनी केशवः ।
यं प्रासूत सदाशिव .. कमलद्वन्द्वैकनिष्ठं परम्

सकलन्यायसिद्धान्तं अवगम्य यथामति ।
HESfagraat fietà aset1981 112 11
It is clear from these verses that Keśavabhatta, the author of gine-
279, pati@refa and =qipart is also the author of the commentary asse
atf921 on Keśava Miśra's a SH19 (. A. D. 1275 1 according to scholars ).
Our author Keśava Miśra composed another Campū called seigar,
a MS of which has been described by Rajendralal Mitra, Notices Vol. IV,
pp. 42 - 43, MS No. 1427. Mitra describes this work as " A poetico-prose
romance, founded on the story of Prahlāda, a youth who, born in a Saiva
family, displayed under peculiarly trying circumstances, the most un.

The above MS contains 214 Slokas and is dated Samvat 1869 ( A.
D. 1813 ). It belongs to Govt. of India. Prof. Gore may get it on loan from
the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, and see if this प्रह्लादचम्पू is identical with नृसिंह-
चम्पू or is a different work.

I have proved above that केशव the author of नृसिंहचम्पू , अन्त्येष्टिपद्धति,
न्यायचन्द्रिका, and प्रह्लादचम्पू is also the author of तर्कदीपिका represented by the
Tanjore MS described by Burnell on p. 118 of his Catalogue of Tanjore MSS.
I could not get detailed description of 371756L-1999ry mentioned as Kesava's
work by Aufrecht. A MS of this work ( N P. X, 16 of Aufrecht's entry ) is
mentioned in the Catalogue of North Western MSS by Sudhākara Dvivedi,

Keśavabbatta – Author of Nșsimhacampū
Part X ( Allahabad, 1886 ) p. 16. The details of this MS as given by
Dyiyedi are as follows:-
Einegaragara-A Campū with commentary of Keśava – 333 leaves-
16,000 Ślokas - on paper in Devanāgarī charac-
ters - in the possession of Bhāgavatācāri of Bena-
res - Old, complete and correct."
If this description is correct the MS contains the Campū and its
commentary by one Keśava. It is not clear if this Keśava is identical with
Keśava, the author of Nysimhacampū and other works.
The evidence recorded so far gives us the following information
about our author :-
(1) His name was gota, His father's name was ama.
(2) He belonged to लौगाक्षिकुल and माध्यन्दिन आम्नाय.
(3) He was proficient in Attiat, aš, afza, etc.
(4) He was the resident of goafata ( modern Puņtāmbe in the Ahmad.
nagar Dist. of the Bombay state ) on the banks of river Godā.
(5) He composed नृसिंहचम्पू and प्रल्हादचम्पू by the order of his patron
JAvfaçayfa, son of stjäceafa.
(6) He composed also refertfa, F71451#1, anselfær and possibly
आनन्दवृन्दावनचम्पू.
(7) He flourished definitely between A. D. 1400 and A. D. 1600 and
approximately between A. D. 1450 and 1575, a period of about 125
years. This period can be narrowed down if we can identify his
_patron उमापति दलपति, son of गोविंद दलपति.1 -
Very probably Jarga qsafa, the patron of Keśavabhatta residing
at Puņtāmbe in the Ahmadnagar District between c. A. D. 1450 and 1575,
belonged to the family of coqfa, son of agh and author of the work on
dharmaśāstra called TIHENAIC composed between A. D. 1490 and 1512.
The points of similarity which go to connect these two Dalapatis may be
represented in the following table :-
1. Dr. P. V. Kane has devoted section 99 of his History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. I (1930) to
a work on Dharmasastra called नृसिंहप्रसाद by दलपति or दलाधीश्वर son of वल्लभ and of the
भारद्वाजगोत्र and याज्ञवल्क्य शाखा. This दलपति was a great exponent of वैष्णवधर्म. He was the
pupil of सूर्यपण्डित and the chief minister and keeper of records of Nizamshah, ruler of देवगिरि.
ÄETAG was composed between A. D. 1490 and 1512 ( page 410 ).

devotion to god Govinda.

दलपति.
(3) God Tina was the family deity
of दलपतिराज, who calls his
work नृसिंहप्रसाद and invokes
god fåg at the beginning of
each section of नृसिंहप्रसाद (the
fruit of the grace of god
giác ).
(4) He was a Brahmin of HITETS-
कुल and याज्ञवल्क्यशाखा. He was
the son of agh and a great
exponent of a curat.
It would seem from the above table that ganga gafa is connected
with दलपतिराज the author of the नृसिंहप्रसाद and his family. "दलपति"
indicates a title of an army officer in command of a body of troops. Later
on it may have become a family name of persons. At present the surname
“ gaat” corresponds to the name " cocfa" current in the 15th and 16th
century in the Deccan. The author of the TÅETAIT being a prominent
member of the “ दलपति" family appears to have been called “ दलपतिराज,"
whom I have identified 1 with “ Dalpat Rai” Mentioned in the Burhan-
i-Masir as aspiring after the office of the Prime Minister of Ahmad Nizam
Shah (A.D. 1490-1508 ). There is possibility of gaila gorfa being
identical with दलपतिराज if we presume that गोविंद the father of उमापति,
and agh, the father of confatis, are identical persons. Even if this

possibility is not accepted it is possible to suggest that gayfa Gotfa and
GETFatih were important Hindu officers, who were great patrons of
learning, in the employ of the Muslim kings, 1 who ruled at Ahmadnagar
from A. D. 1460 to 1637. A Hindu grandes called arasit TaTTin com-
posed an encyclopaedic work on Dharmaśāstra called the TYTagan. He
was patronized by Burhan Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar (A. D. 1508–1554)
as I have proved in a special paper ( Annals, B. O. R. Institute, 1944, vol.
XXIV, pp. 156–164).
Puṇyastambha or Puņtāmbe, the native place of our author
Kesavabhatta was a great centre of learning for centuries. अनन्तपण्डित,
son of त्र्यंबकपण्डित, composed his commentary व्यङ्गयार्थकौमुदी on रसमञ्जरी at
Benares in A. D. 1636. He was also a resident of yozFarh. Tia 8CTI Aisa
who flourished between c. A. D. 1775 and 1820 and composed many Sans-
krit works was also a native of yografH ( Vide my paper on this author
in Annals B. O. R. Institute, 1943, Vol. XXIV pp. 27–44). Agiča grajaat
(c. A. D. 1700 ) the great logician continued the tradition of our author
Keśavabhatta in the study of logic and composed some works on logic
( Vide p. 486 of History of Indian Logic by Vidyabhushan). He also hailed
from Punyastambha or Puņtāmbe. The real history of the contribution of
Mahārāstra to Sanskrit learning is yet to be written. For this purpose
we must fix up the chronology of every author belonging to different
centres of learning in Mahārāstra, whose works have come down to us and
are represented by manuscripts in puplic libraries and in private coll-
ections, which remain still untapped.

name Bhoja in his History of Dharmaśāstra Vol. I, ( 1930 ):-
Page 279 --" There is a work named Dharmapradipa by Bhoja

another Bhoja later than 1400 A. D., as it quotes
Vijñāneśvara and the Madanapārijāta. It was composed
by an assembly of Pandits at the bidding of King Bhoja
of Aśāpura, Son of Bhāramalla . The MS was copied in
Samvat 1695 (i. e. 1638–39 A. D. )"

As Dr. Kane has not identified the kings Bhāramalla and his son Bhoja
it is necessary for me to record the following evidence which throws
some light on the chronology and history of these Kings :--
The Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. V (Bombay, 1880), pages 136-137 gives
us the following information about these Kings of Cutch and their chrono-
logy :-
Rão Khengār I of Cutch -- A. D. 1548–1585.
Rão Bhārmal I -- A. D. 1585–1631.
During his reign the Government of Gujarat passed from
Ahmadabad Kings to the Mughal Emperors. He was one
of the greatest Zamindars of Gujarat. He died in A. D. 1631.
Rão Bhojarāj--A. D. 1631-1645.
Bhārmal was succeeded by Bhojarāj, who ruling till 1645

I have no doubt that Bhojarāja, the reputed author of the work Dharma-
pradipa (MS of A. D. 1638) is identical with Rao Bhojaraj of Cutch ( A. D.
1631-1645). Unfortunately the Bombay Gazetteer gives no information
about the biography of Bhojarāja or his literary interests. It appears,
however, that he had some interest in literature and patronised some
authors. Though the work Dharmapradipa 1 is stated to be the work of
Bhojarāja it was composed by an assembly of pandits as stated by Dr. P.
V. Kane.
The B. O. R. Institute MS No 26 of 1874-75 begins as follows:- -

The foregoing extracts from the beginning and end of the MS of
Dharmapradipa supply us the following information about its author:--
(1) Āsāpurā was possibly the tutelary deity of Bhojarāja, the author
of the Dharmapradipa.
(2) Āsāpurā was identical with the goddess Pārvatī, consort of God
Siva.
(3) King Bhāramalla was the father of King Bhoja. He was deeply
devoted to God Siva and was a patron of poets.
(4) Bhojarāja or King Bhoja was also a patron of poets like his
father.
(5) The work Dharmapradīpa was composed by an assembly of
Pandits gathered from different quarters by the express order of
King Bhoja.
(6) The colophon states that Dharmapradipa was composed by Rao
Bhojarāja ( “राउ श्री भोजराज" ) son of Rao Bhāramalla
(“राउ श्री भारमल्ल”). -
(7) The colophon states that first copy of the Dharmapradipa was
made in Vikrama Samvat 1695 ("शर, अंक, रस, भू") = A. D. 1689.
Great Bhujapura which is evidently the town of Bhuj, the capital of
Cutch, where Rao Bhojaraja was ruling (A. D. 1631-1645). This
was evidently a contemporary copy of the work Dharmapradipa.

Page 156****************************************************************************************
Chronology of Dharmapradīpada
143
The work itself, composed by pandits by the order of Bhojarāja,
can be assigned to the period of about 7/8 years-- A. D. 1631 to
1.639 if the dates of Rao Bhojarāja given by the Bombay Gazetteer
are correct.
(8) The B. O. R. Institute MS of the Dharmapradipa, No. 26 of
1874–75, was copied in Vikrama Samvat 1726 ( A. D. 1670 ) or
Saka 1591 at Bhujanagar (modern Bhuj) by a scribe of the
name Govardhana.
From the foregoing data we can easily conclude that the work Dhar-
mapradipa was composed between A. D. 1631 and 1639 and was subsequen-
tly copied in the years A. D. 1639 and 1670 at Bhujapura or Bhujanagara
(= modern Bhuja ) the capital of Cutch in Kathiawar. Both the
Kings of Cutch viz. Bhāramalla and his son Bhojarāja were patrons of
learned men. Works and authors mentioned in the MS of Dharmapradīpa
are as follows:

It is clear from the extracts given above that the Bhojavyākaraña
is a work on grammar composed by Vinayasāgara, pupil of Kalyāṇasāgara,
by the order of king Bhojarāja son of Bhāramalla.
I have no doubt that the Bhojarāja son of Bhāramalla mentioned by
Vinayasāgara as his patron king is identical with Bhojarāja the reputed
author of the Dharmapradīpa composed between A. D. 1631 and 1638 as
I have shown above.

Dr. Belvalkar observes -
“ Bhojavyākaraña by Vinayasundara — written for the benefit of a King Bhoja, son of
Bhāramalla. This work like the above, is metrical in form, following the usual topical
arrangement."
Vinayasāgara is the author of this work and not Vinayasundara as stated by
Dr. Belvalkar.

stated by Vinayasāgara. As this king ruled between A. D. 1631 and 1645
we may fix up the date of the Bhojavyākarana between A. D. 1631 and
1645.
Prof. H. D. Velankar records the following MSS of the Bhojavyāka-
rana in his Jinaratnakos'a (B. O. R. Institute, Poona, 1944):-
Page 299--"775521TOT (Gram 2000) by faatart of Añcala Gaccha.
BO. p. 43; Buh. II, No. 82 ; CC I. p. 418. JB. 161 ; JG p.
298 ; Limdi No 1187.”
On p. 247 of the Jinaratnakośa Velankar records a work called "1814
HEFFIA " by Kalyāṇasāgarasūri of the Añcala Gaccha. Most probably this
Kalyānasāgara is identical with Kalyānasāgara, the guru of Vinayasāgara
who composed the Bhojavyākaraņa between A. D. 1631 and 1645.
The data recorded in this paper will, I hope, be found useful in fixing
the chronology of any other works of Bhojarāja, Vinayasāgara and Kalyā-
nasāgara, if they come to light hereafter. At any rate I have fixed up
within narrow limits the dates of the Dharmapradipa and the Bhojavyāka-
rana, which were left undecided by other scholars.
The Prasastisamgraha (ed. by A. M. Shah, Ahmedabad ), Part II
contains the following dated praśastis in which Kalyānasāgara is men.

Page 187 - MS of Samvat 1678 (= A. D. 1622 )- it was pre.
sented to कल्याणसागरसूरीश्वर ( mentioned as " अंचलगच्छाधि-

It will be seen from the above dated praśastis that Kalyāṇasāgara,
the guru of Vinayasāgara, the author of Bhojavyākarana, was living
between A. D. 1622 and 1661.
Part II of the Prasastisamgraha contains the following prasastis
mentioning fazan :-

Vinayasāgara mentioned in the above praśastis dated A. D. 1611,
1620 and 1627 was contemporary of Kalyānasāgara, who was living bet-
ween A. D. 1622 and 1661. It is possible to suggest that this Vinayasāgara
is identical with Vinayasāgara, the pupil of Kalyāṇasāgara, who com-
posed the Bhojavyākarana between A. D. 1691 and 1645. More definite
evidence is, however, required to prove the identity of Vinayasāgara of
the prasastis with his namesake, the author of the Bhojavyākaraña. .

17. Authorship and Antiquity of a Stanza with
Paleographic Imagery in the Text Of the
Mahimnastotra *
Having published a paper on the History of Ink-manufacture in
India I developed some interest in the literary references about writing
materials frequently found in Sanskrit sources. While reading the popular
hymn to God Siva called the Mahimnastotra, which is recited by some
devout people every day, I was much charmed by the following stanza
which contains in the form of sublime imagery references to writing
materials viz. (1) ink, (2) pen and (3) palm-leaf or birch-bark and (4)
ink-pot :-
" असितगिरिसमं स्यात्कज़लं सिन्धुपात्रे
सुरतरुवरशाखा लेखनी पत्रमुर्वी।
लिखति यदि गृहीत्वा शारदा सर्वकालम्
तदपि तव गुणानां ईश पारं न याति ॥"
(O God Śiva! even though the Goddess of Learning (Sāradā) continues
recording perpetually your good qualities on the leaf in the form of the
earth with pen in the form of the branch of the heavenly tree and ink
made of a mountain of black soot dissolved in the ink-pot in the form of
the river Indus, she will not be able to exhaust all your qualities.)
In view of the sublime imagery of paleographic interest contained
in the above stanza I began to investigate the antiquity and authorship
of this stanza. In the first instance I wanted to satisfy myself that this stanza
is a genuine part of the Mahimnastotra itself. While my investigation was
going on I happened to read the edition of Aparokşānubhava ( with Jaya-
rāmasvāmi Vadgaonkar's metrical commentary in Marathi ) by V. L.
Bhave, Thana, 1905. This edition contains the Sanskrit text (in verse ) of
the Aparokşānubhava ( also called Aparokşānubhūti), the authorship of
which is ascribed to Samkarācārya ( 8th century A. D.). The Marathi com.
mentary was composed by Jayarāmasvāmi, who flourished between A. D.
1599 and 1672 ( vide p. 396 of Madhyayugina Caritrakośa by S. Chitrav
Shastri, Poona, 1937).
Jayarāmasyāmi (=JS) has divided his Marathi commentary in 12
Prakaranas. The 11th Prakarana ends as follows:--

This occurrance of the stanza " असितगिरिसमं” from the popular text of
the Mahimnastotra in the text of the Aparokşānubhava came to me as a
surprise but the commentary of this stanza bs JS ( A.D. 1599-1672)
pleased me as it proved the following points connected with my inquiry :-
(1) JS (A.D. 1599–1672) had before him a MS of Aparokşānubhava
with the stanza “ असितगिरिसमं" as part of the text.
(2) This stanza was in existence about A.D. 1600 irrespective of the
question of its authorship.
With regard to the authorship of the stanza we have now to answer the
following questions:--
. (1) Does this stanza form a genuine part of the Mahimnastotra? or
(2) Does it form part of the Aparokşānubhava of Samkarācārya ? These
questions can be answered by examining all known MSS and printed
editions of the Mahimnastotra and the Aparokşānubhūti (ºbhava). To begin
with I shall record below the results of my examination of the material
available to me :--

(I) Mahimnastotra-The Govt. MSS Library at the B.O. R. Institute
possesses the following MSS of the Stotra:-
(1) Text with commentary by Krsna-nrpa --No. 742 of 1886-92.
-The stanza "असितगिरिसम" is given on folio 14bas No. 32.
Stanza No. 33 -"सुरभुजगनरेन्द्रः " is the last stanza of the text.
Soratis The commentary explains only stanzas No. 31 and 33. There is
E no Commentary for Stanza No. 32.
(2) Text with commentary-No. 645 of 1888-84--On folio 14 the
stanza " असितगिरिसमं” is found as No. 32 with the following
commentary :--
. " हे ईश हे स्वामिन् असितगिरिसमं अंजनगिरितुल्यं । कज्जलं स्यात् । व सिंधुपात्रे
यदि सुरतरुवरशाखा लेखनी स्यात्तु । यदि शारदा सरस्वती उर्वी पत्रं गृहीत्वा सर्वकालं

(3) Text with commentary-No. 539 of 1891-95-On folio 17
the stanza ".असितगिरिसमं" appears as the last stanza ( No. 32)
of the text with thə following commentry:-
"हे ईश असितगिरिसमं अंजनगिरितुल्यं कज्जलं स्यात् क सिंधुपात्रे यदि सुरुतरुवर-
शाखा लेखनी स्यात् ॥ यी शारदा सरस्वती उर्वी पत्रं गृहीत्वा सार्वकालं लिखति ॥ तदपि
तव गुणानां पारं न याति ॥ ३२॥"
This commentary is practically a copy of that in MS No. 645 of
1883-84 recorded above.
(4) Madhusūdana Sarasvati has commented on the Mahimnastotra.
I have examined the following MSS of his commentary:-
No. 175 of 1884-87-dated Saka 1747 (= A.D. 1825)- Copied
at सप्तर्षिपुर ( = Satara ? ). The stanza " असितगिरिसमं" is not found
in this MS. There is also no commentary on it by Madhusūdana
Sarasvati.
No. 75 of A 1879-80 -- Text with commentary. Neither the stanza
" असितगिरिसमं" nor its commentary is found in the MS.
No. 33 of 1883–84 -Text with commentary of Madhusūdana Sara-
syatī. The last three stanzas of the text are the following:-
(१) “ कुसुमदशननामा.............महिन्म: ।। ३२ ॥

एते त्रयः श्लोकाः न सांप्रदायिकत्वेन श्लोकांतर्गताः
तथा सुगमाश्चेति उपेक्षिताः इति शुभं”
It will be seen from the above extract that the verse“ safe
afata: ” is found in this MS among verses which are not
accompanied with the comment of Madhusūdana Sarasvatī.
The attempt of the copyist to explain away the non-inclusion
of these four verses in the body of the text of the Stotra
accompanied with the commentary by his own endorsements
viz. (1) "pizza: etc. " and ( 2 )" gà 79: 1tar: etc.” is
futile and confirms our suspicion about their genuineness.
No. 159 of 1881–82—Text with commentary of Madhusūdana
Sarasvatī. The last stanza of the text is— " a ga ( Tata ?)
AFAI ......AfEFH ” followed by the endorsement "spai 21*:
Fatajatta: grazalà a hé” but without commentary. The
stanza “sfaafiniai ” is absent in this MS so also any
commentary on it is not traceable.
No. 206 of 1902-07--Text with commentary of Madhusūdana
Sarasvatī. The MS is dated Saka 1726 (= A.D. 1814 )—
The last stanza of the text is the same as in MS No. 159 of
A 1881-82. The endorsement following the stanza is also the
same as in MS No. 159 of A 1881-82. The stanza “stfeafitft.
FÅ ” and its commentary are absent in the MS.
The absence of Madhusudana Sarasvati's commentary on the stanza
“ sfaafiliai ” in the above four MSS leads me to believe that the text
of the Mahimnastotra known to him as genuine did not contain this stanza.
( II ) Aparokşānubhava ascribed to Šamkarācārya.
With a view to seeing if the stanza " staafufiah" of the Mahimnasto-
tra forms parts the Aparokşānubhava ( or ºbhūti ) I have to record below
the result of my examination of the following MSS of this work in the
Government MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute:-
(1) MS No. 246 of 1892-95—Text with the Comm. of Vidyāraṇya (c.
A.D. 1350 ) --Contains 147 verses of the text.
(2) MS No. 111 of 1902-07--Text with Comm. of Vidyāraṇya --144
stanzas only of the text plus 3 extra stanzas.
( 3 ) MS No. 368 of A 1881-82 — Commentary called fazlafaatfeat by
Bālagopāla on 144 stanzas of the text.

which refers to the work "gouetq " ( folio 27 )--142 stanzas.

(12) MS No. 626 of Vis I -- Text with the comm. (faqtot ) of
"facetiçangaT" --144 stanzas -- MS dated Šaka 1685
( = A. D. 1763)- The commentator refers to god Vithobā of
Pandharpur (Tata ) on the last folio 148.
None of the above MSS of the text of the Aparokşānubhūti and the
commentaries on it by Vidyāraṇya (c. A. D. 1350) and others contain either
the text or commentary of the stanza of the Mahimnastotra viz. tiga tah
etc. I am, therefore, inclined to believe that this stanza did not form part
of the Aparokşānubhūti, though Jayarāmasyāmī (A. D. 1599–1672 ) had
before him a MS of the Aparokşānubhūti with this stanza incorporated
into it as he comments in Marāthī verse on this stanza considering it as
genuine part of the text. 1
In the light of evidence recorded so far about the textual history
of the stanza in the popular ſivamahimnastotra viz. "TaTITAH ......
a difa” the following inferences can be tentatively drawn :-
(1) This stanza is possibly an interpolation in the text of the
Śivamahimnastotra.
(2) This stanza is also an interpolation in the text of the Apa-
rokşānubhūti available to Jayarāmasvāmī ( A. D. 1599-1672)
for his Marathi commentary in Ovi metre.
1. I have not examined all the printed editions of the Aparok şānubhūti. The following
editions examined by me do not contain the Stanza “ Bifuafifra ” etc. or its
commentary:
(i) Samkarācārya's Miscellaneous Works, Vol. II, Mysore, 1898-pp. 1-57 - Text
with Vidyāraṇya's Commentary,

Litho Press),

(3) The authorship and the exact date of the composition of this
5 stanza is so far unknown but it was in existence between A. D.
1599 and 1672, as Jayarāmasyāmī comments on it.
(4) Perhaps the stanza formed part of some other Stotra or was
a stray Subhāṣita available for indiscriminate insertion in any
text according to the caprice of a copyist or a devotee, who was
charmed by the beauty of imagery contained in the stanza.
(5) This stanza has a clear antiquity of more than 350 years.
I await more documentary evidence for or against the inferences
tentatively drawn by me on the basis of the data recorded in this paper.

18. Studies in the History Of Dietetics - References to
"Avaranna” in the Dharmasutras Of
Baudhayana and Apastamba And The Grhyasutra Of
Apastamba-( BETWEEN B. C. 500 AND A. D. 500 ) *
In my paper on " Varānna " and its history from the 7th century
A.D. up to 1800 A.D. I tried to establish the following equation :-
वरान mentioned by
अवरान mentioned in अष्टांगसंग्रह
the Jain author of
and in अष्टांगहृदय
(7th Cent. A.D.) )
(8th or 9th Century A.D.)
şagia mentioned by the Marathi writers, Ekanātha
( A.D. 1533-1599 ), by Mukteśvara (c.A.D. 1599
-1649), by Rāmadása ( A.D. 1608-1682). -
= apur mentioned in tarafta (Marathi) of C.A.D.
1250, in Fæfaceta (Marathi) of c.A.D. 1450, in
Moropant's works ( A.D. 1729–1794 ).
I further pointed out that the term “ gati-a ” of the Aştāngasamgraha
(C.A.D. 625 ) has been explained by Indu in his commentary ( between
C.A.D. 700 and 900 ) as “face-AF1-7-a" i.e. food prepared from split
grain or pulse. Subsequent commentators like Aruņadatta ( A.D. 1220 )
and Hemādri ( A. D. 1260 ) support Indu's explanation and clarify it by
giving examples. According to Aruņadatta the statia was made of ATT
and other grains evidently in the form of pulse or "faça" 1 which Dallaņa
(C. A. D. 1100) explains as " TH177-8qya:.”
Since the publication of my paper I was in search of the usages of
the term "atia" in sources earlier than A. D. 600 to enable me to learn
the antiquity of this term in Indian dietetic terminology current before
A.D. 600. Fortunately I have been able to trace the following usages of
"atta" much earlier than I expected in non-medical 2 works :-
* Poona Orientalist, Vol. XII (1948) pp. 1-9.
1. Carakasamhitā ( N. S. Press, 1941, pp. 456-457, FaceFYT VII, 137) mentions
the term faças (“ga: 919: HTETT Grau feyes harraçoiarą") which is explained by
Cakrapāņidatta ( C. 1060 A.D. ) as follows:
“ मसूरविदलानामिति निस्तुषमसूराणां, न तु मसूरविदला अत्र श्यामाः उक्तं हि जतूकरें
gros "haha çotuse." şía."
2. I record below some references to the terms "faça" and "aa" in view of Indu's
equation of Baia with "fegy-JR-37214."

"पाणिग्रहणादि गृह्यं परिचरेत् स्वयं परन्यपि वा पुत्रः कुमार्यन्तेवासी वा ॥ १॥"
mentions “ अवरान्न" along with क्षार, लवण, as will be seen from the follow-

(ii) K. M, Vaidya in his अष्टांगहृदयकोष (Trichur, 1936, p. 32 ) explains “ अवरान"
of अष्टांगहृदय (सूत्र० ८) as " विदलान्नम्" which he specifies by the following verses :-
“ यवगोधूमचणका माषो मुद्गाढको तथा । ।
मकुष्टकः कुलत्थश्च मसूरस्त्रिपुटस्तथा ।
निष्पावकः कलायश्च विदलान्न प्रकीर्तितम् ।।"
He further quotes Bhāvamiéra ( 0. A, D. 1550 ) :-
“शमिजाः शिंबिजाः शिंबीभवाः सूप्याश्च वैदलाः "
and ( on p. 286 ) he equates " दलम्' of अष्टांगहृदय (सूत्र २५ ) with दाली ( Marathi डाळ)
and quotes नृसिंह:-
" स्फोटस्तु चणकादीनां दाली तु परिकीर्तिता” 0

The quotation " स्त्रियानुपेतेन ......परिचक्षते" has been traced by me in the
.आपस्तम्बगृह्यसूत्र (Patala III, Khanda 8, Sutra 3) edited by Cinnaswami
Sastri, Kashi Sanskrit Series, Benares, 1928, p. 114, where it occurs as
follows with its explanation by the commentators Haradatta and Sudar-
sanācārya :-
- " स्त्रियानुपेतेन क्षारलवणावरानसंसृष्टस्य च होमं परिचक्षते ॥३॥"
Haradatta explains :-
___" पाकयज्ञाधिकारे सर्वत्रायं प्रतिषेधः श्राद्धादिषु अपि अवरामानि कोशीधान्यानि माषा-
दीनि कृष्णधान्यानि चणककोद्रवादीनि परिचक्षते वर्जयन्ति शिष्टाः."
__Apastamba prohibits the use of क्षार, लवण and अवरान in a homa to be
performed by a house-holder. According to Haradatta (G.A.D. 1100 accord.
ing to Madhyayugina Caritrakosa, Poona, 1937, p. 820) the term "अवराम"
'means “कोशी धान्य" (seeds produced in pod or legume) like माष etc. and
"कृष्ण धान्य" (black or inferior grain) like चणक, कोद्रव etc. I believe this
explanation of “अवरान" by Haradatta is in agreement with the explanation
of Indu who calls it "विदल-सस्य-अन्न" i.e. food prepared from split grain or
pulse. As a matter of fact we prepare in our cookery वरान or वरण 1 of the
pulses of माष, चणक D. Sudarsanācārya2 explains the Sūtra of Apastamba
referred to above as follows:

1. Prof. K. P. Kulkarni in his Vyutpattikoša ( 1947, p. 642 ) makes the following ontry
about वरण:-
" वरण- न. शिजविलेल्या डाळीचा पदार्थ. A dish of pulse.
सं. वर + अन्न. मूळ वरण शब्दाचे संस्कृतीकरण नंतर झाले असावें."
Prof. Kulkarni's statement that the original word qiu may have been later Sanskritised is
not borne out by the history:of this word and its usages in different forms like अवरान्न, वरात्र
and qtul as recorded in this paper and the previous one on this subject. From 37afia the word
वरान्न was derived and from वरान्न, the Marathi वरण,
2. The date of Sudarsanācārya has not been exactly determined. According to my evidence
he is later than A.D. 1800 and earlier than A.D. 1600. He is later than Haradatta, whom he
quotes and refutes, and earlier than Kamalākarabhatta, the author of Nirnayasindhu, (A.D.

Sudarsanācārya practically repeats the explanation of "aria" given by
Haradatta, whom he quotes and criticizes at times in his commentary as
observed by the Editor in his Introduction, p. 7. The term " कोशधान्य" of
Sudarsanācārya appears to be identical with " कोशीधान्य" of Haradatta.
It is clear from the explanations of these commentators, who are later than
about A. D. 1100 that the term " अवरान" means pulse-grains used in
cookery.mobe .icence
Be In continuing his comment on Sūtra 3 referred to above Sudarsanā-
cārya refers to a passage in आपस्तम्ब-धर्मसूत्र which refers to " अवरान" as
follows:-
" यत्तु धर्मशास्त्रे 'न क्षारलवणहोमो विद्यते । तथावरान्नसंसृष्टस्य च' (आपस्तम्ब-धर्म-
सूत्र २-१५-१२, १३) इति etc."
The Sūtras of Āpastamba quoted by Sudarsanācārya in his comment are
identical with the following Sūtras in Bühler's Edition of Āpastamba-
Dharmasutra ( B. S. Series, Poona, 1932):- )
II, 6, 15,-Sutras 14 and 15-
"न क्षारलवणहोमी विद्यते ॥ १४ ॥
तथावरान्नसँसृष्टस्य च ॥ १५॥"
On p. 179 we get the following extracts from Haradatta's commentary
regarding the meanings of "क्षार" and "अवरान" :-
"१४. यद्यद् भक्ष्यमाणं पश्यतो लालोत्पद्यते तत् क्षारम् ।।
१५. अवरान्नं कुलत्थादि तत्संसृष्टान्नस्य होमो न विद्यते ॥”
This explanation of Haradatta about “ अवरान " agrees with his explana-
tion of this term occurring in आपस्तम्ब-गृह्यसूत्र as we have seen above...]
It will thus be seen that through the favour of Haradatta I have
been able to trace the term “ अवरान्न” in the (1) आपस्तम्ब-गृह्यसूत्र and (2)
आपस्तम्ब-धर्मसूत्र as well. These usages of the term “ अवरान्न" are further
corroborated by the बोधायनधर्मसूत्र ( Mysore, 1907) Prasna IV, Chap. 7,
Sūtra 7 as follows:

तैलक्षारलवणावरान्नवर्जेषु यच्चान्यदप्येवं युक्तं द्वादशाहं द्वादश द्वादश प्राणायामान धारयेत् ॥७॥"
Govindasyāmin in his commentary on the above Satra of Bodhāyana
does not explain the term " अवरान." He merely states " अपण्यानि अश्वादीनि
Ayniqi affarfar I"
The foregoing reference to "satia" in the Bodhāyana-Dharma-Sutra
is very important for my present inquiry as Prof. Kane 1 has fixed up the
date of this work between B. C. 500 and 200. If this date is correct, the
history of “ STATE”, which I have identified with Sanskrit "arial" and
Marathi " apo " can be easily taken back to o.B.C. 500 i.e. about 1000
years earlier than Vāgbhata I, who mentions it in his Astānga-Samgraha
(C.A.D. 625). Bühler in his Introduction to the Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra
(p. xi) refers to the "close agreement of the Hiranya keśa-Dharmasūtra
with that of the Apastambīyas." He further states that the foundation of
the Hiraṇyakeśa school is earlier than Fleet's Pallava Inscription No. XV
(Indian Antiquary, V, p. 153 ) which belongs to the "end of the 5th century
A. D." and which mentions a donee “gruzohet plegaTT.". He, therefore,
asserts positively " that the readings of आपस्तम्बधर्मसूत्र, found in the हैरण्य-
hat version are at least fourteen hundred years old. Probably however, the
Hiranyakeśa school "dates from much earlier times."
The Suśrutasamhitā ( N. S. Press, Bombay, 1938, p. 250 ) mentions
“ Tatia” in Satrasthāna, Chap. 46, Verse 491, which reads as follows:-
"a QataÀTTİ TAFT cial-
शाकावरान्नभूयिष्टमम्लं च न समाचरेत् ॥ ४९१ ॥"
Dallana ( 0. A. D. 1100 ) explains :-

This is the earliest reference 2 to "Sara" I have found in medical
works. I give below a chronological table for the references to TT, AUT
and agut so far discovered by me and recorded in my present and
previous paper on the subject :-
1. Vide History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. I (B. O. R. Institute, Poona, 1930 ).
2. The reference to " 37agia” in the Astānga-Samgraha is an echo of Suśrutasamhita
reference. The Aştāṇga-Samgraha refers to "37937" as follows in Chap. 10 of Sūtrasthāna:-

वर्णतः स्वादुता ( स्वादतः ) गन्धान्मार्दवाल्लाघवादपि ॥ ६४ ॥
एवं विदलपाकस्य सम्यसिद्धिरुदाहृता।"
In this extract we get a beautiful detailed description of the prepara-
tion of apn. Someśvara tells us how the different kinds of pulse-grains
should be ground in a घरट्ट and split in a यन्त्रावर्त and unhusked by a शूपेक
and then cooked with the addition of हिंगुतोय, रजनीचूर्ण ( for colouring, वर्णार्थ )
and सैन्धव. This process current about 800 years ago has practically remain-
ed unchanged upto the present day.
I hope some scholars interested in the history of Indian dietetics
would throw some more light on the history of Varana, which I have
tried to clarify so far on the strength of Sanskrit and Marathi sources
available to me.
स्म 1. Tryambaka Narayana Ma te, a Citpavan Brahmin, refers to Varana prepared from
मुद्ग ( Marathi मूग) and आढकी ( Marathi तूर ) in his Dharmasastra work called the आचारेन्दु
( Anandāframa, Poona, 1909, p. 309 ) as follows:-
" अथ सूपादिगुणा उच्यन्ते-
विशेषान्मुद्गकुल्माषो गुरु रुच्यो विबन्धकृत्
वातलः श्लेष्मपित्तन्नः प्रमेहगलरोगिणः । मुगाचे वरण ।
विशेषादाढकीसूपः स्वादु विष्टम्भकृद् गुरुः । तुरीचे वरण ॥"
He also refers to "वरणांतील मुट्की ":-
“ सूपान्नविकृता भक्ष्या वातला रूक्षशीतलाः।।
सकटुस्नेहलवणान्भक्षयेदल्पशस्तु तान् । वरणांतील मुटकीं ॥" कोपन
Other articles of diet mentioned by this author are :-
जोंधळ्याच्या लाह्या, गव्हाच्या लाह्या, पोहे (पृथुक) (p. 300)-पुऱ्या, मांडे, मोदक, रोट्या,
गोधूमचूर्णरोट, पुरणाचे कानवले, वडे, फळे or पातकानवले (!), घार्गे, क्षीरापूपाः (p. 301)-

19. An Echo of the Siege of Jinji in a Sanskrit
Grammatical Work *
(Between A, D. 1690 and 1710)
Varadarāja, a pupil of Bhattoji Dīkşita 1 lived between o. A. D.
1600 and 1660. 2 He composed a Sanskrit conversational grammar called
the Girvānapadamañjari 3 in which conversation in Sanskrit on the daily
life of a Benares Brahmin from morning to night is recorded in a simple
but anausing style to enable junior students of Sanskrit to pick up the
language quickly without frightening them with dry grammatical forms.
The only imitation of the Gīrvāṇapadamañjarī of Varadarāja, so far as I
know, is the Girvānapadamañjarī of Dhundirāja which is called italorar-
FAST at the beginning of the work.4 As this work appears to be an imitation
of Varadarāja's work of the same name it is evidently later than about
A. D. 1650. The evidence recorded in this paper tends to shift its date later
than A. D. 1700 or so.
S The Girvānapadamañjari (Ms No. 345 of 1892–95) informs us in
its five preliminary verses that it was composed by Dhuņdirāja Kavi,
resident of Benares. It further states the object of the work viz. to provide
a sort of conversational grammar to the students of Sanskrit. The subject
of conversation, which fills the entire work, consists of all the doings of a
Brahmin house holder of Benares from morn till eve. Accordingly the
work begins with the early rising of the Brahmin. After some conversation
with his wife the Brahmin proceeds for his daily bath to the Manikarnikā
Ghāt on the bank of the river Ganges, but before he leaves his house he
rebukes his indolent son still rolling in his bed. The son gets up and
receives his father's instructions to proceed to the market for some purch.
ases to be made in connection with the dinner to be given to Brahmins
at his house at noon. The Brahmin then goes to the Maạikarņikā Ghāt,
recites the usual Mantras and finishes his bath in the Ganges. He then

was the dwelling place of Benares Sanyāsins. There were many Sanyāsins
in this Matha, among whom the Brahmin noticed an old corpulent Sanyā.
sin. Bowing low he approached this Sanyāsin and invited him cordially
for dinner that noon. The Sanyāsin made inquiries about the caste of his
host. The Brahmin replied that he was a Mahārāstra (Brahmin). There.
upon the Sanyāsin accompanied the Brahmin to his house. The host then
washed the feet of the Sanyāsin, with his own hands and seated him on a
special seat. The Sanyāsin as also other Brahmins assembled were then
served with sumptuous food. At the conclusion of the dinner the host gave
a handful of cloves to the Sanyāsin, while he distributed Tāmbula and
Dakşiņā to other guests, who departed with their blessings for the host.
The Sanyāsin then made some inquiries about the members of the host's
family, including the women-folk. He also inquired about the studies
conducted by the host in Bengal ( Gaudadeśa ) and at Benares. Then
followed an interesting discourse on certain customs which were consider.
ed evil customs ( Durācāras ) in different regions of India, for instance
the southern custom of marrying the daughter of maternal uncle, the
fish-eating by Brahmins of Bengal and the like. There was also some
discussion between the host and the Sanyāsin on many matters of mutual
interest. Just before the Sanyāsin took leave of his host, the host requested
him to give him some particulars about his life as a householder. The
Sanyāsin requested his host not to raise this question as it will bring to
him memories of his past glory, which were very painful. As the host,
however, was very eager to know something of this past glory the Sanyā.

The substance of the above interesting extract is as follows:-
_The Sanyasin in his life of a house-holder belonged to चंजी or बीजापूर
village in the Karnātak. The Emperor of Delhi had a minister named
Āsatkhan. His son Zulfikar Khan started on a military expedition and
came to Karnatak. At this time this (Sanyasin) Brahmin was in his
company for several days with 2000 horses, 10000 servants, 40 elephants
and many camels and chariots. He had in his house four palanquins and
several coolies and carts. He had in his house sixteen maid servants of
unparalleled beauty who were extremely devoted to his service. His own
wife was not so beautiful as these maid-servants. One of them was extre-
mely lovely and for her he developed a special liking. She was always by
his side, possessing, as she did, a sweet voice coupled with a proficiency in
singing and dancing. She was a veritable celestial damsel. Even though he
had become a Sanyāsin a recollection of this damsel unsettled his mind as
it was no more than a dream.
Formerly in his house hundreds of Brahmins were fed. He also fed
many beggars and others who needed food. During the days of his power
no person who wanted anything from him, went away disappointed as he
granted the requests of every one, who approached him with any object in
view. Such was the glory of the householder of old but now it looked
like a dream and brought a very painful memory.

6 I have not noted all the variants but only important ones. Though the text is incorrect,
the sense can be easily gathered as the text is written in the Pancatantra prose style to a certain
extent. The method of teaching Sanskrit composition as illustrated by the works of Varadarāja
and his imitator Dhuậdirāja about 250 years ago has a modernistic touch. It remains to be
discovered if our ancient teachers of Sanskrit adopted similar methods to create some interest
among their students in the manner of these works.

On being questioned as to how and why all this glory of the house-
holder disappeared, the Sanyāsin stated as follows :-
While the house-holder was absorbed in enjoyment in the company
of young women he received orders from his lord ( Zulfikar Khan). No
attention was paid to these orders, so he sent a messenger a second time.
Even then he did not leave the house, being absorbed in the enjoyment of
the highest pleasure derived from his addiction to the beauty ( of these
young women ). Zulfikar Khan sent a messenger for the third time and
still this grandee paid no heed to his orders. This conduct enraged his
master, who immediately despatched his commander with 4000 horsemen.
All the followers of this grandee were unprepared and consequently with.
in a very short time all the property of the grandee was looted and the
grandee himself was hand-cuffed and brought before his master ( Zulfikar
Khan ) who severely scolded the grandee and kept him in confinement for
four months. Later he was released. Since the day of his release the
grandee was stung with remorse. He then went to Kuruksetra ( Delhi ),
abandoning his family etc., and there practised penance for some days. He
then became a Sanyāsin and then went to Benares. Twelve years had elaps.
ed since he became Sanyāsin. After wandering to different holy places
(tīrthas ) he resorted to Benares, where he had completed a four
months' stay when his host 1 met him ( and invited him for dinner ). The
Sanyāsin expressed his resolve to devote himself to Manikarnikā.
The host, after hearing this story of the early life of the Sanyāsin,
expressed his admiration for the step taken by the Sanyāsin because it
is said :-
“On this globe there is no parallel to the god Viśveśvara, his abode
Benares and its holy place Manikarnikā.".
I have now to make the following remarks on the Story of the Brah.

shment, appears to me to be a true historical story. The story was too vivid
to be idealised by our author by dropping its reference to Asatkhan and
1 This host appears to me to be identical with Dhuņdirāja himself, the author of the
Girvanapadamañjari. I have suggested in the sequel that this romantic story of the early life of
the Sanyāsin is a true story inserted by our author in his work for literary embellishment. No
such story appears in the Girvāṇapadamafijari of Varadarāja. Dhundirāja though an imitator
of Varadarāja, is certainly original in inserting this romantic story with a tragic touch in his
own work and thus relieving the monotony of his imitation.

his son Zulfikar Khan and their military expedition (fèfiqat) to Karnatak
on behalf of the Mogul Emperor ( Aurangzeb ) at Delki.
2. Our Brahmin grandee was obviously in the employ of Zulfikar
Khan or at least he paid his allegiance to this general and hence the
latter is aptly called Prabhu or overlord of the former in the story
before us.
3. The identification of this Brahmin grandee of Karnatak and his
relation to Zulfikar Khan has become difficult as the name of the grandee
is not recorded in the story and further while one Ms makes him a
resident of चंजी1 another Ms variant makes him a resident of बीजापुर.
The third Ms drops any reference to these villages.
au 4. Asatkhana mentioned as the minister of the Delhi Emperor and
his son Zulfikar Khans are historical personages.
5. I am of opinion that the Karnatak Digvijaya (Expedition to
Karnataka ) by Zulfikar Khan, son of Asatkhan, is identical with his cele-
brated siege of Jinji ( 1690--1698 A. D. ). It was a long drawn-out siege
by the forces of Aurangzeb lasting for seven years or so. Rajaram Chatra-
pati, the second son of Shivaji the Great, ruled at Gingee or Jinji, where
he was besieged by the Mogul forces under Zulfikar Khan for seven
years and from which he finally escaped. This siege had captured the
imagination of the people of the Maharashtra and the Karnatak so much
1 Canji = modern Gingee, a once celebrated hill fortress in South Arcot, 50 miles north
east of Cuddalore and 35 miles north west from Pondicherry and at one time the seat of a
Maratha Principality. It is spelt severally as Gingie, Jinjee, Chengi, Chenjie ( Vide p. 376, of
Hobson-Jobson, 1903, by Yule and Burnell ). Yule observes:—"Ginji or Jinjee, properly Chenji.
[Shenji, and this from Tamil Shingi, Skt. Sringi, a "hill" Usages :- 1616 A. D.
(Ginja); A. D. 1675 ( Chengie ); A. D. 1680 ( Chengy); A. D. 1752 Gingee ].
2. He is identical with Asad Khan, the prime-minister of Aurangzeb. He had gone to
Jinjee to help his son Zulfikar Khan ( Vide p. 76 of Madhyayugina Caritrakośa ). Beale in his
Oriental Biographical Dictionary ( London, 1894, p. 80 ) states that Asad Khan was
descended from an illustrious family of Turkmans. His former name was Ibrahim. He was
made second Bakshi by Shah Jahan. He held this office till 1671 A. D. Later he was made
Wazir by Aurangzeb. Bahadur Shah made him Wakil Mutlaq ( an office superior to Wazir )
and his son Ismail was made chief paymaster ( Mir Bakshi ) with the title “Umra Zulfikar
Khan". Farrukshiar, however, disgraced him and his son was put to death. He died 90 years
old in A. D. 1717.
3. He is identical with Zulfikar Khan, the son of Asad Khan referred to above ( A. D.
1657–1712 ). He laid siege to the fort of Jinji for 6/7 years ( A. D. 1691–97 ) but it was a
complete failure. Hs also invaded Tanjore and Trichinopoly. Farrukshiar put him to death in
A. D. 1712 ( Vide p. 417 of Madhyayugina Caritrakośa ) Beal ( 0. B. Dict. ) p. 430, does not
refer to the Siege of Jinji laid by Zulfikar Khan. According to Vincent Smith (p. 444 of Oxford
History of India. 1928 ) " Zulfikar Khan deliberately played with the siege of Jinji and purpo-
sely allowed Rajaram to escape.”

in those days that it found reflection in contemporary documents and
literature.1 It is no wonder, therefore, that it should capture the imagina-
tion and busy pen of modern historians like Sir Jadunath Sarkar,
Rao Bahadur G. S. Sardesai, Rao Bahadur C. S. Srinivasachari and
others. In particular Rao Bahadur Srinivasachari's monumental volume
on the “ History of Gingee and its rulers " ( Annamalai University Series
No. 2) recently published reveals that this history has besieged its
learned author for about 32 years since he first brought out an account
of it in 1912 and I wonder, if Rao Bahadur Srinivasachari has yet
succeeded in making his escape from this Gingee, like Rajaram of old.
Chapter VII of this delightful volume is devoted to the Mughal Siege and
and Capture of Gingee” (pp. 286–350 ) 1690-1698 A. D. Some facts
from this chapter muy be noted below to enable us to understand the
historical background of the reference to the Karnataka Digvijaya of
Zulfikar Khan in the Girvānapadamañjarī of Dhuậdirāja :-
June 1690--Zulfikar Khan (=Z) who invested Raigad, was despatched
by Aurangzeb to Karnatak to crush the Maratta power at Jinji or
Gingee.
Sept. 1690--Z reacha Gingee.
April 1691--The Mogal army under Z had become powerful and well
provisioned for a serious assault - No decisive success for the im-
perialists in 1691.
December 1691--Asad Khan, the father of Z, and Prince Kam Baksh reach
Gingee under orders of Aurangzeb.
1692 -- The procrastination of Z in his operations.
1693 -- Z and his father in great straits - Emperor displeased with Asad
Khan.
1694 -- Asad Khan restored to King's favour according to a letter from
1 See the Rājārāma Carita by Keśava Paņdita ( ed. by V. S. Bendre, Poona) which
describes in Sanskrit verses the march of Rajarama Chatrapati to Jinji. Dr. 8. M. H. Nainar
published in 1939 a Tamil Mono-Drama called “Seyda-K-Kadi Nondi-Natakam " ( Annals of
Oriental Research, Madras University, Vol. IV, Part I). The author of the drama appears to have
been a convert to Islam. The Drama is a contemporary picture of the siege of Jinji and is full of
references to the Mogal commanders under Zulfikar Khan and Maratha commanders under
Rajaram. The Sāhendravilāsa Kāvya by Śridhara Venkatesa refers to the siege of Jinji (Vide p.
184 ff of Indian Antiquary, 1904 ). Rajaram received help from the then Raja of Tanjore :-
'बलैर्महाराज भवन्निर्दिष्टेदिल्लीन्द्रसैन्यानि विदारितानि ।
स राजरामश्च तथाभिगुप्तस्तदम्चति त्वां महती यशः श्रीः ॥'
Vide Annals ( B. O. R. Institute ) Vol. XX, pp. 235 ff - my article on some verses by
Kelava Pandita, the author of राजारामचरित.

• Studies in Indian Literary History
Fort St. George -- Z renews siege operations, which were regarded as
a mere show to deceive the Emperor.
1695--An uneventful year. Z receives 3 lacs of rupees from the Mogul
Court and captures a few forts from the Marattas. A large Maratta army
under Santaji and Dhanaji Jadhav approached Gingee towards the close
of the year.
1696—Z feels extreme want of money. Z defeats Santaji near Arni.
1697-Z renews attack on Gingee.
1698--Rajaram escapes with four or five thousand Marattas to Vellore
according to a letter from Fort St. George- Capture of Gingee by Z
" between 28th December 1697 and 5th January 1698"-Z renamed
Gingee as “ Nasratgaddah ” after his own title “ Nasrat Jang "- Z
appoints Gussafar Khan as Killedar of Gingee. Zulfikar Khan left the
Karnatak after about a year from the fall of Gingee.
Such in brief is the chronology of the Karnataka Digvijaya of
Zulfikar khan mentioned incidentally in the Girvāṇapadamañjari with-
out any details. It is, therefore, clear that this work was composed
some time after A.D. 1698. As regards the exact date of its composition
I may note here the following facts which might enable us to fix this
date within reasonable limits:-
1. The Brahmin grandee was in the employ of Zulfikar Khan
some time after September 1690 when Z reached Gingee. Perhaps Z
wanted to make use of him against the Marathas under Rajaram in the
Gingee fortress.
2. Perhaps the arrest of this Brahmin grandee took place about
A. D. 1691-92. If this suggestion is accepted we have to suppose that he
migrated to Kuruksetra or Delhi after four months, imprisonment by
Z and subsequent release. We may, therefore, suppose that he wandered
outside Karnatak in Northern India as a Sanyāsin for 12 years as stated
by him between say A. D. 1690 and 1702 and then reached Benares.
3. The grandee was invited for dinner by his Benares host
within 4 months of his stay at Benares in the Matha of the Sanyāsins
say in A. D. 1702–1703.
4. As Dhundirāja records the story of the Brahmin grandee as an
event of fresh occurrence we may not be wrong in presuming that the
Girvānapadamañjari was composed say between A. D. 1702 and 1704.
1. Mr. V. L. Kale of Belgaum has written a historical romance in Marathi called
जिंजीवास' or 'छत्रपति राजाराममहाराज' which describes how the machinations of Aurangzeb
were successfully checkmated by the Marathas under Rajaram. An English translation of the
romance by Mre. Smith was published in 1933.

5. We may, however, tentatively fix the date of this work
between A. D. 1690 and 1710. At any rate this grammatical work is
definitely later than A. D. 1690 when Zulfikar Khan reached Gingee.
Having recorded the historical evidence to explain the story of
the Brahmin grandee of Karnatak as recorded in a work composed
at Benares after A. D. 1690 and possibly before A. D. 1710, I now turn
to the question of deciding the native place of this grandee. In this
connection the following points may be noted :-
1. All the three Mss of the Girvānapadamañjarī before me state
that the native place of the grandee was in Karnatak country (कर्नाटकदेशे).
2. One Ms mentions this native place as 'afaa' another gives us
CatFITTAIH' while the third Ms does not specify the name. In view of
the reference to the maitafefragt of Asat Khan's son Zulfikar Khan under
orders of the Delhi Emperor as made in the work, I am inclined to
believe that our Brahmin grandee belonged to चंजीग्राम and not बीजापूरग्राम.
Zulfikar Khan left for ësit in June 1890 and reached it in September 1690.
There was hardly any time for him to camp at Bijapur ( ataqt of Ms )
and keep this grandee in confinement for 4 months after looting his
property.
3. Rao Bahadur Srinivasachari 1, states that Gingee was called as
follows by different people :-
(i) Badshabad by Bijapur authorities, who held the fort between
A D. 1660 and 1677.
(ii) Chandry or Chindy by Marathas.
Gi (iii) Nasrat Gaddah by the the Moguls after 1698.
(iv) Gingee or Jinji, by the French.
(v) Chingee or Chengy, in early Madras records.
(vi) The fort has retained the name Gingee, the English form of
the Tamil word Senji.
It is clear from the above names of Gingee that ift of the Ms of
the Girvānapadamañjarī is identical with modern Gingee.
4. It is possible to suppose that this Brahmin grandee of Gingee
was a Mahārāstra Brahmin residing on the outskirts of the Gingee fort
or in the Gingee territory about A. D. 1690. He must have joined Zulfi.

identical with Dhuậdirāja himself, the author of the Girvānapadamañjarī.
When this work was being composed the author may have invited
this Sanyāsin for dinner and learned this story of his early life first-hand
from the Sanyāsin. This real story being colourful, romantic and vivid,
the author could not avoid the temptation of pushing it in his work in its
appropriate context.
I have given in the foregoing lines my interpretation of the story of
the Gingee grandee as found in the Girvānapadamañjari of Dhuậdirāja.
This interpretation needs to be verified by scholars like my friend Rao
Bahadur Srinivasachari who have made a close study of contemporary
sources regarding the siege of Gingee ( A. D. 1690-1698 ). Dhundirāja's
work as also Varadarāja's work of the same name ought to be critically
edited and kept before the students of the cultural history of Benares in
the 17th century. I trust, therefore, that the present paper would attract the
attention of scholars to the valuable cultural contents of these works which
give us a peep into the cultural life of the Benares Brahmins in the 17th
century, which produced celebrities like Gāgābhatta, Jagannatha Pandita-
rāja, Kamalākara Bhatta and others.
It appears that Dhuņdirāja the author of the Go. vāņapadamañjari was
a Brahmin of the Madhva sect as will be seen from the following evidence:-
1. The Brahmin Sanyāsin when invited for dinner by his Benares
host inquired-- ben
Està aq #1 al Arfa:'( What is your caste ?) and
The host replied
Fallhat T AEITISTISFA' (My good sir, I am a Mahārāstra Brahmin)
The Sanyāsin said--
'एवं किल । तर्हि माहाराष्ट्राणां गृहे अस्मादीनां भिक्षात्तुं अतीव शस्ता' HD
(If that is so, I very much prefer to have alms in the home of
Mabārāstra Brahmins )
The disguised identity of the Benares host with the author of the
work is too transparent to be concealed.
2. In the discussion on evil customs (durācāras ) of different
provinces the Benares host tells the Sanyāsin as follows :--
'महाराष्ट्रं विना सर्वासु जातिषु कश्चित् कश्चित् दुराचारास्तिष्ठत्येव। महाराष्ट्रेष्वपि ये मध्वाः
वर्तन्ते तेषां दुराचारस्य लवलेशोऽपि न दृश्यते।'
(Among all castes excepting those in Mahārāstra some kind of evil
custom prevails. Even among Mahārāstra people the members of the
Madhva sect have no evil custom whatsoever ).

Page 184****************************************************************************************
An Echo of the Siege of Jinji in a Sanskrit Grammatical Work 171
The Sanyāsin observed :-
'इदं त्वया सत्यं उक्तं मयापि अनुभूतं वर्तते'
( You have spoken the truth. I too have realised this truth. )
The host remarked :-
Farha: at a magyar fest
(If I have not spoken the truth, do you think I have told you a false
thing ?)
The foregoing extracts amply suggest that our author Dhuņờirāja
was a Mahārāştra Brahmin of the Madhva soct.

Hemacandra concludes the above list of different horses ( Bhumi-
kanda, verses 303-309 ) with the remark " खोग्ाहादयः शब्दा देशीप्रायाः ।
व्युत्पत्तिस्त्वेषां वर्णानुपूर्वी निश्चयार्थम् ” ( These names खोङ्गाह and others are for the
most part qaít. Their derivation is based on the different colours of horses
for distinctive purposes). The statement of Hemacandra that these names
for differently coloured horses are " देशीप्रायाः ” shows that he was not
sure that they were definitely gaft words in all cases. It is, however,
clear that these names were current in Heinacandra's time, i.e., in
the 11th century. Let us now see if these names, or at least some

of them are traceable in other Sanskrit texts, not much removed
in point of chronology from Hemacandra's time. In fact in the Section
on the game of Polo called the afhajanielfaata in the encyclopaedic work
ATAHIGA 1 (or efnafoaieffarainfo) composed about A. D. 1130 ( i.e., when
Hemscandra was about 42 years old ) by King Someśvara of the Cālukya
dynasty we find some of these names recorded. In this section the king
is advised to examine the different kinds of horses of different breeds
and colours brought before him by the officer in charge of the horses.
The king was to understand their kinds by the countries they came from.
The names of different countries from which the horses took their
origin are mentioned by Someśvara. He also mentions the distinctive
marks on the body of a horse and classifies the horses according to
colours and castes, which are four in number. He mentions further the
peculiarities of different kinds of horses including those in respect of the
formation of their bodies. Here he describes the queglur and MEATTIE
horses. The speeds of horses are then classified a high, middling and
low. Signs of bad horses are also recorded. The methods of punishing
and breaking raw horses to make them fit for training are enumerated.
When the training is complete these horses were to be used by the king.
The best horse was to be fitted with the best saddle, ornaments, etc. and
used by the king.
Before recording the names of horses according to colour (auf )
Someśvara observes :-

On a comparison of the above list of Someśvara with that of Hema-
candra we find that the following names of horses are common to both
the lists:--
(1)
, (4) JNE, (5) Roz and
, (2) ÈTIE, (3) ites or aft
possibly (6) fasus or i
This is not a mere coincidence. Though Someśvara was ruling in
the Deccan and Hemacandra was living in Gujarat, there was constant
mutual contact of both these provinces. Hemacandra's patron king
Kumārapāla twice invaded Konkon and king Mallikarjuna of the Sīlāhāra
dynasty was killed in one of these invasions.1 It is just possible to suppose
that some of the horse-lore of the Deccan must have migrated to Gujarat
and vice versa as it was of great value to kings engaged in constant
warfare.
Some of the names of horses recorded by Someśvara and Hemacan.
dra in the 11th century are also found in a special treatise on horses called
the Asvavaidyaka2 of Mahāsāmanta Jayadatta, son of Vijayadatta. In the
list of drugs at the end of the edition, which the editor states, have been
mentioned by Jayadatta, I find it has or opium ( on p. 3 ). If this state-
ment is correct I have to observe that this treatise was composed after the
Muslim advent in India as opium is not known to Indian literature prior
to the Muslim advent 3 in the 8th century A. D. Perhaps this treatise was

called the भश्वचिकित्सित by नकुल edited in 1887 by the editor of Jayadatta's
work in the Bibliotheca Indica does not contain the names of horses recor-
ded by Hemacandra, Someśvara and Jayadatta. Chapter 3 of Nakula's
work contains, however, a description of horses according to colours
(वर्ण) with different names but these names are Sanskrit and not “देशीप्रायाः"
as those mentioned by Hemacandra. I record in detail in the following
table the special names of horses according to their colours mentioned
by Jayadatta in his अश्ववैद्यक :-

Some Distinctive Names Of Horses
179
od n I have tried to tabulate the horse-nomenclature in Jayadatta's
gaat as best as I could understand it. This nomenclature is different
from that given in the treatise on horses i by t els which is frequently
referred to by Jayadatta. In Jayadatta's time the old terminology had fallen
into disuse and consequently Jayadatta has recorded the nomenclature
that was current in his time, as such a record had a practical utility.
In fact Jayadatta expresses this object of his nomenclature in the following
Verses: - di ai moigor aidi io sbait adi visodios em sa od ot gaibrados

so ab It will be seen from the three lists of the names of horses according
to colours (aoi ) tabulated by me in this paper that the lists of Jayadatta
and Someśvara ( A. D. 1130 ) are more exhaustive than that of Hema-
candra. These three lists together containing many common names give
us a vivid idea of the horse-lore current say in the 11th and 12th
„centuries. This horse-lore, is definitely connected with the foreign
horse trade with India that was going on in Indian ports after about 800
A. D. as I have shown elsewhere.1 Hemacandra says that this nomen-
clature is "data". I have reason to believe that some of these names
are either Persian or Arabic and they may have come to India along
with Persian, Arabic, Turkish and other foreign breeds of horses that
were imported to India as vouched in detail by Marco Polo's Travels
(A. 1). 1298 ). Marco Polo's •account of the foreign import of horses is
further supported by the following account of the horse-trade at a Malabar
port called kāyal about A. D. 1290 recorded by Dr. S. K. Aiyangar 2. buco
tin Kāyal was a well-sheltered port at the mouth of Tamara parani in the
Gulf of Manar in the south, not far from the far-famed Korkai (Kolkhoi
of the classical geographers ). There was a prominent trade-settlemerit
Sat Kāyal--about A. D. 1290, where an agency was established by an Arab
Chieftain, Maliku-l-Islam Jamalu-d-din ruler of Kis, and later the farmer.
general of Fars. According to Wassaf , about this time as many as 10,000
"horses were imported into Kāyal and other ports of India of which 1400
were to be of Jamalu-d-din's own breed. The average cost of each horse

was 220 Cdinars of red gold.' The cost even of those that, died on the
way was paid by the Pāņdya King for whom they were imported. Jamalu-
d-din's agent was a brother as it seems, Takiud-d-din Abdur-Rahman, son
of Muhammadu-t-Thaibi described as Marzaban ( Margrave ). This agent had
his headquarters at Kayal, and had the other ports of Fitan and Mali
Fitan also under his control. This description means that he was the agent-
general for the import trade of the Arabs in this part of the country, as
according to the same authority the trade of this region in those days, was
very great, both in volume and value. In the words of Wassaf "Ma 'bar
extends in length from Kulam to Nilawar (Nellore ) nearly three hundred
parasangs along the sea-coast, and in the language of the country the king
is called Dewar, which signifies the lord of empire. The curiosities of
Chin and Machin, and the products of Hind and Sind laden on large ships
(which they call junks ) sailing like mountains with the wings of winds on
the surface of the water, always arrived there. The wealth of the islands of
the Persian Gulf in particular and in part the beauty and adornments of
other countries, from Irak and Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe are
derived from Ma'bar, which is so situated as to be the Key of Hind"
(Elliot, iji. 32 ).
one The above graphic description of foreign trade of India in general
about A. D. 1290 and the horse-trade in particular will explain the genesis
of the horse-names according to their colours recorded by Hemacandra,
Someśvara and Jayadatta. We note with special interest that out of 10,000
horses imported into Kāyal, 1400 were to be of Jamalu-d-din's own breed.
In this connection I have to point out that the horse-name "ataala"
mentioned by Hemacandra may have been derived from some breeder of
horses of the name atzera. If this surmise is found to be correct, Hema.
candra's explanation of this name "aitu: wala atreta:" is pedantic and
imaginary like his explanations of other horse-names recorded by him.
Hemacandra mentions the atreta, horse as having to colours, Jayadatta
mentions "वेरुहान" or "वीरुहण" horse with पाटल colour. I think the
terms "atrera" and "àegra" are identical. They may indicate some
Arab breeder of horses of this name as I have observed above. Tudteido
000.01 In the present paper I have succeeded to a certain extent in link-
ing up the hourse-nomenclature as found in three different Sanskrit
sources which are more or less contemporary.1 I have now to request all
1 Out of 20 names of horses in in Hemacandra's list about 15 are found in Jayadatta's list.
This agreement leads us to infer that Heniacandra and Jayadatta are not much removed from
each other in their chronology, especially when we remember that Hemacandra has recorded

In the Rajapur Pāțhaśālā Sanskrit Manuscripts Collection there is
a small collection of Mss called the Shevade 1 Collection acquired in 1931.
Through the favour of my ever alert friend Pandit Raghunatha Šāstri
Patankar in charge of the above collection I could get for examination a
rare Ms of a Mimāṁsā work called the Rāmacandra-Candrodaya composed
by one “बाल गाडेगिल" or Balasastri Gadgil. The Ms consists of about 77
folios 2 on thin and worn-out country paper. The size of the Ms is 99 ins.
by 4 ins. Fach folio contains about 11 lines, each line containing about 33
letters. The Ms appears to be about 150 years old. It begins as follows:---

As the present work mentions the great mimāņsaka of Benares, viz.,

and his works :--

him. However, let me attempt his identification on the strength of Mara-

Mr. Katre searched in contemporary records. The result of this search is

Rs. 2000. Mr. Kátre suggests by way of a guess that this Lakşumibai
Gādagila may have been the wife of alocurTIENT Titiro referred to above.
(5) Grant Duff in his History of the Marathas ( 4th Edn. 1878),
Vol. 1, Chap. XXI, Page 623 mentions one " Bai Kishen Gargeel" as head
of the Poona Nyadeiish, or Court of Justice,' associated with Bālāji II,
who appointed him about A.D. 1749 as his first startat or Chief Justice.
In 1759 Rāma Šāstri Prabhuậe succeeded this Bāla Krsna Šāstri.
I am concerned in the above references with the name-sakes of
“as tiefits", the author of the Rāmacandra Candrodaya ( see Nos. 3 and
5 above). In particular the form of the surname " fire" in the signature
“ TIDUTIERT Fraigatiit TÈTIT " on a document of 3rd April 1772 is
exactly identical with that recorded by the author of the Rāmacandra-
Candrodaya, who calls himself “a12 piète" in three different verses in
the introductory portion of the work. If this identification is accepted we
are led to conclude that the author of the mīmāmsā work before me in the
form of the Rajapur Ms was living in A. D. 1772, presumably as a highly
respected old Pandita at Poona. Whether this Balakrsna Šāstri Gādegila
is identical with " Bal Kishen Gargeel,” the Nyāyādbisa of the Peshwa, say
between A. D. 1749 and 1759 as stated by Mr. Katre, cannot be definitely
determined at present
It is difficult to say what other Sanksrit authors of the Gādgil family 1
flourished before A.D. 1800. I know only one such author viz., Vaidyanātha
Gādagila, the author of a commentary on the Tarka-Samgraha of Annam.

(folios 37) in the Government Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute,
Poona. This Ms was written in Saka 1644 (=A.D. 1722) by one Jayarāma.
The colophon of the Ms reads as follows:-
-- " इति श्रीगाडगिलोपनामक रामकृष्णभट्टात्मजवैद्यनाथभट्टकृततर्कचंद्रिका स ॥ ६॥"
It is clear from this colophon that the author of this commentary
is Vaidyanātha Rāmacandra Gadgila, who is evidently earlier than A. D.
1722, while Bāla Gādegila, the author of the Mimāmsā work Rāmacandra-

subject of the present paper :-

22. A contemporary Sanskrit tribute to the musicials
20 talents of Tanasena, the greatest musican
of Akbar's court, and its historical
Perspective *
For any Indian National Biographical Dictionary, if such a work
is undertaken by our National Government in future years, the reconstruc-
tion of the life-history of every celebrity of ancient and mediaeval
India is absolutely essential. Such a life-history must be based, as far as
possible, on contemporary sources. During the last twenty-five years I
have published papers on numerous Sanskrit authors and their works.
In these papers I have taken care to record every bit of information about
the life-history of these authors, based on documentary evidence. I
have also brought to light many authors and historical personalities,
unkown to the historians of literature, culture and political history.
Recently I published a paper 1 on Vidyādhara, the Bengali architect of
Sevai Jaipur, who was a minister of Maharaja Sevai Jaising of Amber
(A. D. 1699–1743 ) and recorded in it some contemporary tributes to
this great Bengali from his contemporaries. It is necessary to record in a
similar manner contemporary tributes to other celebrities in the domain
of literature, music, art and allied subjects with a view to getting an
authentic picture of their life-histories.
I propose in the present paper to record a contemporary tribute to
TANSEN, the celebrated musician of Akbar's court, about whom we hear
many stories, sometimes of a mythical character.
In the Madhyayugina Caritrakośa by S. Chitrav Shastri (Poona,
1937, p. 424 ) I find the following information about Tānsen :-
* Journal of S. V, Ori. Institute, Tirupati, Vol VIII, Part I, pp. 1-8.
1. Vide pp. 285-294 of Dr. C. Kunhan Raja Volume, Madras, 1946. Since the publication
of this paper I have received the following additional information about Vidyādhara from my
friend Mr. Bimalacharan Deb of Calcutta in his letter of 4-12-1946 :-“You will be interested
to know that about 42 years ago ( to be precise in 1311 Bengal style, corresponding to 1904-05
A.C.) an article on Vidhyādhara appeared in the Vangiya Sāhitya Parishat Patrikā of
Calcutta. In this article a fair amount of information was given regarding him personally and
his family and descendants and also the times in which he flourished. In that article there is a
half-tone reproduction of a painting, showing Vidyādhara and his eldest son Murlidhara.
This painting, the writer says, was in the possession of Surajbux, a descendant of Vidyādhara.
The painting is "old stylo ", but the writer does not say if it was contemporary or not.” I
have to thank Mr. Deb very much for the above information, unknown to me. I have requested
Mr, Deb to publish a summary of the Bengali article on Vidyādhara in some Oriental journal
along with the picture of Vidyādhara and his eldest son.

A Tribute to the Musical Talents of Tānasena

como "TĀNSEN-(c. A. D. 1560 ) He was a Gauựa Brahmin
by caste. His father's name was Makaranda Pānde. He was
to resident of Gwalior. His father made a vow to a Muslim saint
Muhammad Ghosa for the birth of a son. Tānsen was born as a
result of this vow. The previous name of Tānsen was TANNA-
MITRA. He had an extra-ordinary imitative faculty. He could
imitate the sound of any animal perfectly. Once a saint of the
name Haridāsa Bābā was staying in his garden. Having observed
Tānsen's imitative faculty the saint requested Tānsen's father to
give Tānsen in his charge with a view to making Tānsen an
expert musician. The father agreed to this request and Tānsen
learnt music from Haridāsa Bābā and then returned to Gwalior.
Later the fame of Tānsen reached Emperor Akbar, who
Bao brought him to his court where he was included among the nine
jewels of the court. Akbar honoured him very much.
He has composed many dhrupadas in different rāgas, some
of which are his own inventions. In some of these dhrupadas
he has incorporated the name of his royal patron, Akbar. He
died at the age of 63 years. The rāgas invented by him are
Miya Malhār, Miyā Toņi, Miyā Sārang etc.
Once Tānsen and Akbar together listened to the singing
of Tānsen's guru. At this time Akbar questioned Tānsen : Why
should there be so much difference between your singing and
that of your guru? Tānsen replied that his guru Haridāsa Bābā
sings according to his mood but he himself has to sing in obe.
dience to Akbar's wishes."
In the above account of Tānsen's life and achievements the editor
of the Caritrakosa has not recorded the source from which he has drawn
the information about Tānsen; hence it is difficult to verify it.
In the Oriental Biographical Dictionary by T. W. Beale (revised by
H. G. Keen, London, 1894 ) page 400, I find the following remarks on
Tānsen :--
"TĀNSEN-A celebrated Hindi musician or Singer who
flourished in the time of Akbar and was employed by him. He
was originally in the service of a Rāja named Rāmchand and was
sent to court at the special request of the Emperor. He died in
the 34th year of that monarch's reign A. D. 1588, A. H. 996."
The musicians in India, both vocal and instrumental, ever since the
Musalmān conquests, who have been highly esteemed and whose names

as follows:--Gopāl, Amir Khusro, the poet, Baijā, Bhāno, Pāņdwā, Bakshū

of the dhurpad, in whose time also lived the four following:- Chārju,
Bhagwān, Dhondhī and Dalu: Tansen, Subhān Khān, Sürgayān Khan

and his brother Lālā Deibī, Mirza Aquil, Mian Shori, Ghutāmī, Lal
Khāni Nilam Prakāsh, and the Bin players, Firoz khan and Naubat khān."
Beale's account of Tānsen is evidently based on non-Sanskrit sour-
ces. I record below a tribute to Tānsen and his musical talent from a
contemporary Sanskrit Kāvya called the Virabhānūdaya Kavya, composed
by its author Madhava about A. D. 1555 according to Dr. Hiranand
Shastri. Canto X of this Kāvya deals with the reign of Rāmacandra, the
Baghela ruler of Rewa, who was a patron of Tānsen. This Rāmacandra
is identical with Raj Ramchand mentioned as Tānsen's employer in
Beale's article on Tansen. This canto tells us that Rāmacandra was a
great patron of music. He lavished his munificence on Tānasena, the
renowned musician of India, to whom, being pleased with his dhrupadas
he gave countless wealth. Tānasena was music incarnate. His dhrupadas
became very famous and are sung even now. The following verses of
Canto X refer to Tānasena and his enchanting dhrupadas and rāgas
which had made a name for him before A. D. 1555, when this Kāvya was
composed :--

The free translation of the above stanzas as given by the editors is
as follows:
" 26. Tānasena, the celebrated singer of his court, was indeed music
incarnate. Rāmacandra gave a crore of silver tankas for
every tune he sang,
27. He passed the whole day in listening to his songs and con-
sidered the succession of seasons as an instant in duration,
28. Tānasena was conversant with all languages and all the niceties
of the art of singing and seemed to surpass the celestial
songsters Hāha, Hūhū, Tumburu and Nārada. O
29. Tānasena had no equal in the past and present times and
probably none would equal him in the future and in the
heavens also there is none so proficient.
30. Immortal are his strains, which pervade the universe and
are steeped in the nectar of Rāmacandra's glories.
31. Wherever human speech shows its excellence Tānasena's
songs are sung."
From the above Sanskrit tribute to Tānasena of c. A. D. 1555 we
may now turn to Ain-i-Akbari 1 of c. 1590 A. D., in which we get the
following information about this greatest musician of Akbar's court :-
Page 406 - “89 Rājah Rāmchand Baghelah ....... Rāmchand was the
patron of the renowned musician and singer Tānsin, regarding
whom vide the List of Musicians at the end of this book. His
fame had reached Akbar; and in the 7th year the emperor sent
Jalāluddin Qūrchi ( No. 213) to Bhath to induce Tānsin to come
to Agra. Rāmchand feeling himself powerless to refuse Akbar's
request, sent his favourite with his musical instruments and
many presents to Agra, and the first time that Tānsin performed
at the court the emperor made him a present of two lakhs of

Jaganāth and Dirang khān were both weighed in silver and

The statement of Blochmann that Rāmchand gave one crore of
tankas tó Tānsen as present is corroborated by the Virabhānūdaya Kavya
(X 26 ) which states :-
" fraaf NATTEHTÀ FFATTÈTIT Potagszia I

Ramchand gave one crore of tankas for every dhrupada Tānsen sang.
Vincent Smith in his Akbar the Great Mogul ( Oxford, 1917), p. 50,
states that Bāz Bahadur, the king of Malwa, was an expert in music and
song and " like Tānsen, was reputed to have received instruction from
Adali or Muhammad Shāh Adil, the last of the Sūr kings (Badāoni, tr.
Ranking, i. 557)"
The Virabhānūdaya Kāvya (X. 13) refers to effes in the following
stanza :-
" geist taumatsata fai TETTHE FACTIE: 11 93 11"
Dr. Hiranand Shastri has identified GTAinAEFAT flores with Sultān.
Muhammad Sur Adali ( vide p. 17 of his Critical Analysis ), who gave
instruction to Tānsen in music. It is interesting to note that this reference
to ( Tānsen's guru ) grees or Adali occurs in the very canto in which we
find the verses referring to Tānsen and his musical talents (X. 26-31 ).

A Tribute to the Musical Talents of Tānasena

ons Speaking of "Tānsen and music" Vincent Smith observes (pp. 61-62
of Akbar the Great Mogul ) :-
" Akbar, although engaged in so much troublesome business
in various departments, was not indifferent to the pleasures of
life. He took special delight in music and song and seems to have
had a considerable knowledge of the technicalities of those arts.
o About this time ( 1562 ) he required Rāja Rāmchand of Bhath or
Rewā to send to court Tānsen of Gwalior, who was universally
recognized as the premier musician and singer of the age. Tānsen,
who became a Musalmān subsequently was received with marked
favour and liberally paid. He is credited by Abu-l Fazl with
having introduced' great developments' into his art. Conservative
Hindu musicians take a different view and accuse him of having
falsified the traditional rāgas, two of which, Hindol and Megh,
have disappeared since his time. Such critics hold that the in-
fluence of Tānsen was deleterious to the musical science of
India.1 It would seem possible that he may have violated the
ancient Hindu canons and sought to modernize his art by making
changes to suit Muslim taste. Few people have a right to express
any positive opinion on the subject and the author of this book is
not included among those few.”
On p. 100 of his Akbar, Smith gives an account of the surrender
of Kālanjar by Rājā Rāmchand of Rīwa A. D. 1569 and refers to this
Rājā as "the chief who had surrendered Tānsen, the musician, to Akbar's
demand.” On p. 59, Smith mentions the personal friends of Akbar, called
the "nine jewels" (Blochmann, Ain, Vol. i, p. 474, No 205; and the
nauratna picture in the Victoria Memorial Collection, Calcutta. — The
nauratna or “nine jewels" meant nine friends namely Rājā Birbal, Rājā
Mānsingh, Rājā Todar Mall, Hakim Humām, Mullā Dūpiyāza, Faizi,
Abu-l Fazl, Mirza Abdu-r rahim, Khān Khānan and Tānsen.) ” On pages
422-423 Smith makes the following remarks about Tānsen :-
den "All authorities and traditions are agreed that the best
performer at Akbar's court was Miyān Tānsen whom Akbar in
the 7th year of the reign had required the Rājā of Rīwā to
surrender. Abul Fazl declared that "a singer like him has not

been in India for the last thousand years." He was a close friend
of Sūr Dās, and like many of his contemporaries, received much
of his musical education at Gwalior, where Rājā Man Singh
Tomār ( 1486 – 1518 ) had founded a school of music. Tānsen
became a Muhammadan, assumed or was given the title Mīrzā,
and is buried in Muslim holy ground at Gwalior. Unfortunately,
he permitted himself to be ensnared by the prevailing vice of
Musalmans in that age. His talents included the composition of
verse. The date of his death does not seem to be recorded but he
certainly continued to serve in the court of Jahāngir (For Akbar's
music and Tānsen see ante chap. iii ; Ain, Vol. i, pp. 51 ( Aīn, 19
with plates ) and 611; A. N., ii, 279; Grierson Vernacular litera-
ture No. 60 etc.; A. S. R., ii, 370, with description of Tānsen's
tomb; A. H. Fox Strangways, The Music of Hindustan, Oxford,
1914, p. 83. Jahāngir confirms Abul Fazl's opinion of Tansen's
skill (Jahāngir R. B., i, 413 ). Tānsen is labelled as Mirzā in the
nauratna drawing. Rājā Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior must not
be confounded with his namesake, the Kachhwāha of Amber
(Jaipur). A good full-length portrait of Tāmen, on a small scale,
is included in a well-executed picture of Jahāngir's reign,
depicting a court-group, which is in the possession of the Royal
Asiatic Society ).
On p. 484 Smith refers to the Portraits of Akbar's friends and
contemporaries. About Tansen's portrait he writes :
"The Sketches in Vol. lvii of the Johnson Collection,
already mentioned, include some worthy of reproduction. The
best is No. 44, a slightly tinted sketch of Tānsen, the musician.
A good full-length portrait on a small scale of the same personage
is included in a picture of Jahangir's time, belonging to the Royal
Asiatic Society, and hung on the staircase."
The foregoing extracts from Vincent Smith's Akbar the Great Mogul
give valuable information about the life and achievements of Tānsen but
they do not contain any information about the career of Tānsen at the
court of Rāmachandra, the Baghela king of Rewa.
Some information about Tānsen has been recorded in the Mahā.

residing at Vịndāvan on the banks of Jumna. Tradition about
Akbar's visit in disguise to Haridāsa Svāmi --Raja Mansingh of
Gwalior, a great patron of music, supposed to be the originator of
dhrupad music --Two classes of Tānsen's followers:-- (1) Taifayt

I close these nutes on Tansen with a request to my South Indian
friends to record any references to this celebrated musician in datable
South Indian sources, Sanskrit or non-Sanskrit.

23. Vastusiromani, a work on Architecture
by Samkara, the Guru of Syamasaha,
son of Mananarendra - After
c. A. D. 1550*
Aufrecht records the following MSS of a work on architecture
called the Vāstuširomaņi :-
CC I, p. 568 —"Trafaretafo archit. Pheh. 9.
.- by Maharaja Śyāmasāh Samkara, N. P. 92 "
CC II, p. 224 - Do - Ulwar 1963.
All the MSS mentioned by Aufrecht in the above entries are in-
accessible to me.
In 1947 my friend Sri P. A. Mankad of Sabarmati presented to the
B. O. R. Institute a Devanagari copy of a MS of the Vastusiromani.1 This
copy was obtained in 1927 by Sri Mankad from Pandit Bhavani Dutt,
late Secretary to the Maharaja of Tebri (Garlal ) through Pandit
Narahari of Badrinath. The original MS from which the present copy
was made consisted of 83 folios, each folio containing about 10 lines on a
page. The present copy consists of 153 pages, each page containing about
18 lines, and each line containing about 26 letters.
The MS begins as follows :-
" श्रीमङ्गलमूर्तये नमः ॥

The foregoing list of references gives us a good idea about the
literature made use of by the author of the Vāstusiromanī in the eight
chapters ( prakaranas ) of his treatise on architecture. I shall now con-
sider the chronological value of some of these references for fixing the
earlier terminus for the date of the Vāstusiromaņi as follows :--
Na. 21-हेमाद्रि - Possibly Hemadri's work on dharmasastra called
C t he Caturvargacintāmani is referred to. Hemādri's date is
about A. D. 1260.
___No. 22-- राजमार्तण्ड - This appears to be a work on jyotis by King
Bhoja of Dhara ( C. A. D. 1050 ).
No. 27 -- situfa - He is the author of some astronomical works. He
flourished about A. D. 1050.

Page 213****************************************************************************************

Studies in Indian Literary History
Na. 3 -- paraqefa - This work is quoted freely in the Vastuširo-
maņi. It is a work on jyotis by Keśava, also known as araft
or flautala. This author flourished about A. D. 1496
( see p. 258 of History of Indian Astronomy by S. B.
Dīksita, Poona, 1896 ).
No. 41 -- fperafetttafo - This is the celebrated work on astronomy
by Bhāskarācārya composed in Śaka 1072=A. D. 1150
(see p. 246 of Hist. of Ind. Astronomy by S. B. Dīkşita ).
No. 42 -- aug27 - This is the work on jyotis by Viddaņa, son of
Mallaya. It is not much earlier than Saka 1400 ( A. D.
. 1478 ) See Hist. of Ind. Astronomy by S. B. D. - p. 292 ).
No. 44 -- TIA atsaft - One of his works is dated Śaka 1971= A. D.
1449 ( see p. 476, foot-note, of Hist. of Ind. Astro. by S.B.D.).
No. 49 -- TICIfa - This tantra by Laksmana Deśika belongs to the
11th cent. A. D. ( see p. 276 of J. N. Farquhar's Outline
of Religious Literature of India, Oxford, 1920 ).
No. 43 --Taattfa 3 - This work on judicial procedure has not yet
come to light. Its author Bhavadevabhatta lived about A.
D. 1100 ( see p. 305 of P. V. Kane's History of Dharma-
śāstra, Vol. I, B. O. R. Institute, Poona, 1930 ).
The references to Keśavapaddhati ( about A. D. 1496 ) and Rāma-
vājapeyi ( A. D. 1449 ) in the above list of datable references enable us
to conclude that the Vastuširomaņi is definitely later than c. A. D. 1550.
The exact date of the work can be fixed if we are able to identify King
Syāmasāha, son of King Māna, by whose order Guru Samkara composed
the Vāstu siromaņi as stated by him in verses 4 and 5 at the beginning of
the work.
In the Gazetteer of United Provinces, ( Vol. II, Calcutta, 1908, pp.
280-281 ) we find some history of Garhwāl Dist. No genealogy of the
Garhwal Chiefs is recorded in this history. The names of some Chiefs
recorded in this connection are as follows:
Sat Mahipat Shāh--( 17th century ) founded Srīnagar. He was the first
in his line to establish independence.
Pirthi Shāh - In 1654 A. D. Shah Jahan sent an expedition against
this Raja. He was driven from Srīnagar by Jagat
Chand ( A. D. 1708-1720 ).
Pradip Shāh -- He ruled from A. D. 1717-1772.
Lalat Shāh -- A. D. 1779.

wal rulers mentioned above. Without a complete genealogy of the

In the List of Inscriptions of Northern India by D. R. Bhandarkar
( Vols. XIV to XXIII of Epi. Indica ) we find Inscription No. 988 (p. 133
of the List ), which is dated Vikrama Samvat 1688= A. D. 1632. This
inscription is of the time of the Tomara Mitrasena found at Rohtas
(Jhelum Dist. Panjab ). The genealogy of the Tomara family of Gopācala
(Gwalior ) as given in the inscription is as follows :--
वीरसिंह

हुंगुरसिंह

(contemporary of साहि जल्लालदीन)
Curiously enough the names श्यामसाह and मानसाह (= मान नरेन्द्र ) mentioned
in the Vāstuširomaņi are found in the above genealogy. If these names
26

are identical with the names FTHATE and Anatle in the Gwalior line of
Kings the date of TUHATT would be A. D. 1632. In the Västuśiromani
श्यामसाह is ealled "माननरेन्द्रज" born of मान King. Normally the epithet
would mean "son of king #19 ” but if we take it to mean “born in the
line of king Ata” we can reconcile the genealogy of the Vastuširomani
with the statement of the inscription of A. D. 1632.
The above hyphothesis about the possible identification of FAIANIE
and Apat needs more evidence in support of it before we accept it as
final. Chronologically there would be no difficulty as the Vāstuširomani
has been shown by me to be later than c. A. D. 1550. I hope students of
the history of Garhwal State would throw some light on the names FOH-
साह and माननरेन्द्र mentioned in the Vastusiromani . area

24. The Contact of Bhattoji Dīksita and some Members of
his family with the Keladi Rulers of Ikkeri –
Between c. A. D. 1592 and 1645 *
Bhattoji Dīkşita, 1 the great grammarian of Banaras, lived between
C. A. D. 1550 and 1630. He had a circle of pupils, some of whom com.
posed works on grammar and other subjects. I have published papers on
the works of some of these pupils like Varadarāja, 2 Vanamāli, 3 Nīlaka-
ộtha Sukla. 4 His influence on subsequent authors 5 is also very great.
The family of Bhattoji was a learned one and appears to have enjoyed
some patronage of the Keladi rulers of Ikkeri in the Shimoga District of
the present Mysore State. I propose in this paper to record some evidence
of the contact of Bhattoji and other members of his family with the
Keladi rulers of Ikkeri between c. A. D. 1592 and 1645.
Dr. E. Hultzsch in his Report II on Sanskrit MSS in South India
(Madras, 1896 ) describes a MS of the Tattvakaustubha of Bhattoji
Dikșita as follows:-
Page XII --" The Tattvakaustubha ( No. 1243) was written by Bhattoji
Dīksita at the order of Venkatendra of Keladi. According to
Mr. Sewell's Lists of Antiquities, Vol. II, p. 177, Venkatapps
Nāyaka of Keladi reigned A. D. 1604 to 1626. ”

Dr. B. A. Saletore in his remarks on the age of Bhattoji Dīkşita in the
Karnatak Historical Review, Jan.-July 1937, identifies king “ Venkaten.
dra ", by whose order Bhattoji composed the Tattvakaustubha, with
Venkatapa Nayak I, who ruled from A. D. 1582 till A. D. 1629, and states
that this King was noted for the patronage he gave to learned men. 1
There is an incomplete MS of the Tattvakaustubha in the Govt. MSS
Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona (No. 319 of 1899–1915). At the
end of the third Pariccheda of this work (folio 6 ) we find the following
colophon:
"act asofagastsat al 12 971970: 1

From the extracts from the Tattvakaustubha quoted above it is clear
that Bhattoji had some contact with the court of King Venkatappa Nāyaka
I, who ruled at Ikkeri and belonged to the Keļa line of rulers. The
regnal period of this ruler is given differently by different scholars as
follows:
1. Hultzsch --" A. D. 1604 to 1624."
2. B. A. Saletore --"From A. D. 1582 till A. D. 1629."
In the pedigree of the Keladi rulers given in the Vijayanagara Com-
memoration Volume, 1936, p. 269, the regnal period of Venkatappa Nāyak
I is given as "A. D. 1592-1629." If this period is correct we can infer
that the contact of Bhattoji Dīkşita with this Keladi King must have
taken place sometime between A. D. 1592 and 1629.
Bhattoji's brother Rangojibhatta was also a very learned man. He
also appears to have enjoyed some patronage of the Keladi ruler Venka-
1. There is a MS of the Tattvakaustubha in the Govt. Ori. MSS Library, Madras (No. 4583
described on p. 3417 of Vol. IX of the Descriptive Catalogue, Madras, 1910). The three
verses quoted by me from the MS of this work described by Hultzsch are also found in this
MS. The reading in the first line of verse 2 in this MS is coolastey ” which is
evidently a wrong reading for the correct-reading“ maalaserseq.”
2. The Italian traveller Pietro della Valle who visited the Court of Venkatappa Nayak
I of Ikkeri in A. D. 1623 refers to 37EiT as follows on p. 272 of his Travels, Vol. II (1892);-
* Venk-tapā Naieke had a great and particular devotion to the idol Agoresuar, who is here
worshipped."

tappa Nayaka I (A. D. 1592-1629 ) who was a great patron of learning.
He had a son named Bhadrappa, who died during the life-time of his
father, leaving a son named Virabhadra. This prince assisted his grand-
father Venkatappa in the administration of the province and in course
of time succeeded him. Vīrasaivism appears to have been the faith of the
Keladi Nāyakas. They were great devotees of the Advaita Math of
Sệngeri. Venkatappa Nāyaka I wrote a commentary in Sanskrit on
Śivagītā. He patronised some scholars, like Tirumalabhatta, Ranganātha
Dīksita, Asyapandita, etc.1 In view of this information recorded by Shri
N. Lakshminarayan Rao in his article on the Nāyakas of Keladi in the
Vijayanagara Comm. Volume we must take the following verse in the
Vaiyākaraṇabhūşaņa of Rangojibhatta's son Koņdabhatta as genuine :-
"विद्याधीशवडेरुसंज्ञकयतिं श्रीमाध्वभट्टारक
जित्वा केलदिवेङ्कटय्यसविधेऽप्यान्दोलिकां प्राप्तवान् ।
यश्चक्रे मुनिवर्यसूत्रविवृतिं सिद्धान्तभङ्गं तथा
माध्वानां तमहं गुरूपमगुरुं रङ्गोजिभट्ट भजे ॥१॥"
(See pp. 259 of Vaiyākaraṇabhūşaņa in B. S. Series, 1915).
The first two lines in the above verse expressly state that Rangoji-
bhatta, the brother of Bhattoji and father of Koņdabhatta, defeated in
debate at the court of King Keļadi Venkațayya a Mādhya ascetic of the
name "vaderu " and got the honour of riding in a palanquin from Venka-
teppa Nayaka I ( A. D. 1595–1629 ).
From the evidence recorded so far it is clear that both the brothers
viz. Bhattoji and Rangoji had an intimate contact with the court of the
Keladi ruler Venkatappa Nāyaka I, though they normally resided at
Banaras and carried on their learned pursuits there. This Keladi ruler
must have entertained great respect for these brothers, who were follo-
wers of the Advaita doctrine, which appears to have been followed by
Venkatappa also in view of his being the devotee of the Advaita Math of
Srågeri like other rulers in the Keladi line of rulers. At any rate Konda-
bhatta mentions with pride and satisfaction the honour bestowed on his
father by Venkatappa for defeating a Madhya ascetic of the Dvaita School
of Vedānta.
The patronage to Bhattoji's family given by Venkatappa Nāyaka I
appears to have been continued by his grandson Vīrabhadra ( A. D. 1629-
1645 ), who succeeded him as will be seen from the following evidence:
1. See pp. 267-268 of Vijayanagara Comm. Volume. ..

Koņdabhatta, the nephew of Bhattoji composed & work called
"Tarkapradīpa" by the order of King Vīrabhadra, son of Bhadrendra as
stated by Kondabhatta in this work. An incomplete MS of this work has
been described by Hall in his Bibliography (1859), p. 79. In my articlel on
Kondabhatta, I have tried to prove that this patron Vīrabhadra, son of
Bhadrendra is identical with Virabhadra Nāyaka ( A. D. 1629–1645 ),
the son of Bhadrappa Nayaka, who died during the life-time of his father
Venkatappa Nayaka I. It appears, therefore, that Virabhadra enjoyed the
patronage of this Keladi ruler in the same way as that enjoyed by his
father Rangoji and his uncle Bhattoji at the Court of Vīrabhadra's grand-
father Venkatappa Nāyaka I ( A. D. 1595-1629).
The following table shows at a glance the contact of Bhattoji's family
with the Keladi rulers of Ikkeri between A. D. 1592 and 1645:-

Rangoji was a devotee of god flagratat ( Kālabastīsa ). He refers to this
god in the last portion of his Sivollāsa as follows:--

There is a railway station called Kālāhasti, in the Chitoor District of the
Madras State about 15 miles to the North of the Renigunta junction.
Nearby is the Kālāhasti Zamindari. There is a village of the name
Kālāhasti, near which is the temple of god Mahādeva, with five faces.
This god is the celebrated Kālahastiśa referred to by Rangoji. Rao Bhadur
W. A. Bambardekar2 thinks that the native place of Bhattoji's family
must have been in the vicinity of the Kālahastiśa, which appears to be
the family deity of the family of Bhattoji Dikṣita.
In view of the South Indian origin of Bhattoji's family explained by
my friend the late Rao Bhadur Bambardekar it is easy to understand the
contact of this family with the Keladi rulers of Ikkeri in the Shimoga
District of the Mysore State as explained in this paper.

25. The Chronology of the Works of Kondabhatta oss
(A Nephew of Bhattoji Diksita )
Between A. D. 1610 and 1660 * 22
AUFRECHT records the following works of Koņdabhatta, the son of
Rangojibhatta and nephew of Bhattoji Dīkşita :

I am concerned in this paper mainly with the later limit for the
date of the TATATIIT or à 1#TOTTTT of which the Q219TUTHOTETT
is an abridgment by Kondabhatta himself. The Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute MS of Q. TEIT, ( No. 226 of 1882-83 ) is described
by Dr. Belvalkar on p. 259 of his Catalogue of Grammar MSS, Vol. II,
Part I, 1938. The age of this MS as recorded by him is “ Samvat 1716
or 1766. " If we accept “ Samvat 1716 -= A. D. 1660, the later limit for
the date of this work would be A. D. 1660. If we accept " Samvat 1766" =
A. D. 1710, the later limit would be A. D. 1710.
- A Ms of a TIETOT HETU by Kondabhatta No. 1610 in the Desai Collec-
tion of the Bombay University is described by Prof. H. D. Velankar on p.
279 of his Catalogue of this collection (1953). It is dated “ Samvat
1762" = A. D. 1706.
Eggeling describes a MS of the a719TUTUTUTEIT in the India Office
Library on p. 188 of his Catalogue of I. O. MSS., Part II (1889 )-- MS
No. 711. This MS is dated " Samvat 1706 " = A. D. 1650. If this date is
correct we may fix A. D. 1650 as the later limit for the date of gentagota
and its abridgment à. T. ET. Possibly this MS was copied during the

life-time of Kondabhattar. If a MS of the abridgment is dated A. D. 1650,
the original work viz. the TATUIHTTU must have been composed by its
author many years prior to A. D. 1650.
K. P. Trivedi in his edition of the Vaiyākaranabhasanasāra etc.,
describes a MS of the à TATOTHTUAR on p. 13 of his critical notice of
MSS (from Dehla's Bhandar, Ahmedabad ), which is dated " Samvat
1729" = A. D. 1663. This date is in harmony with the date A. D. 1650 of
another MS of this work described by Eggeling.
Kondabhatta's न्यायपदार्थदीपिका or पदार्थदीपिका published in the Benares
Sanskrit Series contains the following references by Kondabhatta to his
other works vis. (1) वैयाकरणभूषण and तर्करत्न, as pointed out by K. P.
Trivedi on p. 19 of his introduction.
_P. 32 "वैयाकरणमतं तु भूषणे अस्माभिः प्रपञ्चितम्"
( see also folios 44, 46, of MS No. 774 of 1887-91 at B. O. R. Institute).
P. 51 " निरूपितमस्माभिस्तर्करत्ने"
In view of the data recorded above we can safely conclude that
Kondabhattas composed the following works before A. D. 1650 :-
(1) वैयाकरणभूषण
(2) वैयाकरणभूषणसार MSS of A. D. 1650, 1660. 00
Kondabhatta's पदार्थदीपिका was written later than his वैयाकरणभूषण and तर्करत्न,
since these two works are mentioned in it. Kondabhatta mentions the
following authors and works in his Vaiyākaraṇabhūşana ( appendix II to
B. S. S. edition, pp. 730-731):-

Hall on p. 79 of his Bibliography (Calcutta, 1859 ) describes a fragment of
Koņdabhatta's ageta as follows :-
"This work was compiled at the instance of Rājā Vīrabhadra, son
of Rājā Bhadrendra. Vīrabhadra is eulogized by the author for having
given an impulse to the revival of the practice of sacrifice." "This work
cites न्यायलीलावती and अद्वैतचिन्तामणि.” The date of तर्कप्रदीप can be deter-
mined if we can identify the patron-king Vīrabhadra, son of king Bhadren.
dra. Very probably this Virabhadra is identical with King Virabhadra,
son of Bhadrapa Nayak, about whom the following information is re-
corded in the Madhyayugina Caritra Kośa by Chitrav Shastri, on p. 747 :-
" Vīrabhadra ( A. D. 1629-1645), King of Bednur, son of Bhadrapa
Naiyak ........ He was originally king of Ikkeri. When Shabāji and Raņa-
dullākhān conquered Ikkeri 1 in A. D. 1637, he began to reside at Bednur.
He died without issue.” ( see farqHitagealaat, pp. 105-106 ).
. If the above identification is accepted the date of angela could be
fixed during the reign of atta? viz., A, D, 1629-1645. King Vīrabhadra, the
patron of Koņdabhatta, belonged to the line of Keladi Chiefs, whose
capital was at Ikkeri first and at Bednur later. Kondabhatta's father
Rangojibhatta had some contact with the Keladi court as will be seen
from the following stanza at the end of the a716TUTUTO (p. 259 of B. S. S.
edition ).

u. 1. About Ikkeri see p. 508 of Vol. V of the Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1885. Ikkeri is
a village in the Shimoga District of Mysore State. From A.D. 1560 to 1640 it was the capital
of Keladi Chiefs. The cradle of this dynasty was at Keladi in Shimoga District. Finally this
dynasty fixed its residence at Bednur or Nagar. Bednur was captured by Haidar Ali in 1763
and the territory of the Keladi Chiefs was annexed to Mysore.

his father Rangojibhatta conquered in debate a Mādhva ascetic called
Vaderu at the court of King Keladi Venkatayya..
Kavindra Paramānanda's. S'ivabhārata ( ed. by S. M. Divekar, B. I.
S. Mandal, Poona, 1927 ), composed between A. D. 1661 and 1674,' contains
the follwing references to Virabhadra, King of Bednur :-
“aat faceyratai atTHE RETFREI "
(afticu galaa etc. ).

King Shahāji conquered Virabhadra and pleased Raņadullākhān:- :
"Toizgara asalaga agli
HEIAT Faetita aTTHETSFE İSTEITI”fani
B
E
(Chap. XI, 6)
Vīrabhadra was helped by King Shahāji to re-ascend the throne
from which he had been removed by Raņadullākhān :-
“S of Thaal Haar fortsa: 1
व्यस्मरद्वीरभद्रोऽपि छत्रचामरसपदः ॥”
(Chap. XVII, 7)
The verse refers to the conquest of Virabhadra's kingdom by Ali
Shah of Bijapur.
The Italian traveller Pietro della Valle in his Travels ( A. D. 1623-
1624) describes in detail his visit to Ikkeri, where Venkatappa Naik was
ruling. In his account of the 21st November 1623 on p. 284 ( ed. by
Hakluyt Society, London, 1892 ) Pietro della Valle refers to “ Virabadra
Naieka, a young boy, his son's son, whom he ( Venkatappa Naik ) designs
for his successor." I believe this “Vira-badra Naieka" is identical with
Virabhadra Nāyak of Bednur ( Bindupura ), mentioned in the S'ivabhārata,
whom I have identified with Virabhadra, the patron of Kondabhatta.
The dates for Virabhadra recorded in the Madhyayugina Caritra
Kośa are A. D. 1629-1645. If these dates are correct we have to presume
that Venkatappa Nāyak or Keladi Venkatayya who ruled at Ikkeri in A, D.
1623-1624 may have continued his rule upto A. D. 1629. Very probably
Rangojibhatta defeated in a debate the Madhva ascetic 'Vaderu 'l at the
court of this Venkatappa Nāyak of Ikkeri sometime prior to A. D. 1629.
1 Possibly this Madhya ascetic named · Vaderu 'belonged to the Vaisnava Math of the
Sārasvata Brahmins at Partagali in the Cancon division of Goa. Nārāyaṇa Tirtha was the
founder of this Math. He was honoured with the title · Vadera' by Siddanna Nayaka of the
Keladi family. The date of admission of Nārāyana Tirtha into the Madhva fold is the 8th
March 1475. ( see article by G. H. Khare on the Archives of the Partagali Math in the
Proceedings of tie Indian Historical Records Commission, 1951, pp. 50-55.)

In the genealogical tree of the Nāyakas of Keladi, given on p. 269
of the Vijayanagara Commemoration Volume ( 1936 ) by N. Lakshmi
Narayan Rao, we find the dates of Venkata ppa I, Bhadrappa and Vīrabha-

Rangoji Bhatta's contact with the court of Keladi Venkatappa I must have
taken place sometime between A. D. 1595 and 1629, while Kondabhatta's
contact with Vīrabhadra must have taken place between A. D. 1629 and
1645.

26. The Relative Chronology of some Works of Nāgojibhatta
Between c. A, D, 1670 and 1750 *
Dr. P. V. Kanel has given us a good account of Nāgojibhatta of
Banaras and his literary activity of an encyclopaedic character. According
to him Nāgoji" flourished towards the end of the 17th century and the
first half of the 18th century.” “His literary activity must be placed
between 1700 and 1750 A. D.". This chronology is fairly correct, but it
needs to be corroborated by a study of the extant works of Nāgoji and their
relative chronological order. For want of leisure I cannot undertake such
a laborious study; but as a first step in this direction I record below the
results of my study of some works of Nāgoji from the chronological point
of view. It is hoped that these results will clarify at least to some extent
the relative chronology of these works and also substantiate the views of
Dr. Kane about the chronology for Nāgoji's life and literary career referred
to above.
Before recording the results of my present study I note below the
names of the works of Nāgoji so far known:-

MS No.984 — Do— MS dated Śaka 1734 = A.D-1812. The date of MS
No. 983 recorded by Dr. Devasthali is “ Samvat 1644." If this is correct
it can be interpreted as follows:--
(1) If the date 1644 belongs to Vikrama Samvat it is equal to A. D.
1588. This date for a MS of Nāgoji's work is impossible as Nāgoji lived
definitely after c. A. D. 1640.
(2) If the date 1644 belongs to Saka era it is equal to A. D. 1722.
This date for the MS is possible as it does not conflict with the chrono-
logy for Nāgoji's works fixed by scholars.

- It is clear from these three references that Nāgojibhatta's gata
on the flatgeta of Govinda was composed after the composition of his
वैय्याकरणसिद्धान्तमंजूषा.
* There is a MS of Nāgojibhatta's Vaiyākaraṇa-Siddhānta-Mañjūşa
( No. 1295 ) in the library of Scindia Oriental Institute, Ujjain, copied in
Saka 1630 = A. D. 1708. My friend Sri S. L. Katre, the Curator of the
Institute has kindly supplied to me the following extract from the colo-
phon of this MS:-
- "वैयाकरणसिद्धान्तमंजूषा या कृता मया।
तया श्रीभगवान्साम्बः शिवो मे प्रीयतामिति ॥

One Ratnākara Tripāthi copied this MS at Almodā ( Almora ) in
the Kūrmācala (Kumaon ) territory at a place near the house of Vireśvara.
Pandita on Budhavāra, 14th day of the bright fortnight of the month of
Caitra of Saka 1630. This date corresponds to Wednesday, 24th March
1708 according to Indian Ephemeris, Vol. VI by Pillai, page 218. The
date of this work must, therefore, be earlier than A. D. 1708.
__ The B. O. R. Institute has a MS of the वैयाकरणसिद्धान्तमंजूषा ( No. 33

In the above list of references, the reference by Nāgojibhatta to his

no other than the AETH[Tugta-gula of this author. It is, therefore, clear
that Nagojibhatta's महाभाष्यप्रदीप - उद्योत was composed earlier than his
aanufag Fa#597 of which a MS dated A. D. 1708 is available in the
library of the Scindia Oriental Institute, Ujjain.
I gratefully record below references in Nāgojibhatta's works to his
other works supplied by my friend Prof. K. V. Abhyankar:-
(1) In लघुमंजूषा ( Benares Edition ) Nagoji mentions his शब्देन्दुशेखरः-
Page 1033—-"yasz jaafaa #Tkautfafa ya TecTa ”
Page 1088--"fa 39-47 giga# " ( according to Vaidyanātha Pāya-
gunde, the pupil of Nāgoji 67719=ofagatat )..
(2) In महाभाष्यप्रदीपोद्योत (Benares Edition) Nagoji mentions मंजूषा on
the following pages: --
Page 8—- “laafqa saa HFIA” (see also pp. 14, 54, and the
following sūtras :-1, 2, 58; 1, 3, 72; I, 4, 54 ).
(3) In zato garet ( Benares Edition ) Nāgoji mentions his ( HET)
377649etalata on the following pages :-
Page 437–"gaat gagtatalà Gargai” ( see also pages 527 and 572).
From the glca of Vaidyanātha Pāyagunde on the god gaat wo
find that there are many indirect references in this work to Nāgoji's
other works indicated by 37+45 as found on the following pages of the
Benares Edition :-

(4) In his commentary on the Rasagańgādhara of Jagannātha
Paņditarāya Nāgoji mentions his #TA ( see p. 360 of Nirnaya Sagara
Press Edition of the Rasayangādhara ).
(5) In HorEITET ( ed. by Kielhorn, B. S. Series ) Nāgoji mentions
his other works as follows: -
(i) Traiter (pp. 21, 31 64, 104, 114 )
(ii) 267gstalenia ( pp. 43, 72 )
(iii) HTAT (pp. 79, 109)

From the data recorded so far we can tentatively draw the following
conclusions :--
(1) In his etiaitaladie Nägoji ( EN ) mentions fauigiay (A. D. 1612).
In his Frigocqueta N mentions VATHE ( between A. D. 1540 and 1600 ),
waga ( between A. D. 1645-1675 ) and agifsa ( between A. D. 1595 and
1630). N is, therefore, later than c. A. D. 1670.
(2) The Ujjain MS of N's Tatuagiaága is dated A. D. 1708.
(3) The A. S. B. ( Calcutta ) MS No. 4223, of N's voluminous work
HETHISTICT-gala is dated A. D. 1738.
(4) In the वै. सि. मंजूषा N mentions his महाभाष्यप्रदीपउद्योत, which in
its turn mentions a. fÀ. #979). This cross-reference proves that both these
works were being composed simultaneously some time earlier than A. D.
1708, which is the date of the Ujjain MS of #. ff. 674.
(5) These voluminous works viz. the वै. सि. मंजूषा and महाभाष्यप्रदीप-
gyta are the products of N's mature intellect and scholarship. Presuming
that N was about 30 years old at the time of their composition sometime
before A. D. 1708, the date of a copy of one of these works, we may easily
infer that N was born say between A, D. 1670 and 1680. This inference is
in harmony with his reference to Anantadeva ( A. D. 1645-1675 ).
(6) Very probably N composed his वै. लि. मंजूषा and महाभाष्यप्रदीप-
gaita between c. A. D. 1700 and 1708.
(7) N composed his commentary on the TAÅFift of Bhānudatta
called the TAÐAut sometime before A. D. 1712, which is the date of a
MS of this work in the India Office Library (See p. 355 of India Office
Catalogue, Vol. III) as pointed out by S. K. De in History of Sanskrit
Poetics, Vol. I (1923).
(8) N composed his commentary on the Rasagañgādhara after his
composition of the वै. सि. मंजूषा as he mentions वै. सि. मंजूषा in this commen-
tary. Very probably this commentary was composed by N sometime after
A. D. 1700.
(9) N composed his काव्यप्रदीप-उद्योत, which mentions वै. सि. मंजूषा, also
after A. D. 1700.

(10) N composed his araitaiquiat sometime before A. D. 1722, which
is possibly the date of a MS of this work (No. 933) in the Bombay
University collection of MSS.
(11) N composed his लघुमंजूषा sometime after his वै. सि. मंजूषा (bet-
ween A. D. 1700 and 1708 ).
(12) N composed his after his too-gitET (=Eodegatet )
as he refers to शब्देन्दुशेखर in the लघुमंजूषा.
(13) N composed his लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर after his बृहच्छब्देन्दुशेखर.
( 14 ) N mentions AETHICUIET-Jata (Between A. D. 1700 and 1708)
in his लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर. Evidently the लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर is later than A. D. 1700.
(15) N composed his परिभाषेन्दुशेखर after his वै. सि. मंजूषा and महाभाष्य-
Teta-gala (both composed between c. A. D. 1700 and 1708 ) and also after
qayergaret as these works are mentioned by him in the afTHIÊ-CITET.
(16) N composed his ago CERTET some time before A. D. 1721 as
we have the following dated MSS of this work in the library of the Oriental
Institute, Baroda:-
Accession No. 846– zatoeagatet, MS dated Samvat 1777 ( = A. D.
1721 ). ( see pp. 714- 715 of Alphabetical List, Vol. I, 1942 ).

(see pp. 716-717 of Alphabetical List, Vol. I, 1942 ).
Evidently N composed his qazgofaciat earlier than c. A. D. 1715
as the लघुशब्देन्दुशेखर is an abridgment of the बृहच्छब्देन्दुशेखर. As the लघुशब्देन्दु.
dat mentions à fa. Áfga1( between A. D. 1700 and 1708) it is later than c. A.
D. 1700 and earlier than A.D. 1721, the date of the Baroda MS of this work.
(17) N composed his $1579&ta-gua before A. D. 1754, the date of
MS No. 1293 of this work in the Desai collection of MSS of the Bombay
University ( see p. 236 of H. D. Velankar's Cata. 1953). As this work
mentions à, fa. #79 ( between A. D. 1700 and 1708 ) it was composed
before A. D. 1754 but later than c. A. D. 1700.
(18) N composed his peza17 with commentary before A. D. 1733,
the date of MS No. 1402 of this work in the Desai collection of the
Bombay University (see. p. 258 of Velankar's Cata. 1953. )
(19) Besides the Ujjain MS of Q. fq. #991 dated A. D. 1708 there

27. Date of Vasudeva's Commentary on the
Karpuramanjarī of Rajas'ekhara
( Between A. D. 1450 and 1700 )*
The following commentaries on Rājasekhara's Karpūramañjarī have
been recorded by Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum :-
CC I, p. 82 — (1) by Kāmarāja ( Premarāja )
Cut (2) by Krşņasūnu
(3) by Dharmadāsa
(4) Ratnamañjarī by Pītām bara
(5) Karpūramañjarīprakāsa by Väsudeva K 70; Peters. 3. 393.
(6) Karpūramañjarichāyā
CC II, p. 15 — Karpūramañjarīprakāśā by Väsudeva L. 3288; Peters. 4,25;
Stein 77 ( inc.)
I am concerned in this paper with Vasudeva's commentary which is
available in a published form.1 Its editor has not determined the date of
the commentator Vāsudeva. I propose in this paper to put some limits to
his date.
Vasudeva was the son of Prabhākara and Gomatí as stated in the
following stanza at the beginning of his commentary :-
"तातं प्रभाकरं नत्वा मातरं गोमतीमपि । कर्पूरमञ्जरीटीका वासुदेवेन तन्यते ॥"
In all the colophons found in the commentary the name of the
author, the name of his father and the name of the commentary viz.
कर्पूरमंजरीप्रकाश are recorded as follows:--
"gfa sit...TH1#THETAFalgeafatlarà #gtasTFIET”
According to Aufrecht ( CC I, p. 567 ) Tigca composed a work on
#THİAT called the authE-
A A-7#17 dealing with the substitution of milk
for intoxicating spirits in the algù ceremony. ( See Hall's Bibliography,
p. 292 ). This work cites त्रिकाण्डमण्डन, सौत्रामणि and the मिताक्षरा of विज्ञानेश्वर
(c. A. D. 1070-1100 ). The MS “ Peters 4.25" mentioned by Aufrecht is
identical with MS No. 662 of 1886-92 ( कर्पूरमञ्जरी with प्रकाश by वासुदेव )
in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. Another MS
of Vāsudeva's T 14 mentioned by Aufrecht is “ Peters 3:393” which is
* Oriental Thought, Vol. I, No. 1, pp. 59-62.

Vāsudeva's Commentary on the Karpuramañjarī of Rājasekhara 221
identical with MS No. 278 of 1884-86 in the Govt. MSS Library. Both
these MSS bear no dates. They appear to be at least 150 years old. The
MS “K. 70" of 9 11 recorded by Kielhorn in his List of C. P. MSS,
Nagpur, 1874, p. 70, is mentioned by Kielhorn to be about 125 years old.
If this statement is correct the MS appears to have been copied about
A. D. 1750 which is, therefore, the later limit to the date of Vāsudeva.
The earlier limit to the date of Vāsudeva may now be fixed on the basis
of references in the commentary. Works and authors mentioned by
Vāsudeva in his #GTAFIT=137 (N. S. Press, Bombay, 1949) are as follows:-

are as follows:-

Sanskrit Poetics Vol. I, 1923, by S. K. De ). Between A. D. 1300 and 1380
(See p. 421 of P. V. Kane's Sanskrit Poetics, 1951 ).

No. 9 — 919756127 — This is obviously the 12:41 by Sāradātanaya--
between A. D. 1100 and 1300 ( See p. 242 of g. K. De's Poetics, Vol. I).
between 1175 and 1250 A. D. ( See p. 405 of P. V. Kane's Sanskrit Poetics).
___No. 7- नाट्यप्रदीप- A work of this name was composed by सुंदरमिश्र
ait ftoft in A. D. 1613 ( See p. 402 of P. V. Kane's Sanskrit Poetics ).
No. 13 - 91%T — Very probably this work is identical with the
TAIZG917 of fF4116- A. D. 1340-1360 according to A. N. Krishna
Aiyangar ( See p. 411 of P. V. Kane's Sanskrit Poetics ).
No. 16 -- poſtajalT — Sarngdeva, the author of this work on music,
was patronised by the Yādava king Singhņa ( A. D. 1210-1247 ). ( See p.
419 of P. V. Kane's Sanskrit Poetics, 1951 ).
__As वासुदेव mentions and quotes from the साहित्यदर्पण (c. A. D. 1300-
1380 ) we may fix about A. D. 1450 as the earlier terminus to the date of
his commentary on the कर्पूरमज्जरी. If the work नाट्यप्रदीप quoted by him is
identical with the artista composed in A. D. 1613 by Sundaramiśra
Aujāgari this earlier limit can be pushed up to about A. D. 1650, the
later limit being about A. D. 1750 fixed by me already on the strength of
the age of a MS of Vāsudeva's Prakāśa recorded by Kielhorn.
Vasudeva records the following vernacular equivalents in his
commentary :-
Page 18 -- "AEITISTH19191# 'faeqz'zfagfaga”
Page 27 -- "ZCOTT TT1a I'gfa H9RIEI"
Perhaps Vāsudeva hailed from Mahārāştra and knew the Marathi
language.
In the light of evidence recorded above we can arrive at the follow-
ing conclusions regarding Vāsudeva's date :--
(1) The date of Vāsudeva definitely lies between A. D. 1450 and
1750.
( 2 ) If the the work Nātyapradīpa mentioned by Vāsudeva is
identical with the Nātyapradīpa composed by Sundaramiśra in A. D. 1613,
the date of Vasudeva can be fixed between A. D. 1650 and 1750.

28. Some Puranic Extracts quoted by Apararka
(c. A. D. 1125 ) and their
bearing on the History of Indian
Paleography and Education *
In my paperi on the History of Ink-manufacture in India, I have
recorded some recipes which appear to be later than A. D. 1200. The
earliest among these recipes is that from a work on alchemy called the
Rasaratnākara of Nityanātha Siddha assigned by scholars to about the
13th century. Since this paper was published I happened to read some
portions of the commentary on the Yājñavalkyasmrti by A parārka, who is
assigned by M. M. Prof P. V. Kane to A. D. 1125.
In the dānaprakaraņa of the Yājñavalkyasmrti ( chapter I, prakarana
8,) Yājñavalkya extols aga or fattigia in verse 212. In commenting upon
this verse Aparārka quotes several authorities 2 such as TA, TEFTſa, afaceri-
FIT, FEFTOTIU, afegrua, etc. The long extracts from the three Parāṇas
pertaining to faigia are important as they contain some literary and
paleographical material. These extracts deal with the following topics :-
(1) भविष्योत्तर :-- Worship of पुस्तक ( manuscript), description of मषी
(ink), A TH17# (ink-pot ), formula of ink, qualifications of a
Set ( writer of MSS), instructions regarding the writing of
Mss, depositing MSS in a Ad or monastery, the merit acquired
by donating Mss of Purāṇas, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata ;
endowment for the maintenance of a preceptor ( 3978ztuala-
CH); endowment for providing food, raiment etc. to students
and making provision for students pursuing a study of technical
sciences and arts ( TETIETETTET ), endowment for the constant
reading of religious manuscripts in the temples of gods, Siva,
Vişnu and Sūrya.
(2) HETETT :-- Donating of the MSS of the following Purānas
according to specific vidhis :- (a) je 10000, Jagtto, ( b ) ju
55000, 79971, (c) je 23000, fècorgrin, ( a ) sie 24000, aiYYTI",

3 The extent of each Purāņa in granthas indicated here as part of Aparārka's com-
mentary would be an important testimony bearing on the extent of each of the 18 Purānas
about A. D. 1100, provided these grantha figures are found in the earliest dated Mss of Apa-
rārka's commentary and corroborated by other reliable evidence.
4 सस्यविद्या means possibly the science of agriculture.. It is also called सस्यवेद in the
following lines of the नन्दिपुराणः --
" " सस्यवेदप्रदानेन संपन्ना यस्य शालयः।

Evidently there were some treatises on H ell, which are now lost. The only treatise
we know at present is कृषिपराशर.

इति विद्याप्रदानस्य महाभाग्यं प्रकीर्तितम् ॥"
The foregoing brief analysis of the Purāņic extracts quoted by
Aparārka gives us a good idea of the importance attached to faggia and
its beneficial effects on the educational activities of ancient times prior to
A. D. 1100. In the mechanism of education, so graphically described in
these extracts every part had its own importance as the following series
of these parts will show :--
लेखक - पुस्तक-वाचक -- गुरु-श्रावक
The idea of acquiring merit ( punya ) by fariera prompted the rich
and pious public of the day to contribute its mite for keeping this mecha-
nism well oiled and in smooth working order.
The remarks in the Purānic extracts about ( scribe ) with his
writing accessories have a paleographic interest, while those about arah
( reader ), गुरु (preceptor ) and श्रावक (disciple) possess an educational
interest.
The following lines in the extracts from the Bhavişyottarapurāna
refer to a formula for ink which appears to have been current before
A. D. 1100:-
"सौवर्णी लेखनी कार्या रौप्यं च मषिभाजनम् ।
दीपज्वालासमुद्भूतकजलेन मषी भवेत् ॥
औदुम्बरामत्रपाणिघृष्टबोलरसान्विता।"
The pen should be made of gold, the ink-pot should be made of
silver. The ink should be prepared form lamp-black mixed up with बोलरस

( juice of aloes or gum.myrrh ) and pounded with hand in a tray or vessel
(STH) of Audumbara wood i. e. wood of the udumbara (Ficus Glomerata),
which is one of the seven holy trees in India. I cannot say what special
purpose was served by the udumbara wood and its contact with the
mixture of any and ato. In some of the formulas of ink recorded by me
the use of cooper vessels for mixing up the ink-ingredients is prescribed,
though in these formulae fiuto and ato remain as main ingredients. In
the above formulae from the Bhavisyottara purāna we have the simplest
process of making ink, which appears to have been in use more than a
thousand year ago in India in writing manuscripts on palm leaves, as
paper had not then made its appearance in India. The writing outfit
then consisted of a box with ink, ink-stand and pens, as also blank leaves
(पत्रमषीपात्रलेखनीसंपुटादिकम् ) as expressly stated in the Nandipurana extract
quoted by A parārka. This out-fit was presented to the learned men of
the day ( T: afHYTIT ) with a view to acqiring merit ( goz ). Even
today we present to friends sets of writing materials like fountain-pens,
ink-stands etc. but it is doubtful whether these accessories have stimulated
or facilitated any literary effort in them. They remain on the tables of our
friends only for display, at times with a dry ink.pot and a broken holder
or nib or a leaking fountain.pen.
As regards the lamp-black used for ink-manufacture in India from
ancient times, I have to state that some product from soot or lamp-black
was exported to Greece and Rome for the manufacture of black colour
used by painters in these countries as stated by Dr. Albert Neuberger.5
5 Vide pp. 194-195 of Technical Arts and Sciences of the Ancients. (Eng. Translation
by H. L, Brose, Methuen and Co. ( 1930 )—Speaking of Inorganic Dyes and Painter's Colours
Dr. Neuberger observes :-
"For making black, soot was the chief source. It was produced as nowadays in special
works. Pitch, resin, chips from the pine, beeswax, dried remains of the grape and other sub-
stances, were burned in chambers, whose walls were as smooth as possible and in many cases
made of polished marble. The soot which deposited itself was scratched off. Further bone black
was also in use; it is supposed to have been discovered by the most celebrated painter in Greece
namely, Apelles ( about 325 B. C. ) who produced it by charring ivory. Bone black was extra-
ordinarily dear and was only seldom employed. On the other hand wood-tar was sometimes
used, as well as a black derived from India, which is probably identical with our Indian ink, and
so likewise represented a product from soot.
