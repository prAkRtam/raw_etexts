SHRI BAHADUR SINGHJI SINGHI
BY
Acharya Jina Vijaya Muni
On the 7th of July 1944, Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi
left his mortal coils at the comparatively early age of fifty-nine.
His loss has been widely felt. His aged mother received this
rude shock so ill that she did not long outlive him. His worthy
sons have lost an affectiɔnate and noble father, the industrialists
and businessmen of the country one of their pioneers, the large
number of his employees a benevolent master, scholarship one of
its best patrons and the poor people of his native district a most
generous donor. To me his loss has been personal. My contact
with him was a turning point in my life. Whatever I have been
able, during the past fifteen years, to achieve in the field of
scholarship is due directly to him. The financial assistance with
which he backed up my activities was the least of his contributions.
But for his love of scholarship with which he inspired me, this
chapter of my life would have been entirely different. To his
sacred memory I am penning these few lines. This volume is
brought out in his memory.
Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji was born in Azimganj, Murshida-
bad, in Vikram Samvat 1941, in the ancient family of the Singhis,
who were of old the treasurers of the Mughal emperors. The
family had passed through many vicissitudes of fortune and in the
17th century it migrated from Rajaputana to Bengal, but thanks to
the cnergy and enterprise of Singhiji's father, Babu Dalchandji
Singhi, the family firm became a very flourishing concern.
At an early age Singhiji joined the family business and by
pushing ahead with father's enterprises, succeeded in making the
firm the foremost in the mining industry of Bengal and Central
India. Besides he also acquired vast zamindaries and had interests
in many industrial and banking concerns. This early preoccupa-
tion with business affairs prevented his having a college education.
But Singhiji was studious and introspective by nature. Unlike
many other wealthy men who spend their money and time in such
fads as the races, the theatres, and the like, he devoted all his
spare time to study and cultural development. He acquired an
excellent command over several languages. Art and literature
were the subjects of his choice. He was very fond of collecting
rare and invaluable specimens of ancient sculpture, paintings,
coins, copperplates and inscriptions. His manuscript collection
contained a large number of rare works of historical and cultural
importance, among which mention must be made of a unique

Page 15****************************************************************************************
manuscript of the Koran which was handed down from Baber to
Aurangzeb and bears the autographs of all of them. It is record-
ed therein that it was considered by them all as more valuable
than the empire. His numismatic collection, especially of Kushan
and Gupta coins, is considered the third best in the world. He
also had a good and large collection of works of art and historical
importance. Singhiji was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts
(London), a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, the
Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the Indian Research Institute and a
Founder-Member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He was also the
President of the Jain Swetambara Conference held in Bombay
in 1926. Though he had made no special study of law he was well
up in the legal matters. On one occasion when he found that his
lawyers were not properly representing his case he himself
pleaded out the case successfully, much to the surprise of the
bench and the bar who took him for an accomplished advocate.
Though a highly religious and leading figure in the Jain
community he had an outlook which was far from sectarian.
More than three fourths of the six lakhs and over of his donations
were for non-Jain causes. More often than not he preferred to
give his assistance anonymously and he did not keep a list of his
donations even when they were made in his name. To the
Chittaranjan Seva Sadan Calcutta, he gave Rs. 10,000/-, when
Mahatmaji had been to his place for the collection of funds; to
the Hindu Academy, Daulatpur, Rs. 15,000/-, to the Taraqi-Urdu
Bangala 5000/-, the Hindi Sahitya Parishad 12,500/- to the Vishud-
dhanand Sarasvati Marwari Hospital 10,000/-, to several maternity
homes 2,500/-, to thc Benares Hindu University 2,500/-, to the
Jiaganj High School 5,000/-, to the Jiaganj London Mission
Hospital 6,000/-, to the Jain Temples at Calcutta and Murshidabad
11,000/-, to the Jain Dharma Pracharak Sabha Manbhum 5,000/-,
to the Jain Bhavan, Calcutta, 15,000/-, to the Jain Pustak Prachar
Mandal, Agra, 7,500/-, to the Agra Jain Temple 3,500/-, to the
Ambala Jain High School, 2,100/-, for the Prakrit Kosh 2,500/-,
and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 10,000/-. At the Singhi Park
Mela held at his Ballyganj residence in which Viscount Wavell,
then Commander-in-Chief and Lord John Herbert, Governor of
Bengal and Lady Herbert participated, he donated Rs. 41,000/- for
the Red Cross Fund.
The people of the district of Murshidabad, his native place,
will ever remain grateful to him for having distributed several
thousand maunds of rice at the low price of Rs. 8/- when rice was
selling at Rs. 24/- in those terrible years of 1942-52, himself
thereby suffering a loss of over three lakhs. In May-June 1944
-in-Chief ansidence in which tvihe Singhi Park

he again spent Rs. 50,000/- for the distribution of cloth, rice and
coins for the people of that place.
My close association with Singhiji began in 1931, when he
invited me to occupy the Chair for Jain Studies which he was
starting at the Vishvabharati. Due to unfavourable climatic con-
ditions of Shantiniketan I could not continue to work there for
more than four years, but during those years was founded the
Singhi Jain Series. During the period of ten years of my princi-
palship of Gujarat Puratattva Mandir, Ahmedabad, and even
before that I had been collecting materials of historical and
philological importance and folk-lore etc. which had been lying
hidden in the great Jain Bhandars of Patan, Ahmedabad, Baroda
etc. I persuaded Singhiji to start a series which would publish
works dealing with the vast materials in my possession, and also
other important Jain texts and studies prepared on the most
modern scientific lines. On the works of the Series he spent
through me more than Rs. 75,000/-. During this long period of
over a dozen years he not even once asked me as to how and for
what works the amount was spent. Whenever the account was
submitted he did not ask for even the least information, but
sanctioned it casting merely a formal glance on the accounts sheets.
But he showed the most discriminating interest in the matter that
was being published and on the material and manner in which
they were being brought out. His only desire was to see the
publication of as many works as possible during his lifetime. In
May 1943 at my instance he gave over the Series to the Bharatiya
Vidya Bhavan. In September 1943 I had been to Calcutta to
negotiate the purchase, for the Bhavan, of a well-equipped library
of a retired professor. Singhiji casually asked me what arrange-
ments had been made for meeting the cost. I promptly replied
that there was no cause for worry as long as donors like himself
were there. He smiled; he had decided. Eventually he persuad-
ed me to go in for the Nahar Collection which was a still more
valuable one. He did not live long enough to present this literary
treasure to the Bhavan; but his eldest son and my beloved friend,
Babu Shri Rajendra Singh has fulfilled his father's wish though
he was totally ignorant of it and has got this unique collection for
the Bhavan and spent Rs. 50,000/- for the purpose.
By the end of 1943 his health began to decline. In the first
week of January, 1944, when I went to him at Calcutta in connec-
tion with the work of the Bharatiya Itihasa Samiti I found him
extremely unwell. Notwithstanding his ill-health he talked to me
for more than a couple of hours on the day of my arrival there.
The first thing he said in the course of this lengthy, though very

Page 17****************************************************************************************
IV
sweet talk, was to give me a mild reproof for undertaking the
long and tedious journeys to Calcutta, Benaras and Cawnpore in
spite of my ill health. He discussed with absorbing interest the
details of the Samiti's proposed History of India, a subject of
great interest to him. Our talks then driſted to the subject of the
History of Jainism in which connection also he expressed his
opinion about the material to be utilised for such a work. At the
termination of our talks, which this time lasted for over three
hours, I found him much exhausted and drooping in spirits.
On the 7th January his health took a turn for the worse. On
11th January I went to take leave of him, which he, full of emo-
tion, gave with a heavy heart, exclaiming “Who knows whether we
shall meet again or not?” I requested him to take heart and
remain buoyant. He would be soon restored to normal health.
But while I was stepping out of his room, my eyes were full of
tears and his last words began to eat into my heart. Ill-luck
prevented our second meeting. That lofty and generous soul
finally left its mortal habitat at mid-day on 7th July, 1944. May
his soul rest in peace !
His sons, Babu Rajendra Singh, Babu Narendra Singh and
Babu Virendra Singh are treading in the footsteps of their revered
father. During the past year on the Singhi Series alone they have
spent over Rs. 20,000/-. I have already mentioned how Babu
Rajendra Singh purchased for the Bhavan the valuable Nahar
collection. Babu Narendra Singh has also spent Rs. 30,000/- for
a foundation of a Jain Bhavan at Calcutta. Babu Rajendra Singh
and Babu Narendra Singh have also very generously promised me
to continue to meet all the cxpenses of the Singhi Jain Series and
requested me to bring out as many works as possible, at whatever
cost so that this unique series founded and cherished by their late
lamented father may continue to bring to light the invaluable
treasures of Jain literature and culture.
In recognition of his unique assistance the Bharatiya Vidya
Bhavan has decided to perpetuate Singhiji's memory by naming
its Indological library after him. Further, one of its main halls
will bear his name. The Bhavan's Jain Department will also be
known as the Singhi Jain Shiksbapith.*

GENERAL EDITOR'S FOREWORD
I am very happy to present to the world of scholars Vol. II of
Prof. P. K. Gode's “ Studies in Indian Literary History”, which
is being published as the fifth volume of Shrī Bahadur Singhji
Singhi Memorial Series established in the sacred memory of my
esteemed friend the late Bābu Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi,
the noble founder of the Singhi Jain Series.
The present volume is a continuation of Vol. I of Prof.
Gode's Studies, which I had the pleasure to keep before the scho-
lars assembled at the session of the All-India Oriental Conference
held at Ahmedabad from 30th October to 1st November 1953. In
my Foreword to Vol. I of these studies I have duly indicated
the reference value of Prof. Gode's articles both on the literary
history and the cultural history of India and the necessity of
publishing all of them in a book-form with exhaustive Indices of
the type published by me in the two volumes of his studies now
appearing in the Singhi Jain Series. I feel confident that the Com-
mittee of scholars formed in July 1951 for the express purpose of
collecting funds for the publication of the remaining volumes of
Prof. Gode's Studies will get the necessary financial support from
all scholars and learned bodies to enable the Committee to publish
these volumes expeditiously under the editorial care of Prof.
Gode himself.
In bringing out the two volumes of Prof. Gode's Studies in
tha Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi Memorial Series I feel doubly
happy as these volumes not only enrich this Series, which com-
memorates the name and fame of my noble friend the late Shri
Bahādur Singhji Singhi, but provide a dependable compass to all
new explorers in the field of Indian literary history. Prof. Gode's
researches in the history and chronology of Sanskrit and Prakrit
works have given a direct stimulus to the critical editing of some
of these works. While studying the history of an author and his
works Prof. Gode lays bare all available manuscript material
pertaining to these works. Any scholar, who is interested in the
critical editing of unpublished texts, can examine this manuscript
material and choose some work or works for critical editing. The
history and chronology of the selected text and its author which
are required for his Introduction will be found ready made in Prof.
Gode's piper on the pertinent author and his works. Apart from
this aid to the critical editing of texts rendered by Prof. Gode's

Page 19****************************************************************************************
(ii)
papers on literary history every historian of Sanskrit literature
will have to recognise their direct service to the cause of the
history of Sanskrit literature as observed by the late Dr. A. B.
Keith in one of his letters to Prof. Gode. The writing and publi-
cation of more than 250 research papers of acknowledged merit in
the field of Sanskrit literary history alone speaks volumes for
Prof. Gode's firm devotion to Sarasvati, which has been the main
stay of his life and sustained literary activity of more than 37
years. It is the firm conviction of Prof. Gode that no comprehen-
sive history of Sanskrit and Prakrit literature can be written un-
less the history of every author and his works in this ficld is
proved and recorded. I fully endorse this conviction and wish
Prof. Gode long life and plenty of energy to continue his studies
in the fields of literary and cultural history of India. The details
of the technique of productive research developed by Prof. Gode
will be found in his Introduction to Vol. I of his studies. Indepe-
ndence of thought and judgment characterises all the writings of
Prof. Gode. In fact it has been the motive force of his life and
dynamic literary activity of more than three decades. I strongly
hope that the lesson of this exemplary literary activity will not fail
to inspire the younger generation of scholars in this country to
undertake and execute new plans of research in the fields of study
selected by them.
In concluding this brief Foreword I have to convey my best
thanks to Prof. Gode for his willingness to allow me to publish
in two volumes a major part of his articles on Indian Literary
History and in particular for his arduous editing of these volumes
during the last four years. I have also to thank heartily my
esteemed friends Babu Rajendra Singh Singhi and Babu Narendra
Singh Singhi, the two worthy sons of my aifectionate friend Babu
Bahādur Singhji Singhi for their continued 'benefaction in pro-
moting the cause of the Singhi Jain Series, in which the two
volumes of Prof. Gode's writings are being published. Finally I
have to thank Shri S. R. Sardesai, the Manager of the Samarth
Bharat Press for the efficient and careful printing of these volumes
in spite of all difficulties encountered by him especially at the
commencement of the work.

POSTSCRIPT BY THE GENERAL EDITOR
volume waible difficubhich I crave Singhi
In my foreword to the first volume of Prof. Gode's Studies in
Indian Literary History ( Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi Memorial
Series No. 4) the present volume was announced as shortly forth-
coming. But due to certain unavoidable difficulties of the press,
the original time schedule was disturbed, for which I crave indul.
gence of the learned admirers and eager subscribers of the Singhi
Jain Series.
possible ending to glance at Chanderis
But to-day looking at the matter from another point of view, I
rather feel that the hidden hand of the favourably disposed Dest-
iny must be at work behind that delay in the publication of this
fifth volume, and consequently instead of having a sense of regret
I am now somewhat happy about it. And here is the reason for
such a change in my reaction. It was about five weeks since I had
received from Prof. Gode the final proofs of the preliminaries of
this second volume for approval, but due to prolonged indisposi-
tion I could not attend to them. Three days back as I came to
Bombay from my peaceful forest resort at Chanderia, I brought
these proofs with me, intending to glance through them and return
them as early as possible. Accordingly to-day while I was taking
them up, quite casually I happened to throw a glance at the calendar.
It was the seventh of July! And instantly sad memories welled
up in my mind. From the very first sentence of the biographical
sketch of Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi given by me a few pages
further, the reader will find that the seventh of July is the day of
passing away of that noble friend of mine and a day of mourning and
sorrow for me. It was on the seventh of July 1944 that that noble
soul's journey through this mortal world ended and he left for
that divine abode from where nobody ever returns. And since
that day ten years have rolled down imperceptibly as it were !
To-day is Singhīji's tenth anniversary.
Every time on his anniversary, I am in the habit of praying for
the great soul or of putting on record my loving reminiscences
of him and in some such way I keep green his sacred memory.
To-day over and above offering the usual inner prayer for him, I
am getting this quite unexpected opportunity of penning these
few lines by way of dedication in this fifth volume that comme-
morates his name. And hence, as I said at the outset, I feel that
the little delay in publishing the present volume has been amply
compensated. It looks as if some hidden purpose was working to

Page 21****************************************************************************************
(iv)
bring about this welcome coincidence of the appearance of the
fifth volume of the memorial series just on the tenth anniversary
of Singhīji.
As I have stated elsewhere my original design was to publish
such a memorial volume every year, but who can hope to have
every one of his designs fulfilled ? Man has to cultivate the spirit
of resignation. Accordingly also so far as the future continuation
of this memorial series is concerned, I cannot hope, expect or
presume anything with a semblance of definiteness. For the body
that has stood me in good stead continuously for the last twenty-
five years in shouldering the General Editorship of the Singhi
Jain Series, now feels weary. The journey's end appears nearing.
I feel, therefore, little inclination for any fresh undertaking. The
work of editing several other texts in the Singhi Jain Series still
stands at various stages of completion. To see the successful
end of that task before the end of this liſe would provide the last
satisfaction of having fulfilled a long cherished desire.

INTRODUCTION
On the Vijaya-Daśami day ( 17th October 1953) the printing
of Vol. I of my Studies in Indian Literary History was completed
by the Samarth Bharat Press and some copies of it were sent by
me to Muni Shri Jinavijayaji at Ahmedabad, where a session of
the All-India Oriental Conference was held from 30th October to
1st November 1953. The publication of this volume along with
that of other volumes in the Singhi Jain Series was announced at this
Session and scholars assembled at Ahmedabad had an occasion to
see the completed volume after my labour on it for the last four
years. In Muniji's Foreword to this volume he has referred to
the printing of Vol. II of my Studies in Literary History. This
volume could not be released on the Vijaya-Daśami day as the
printing of the Indices to it was not then completed. This print-
ing has now been finished and I have great pleasure in presenting
it to the world of scholars with all its short-comings for which I
crave the indulgence of the learned readers.
In the selection of articles reprinted in the present volume,
I could not follow the relative chronological order which I have
generally followed in the first volume as the offprints of all my
papers on Literary History were not available with me. The
editors of some of the journals and volumes, in which these
articles originally appeared, were not able to supply me any off-
prints of my articles published by them especially during the
period of the world-war. The first volume contains articles on
authors and their works from about A. D. 500 to A. D. 1300. The
second voluine contains articles on authors and their works bet-
ween c. A.D. 1200 and 1803. This is a broad plan adopted by me
for the reprinting of my articles in the two volumes. The ex-
haustive Indices to these volumes prepared by my friends Dr. A.
D. Pusalkar and Prof. N. A. Gore enhance the reference value of
these volumes and I record here my most grateful thanks to them
for their labour of love spent so ungrudgingly in the preparation
of these Indices, a work of considerable merit and importance
for research students in the field of Indian literary history. I
myself hope to benefit by this labour in my future studies in this
field.
The present volume is a continuation of Vol. I of my studies.
The two volumes together comprise more than 1000 pages of my
research output out of a total of about 3500 pages so far

knal friend the near 1951 ay
published by me in the form of articles during the last 37
years. In his kind Foreword to Vol. I of my Studies, Muni Shri
Jinavijayaji has expressed a hope that the remaining volumes of
my studies in Indian Literary and Cultural History excluding the
articles in the two volumes kindly published by him in the Singhi
Jain Series as an act of personal friendship, will be brought out
by my friends and leirned bodies in the near future. In this
connection I am happy to announce that in July 1951 a Committee
was formed in Poona with the express purpose of collecting funds
for the publication of my writings in a book-form with Principal
J. R. Gharpure, B. A., LL. B., as President, Dr. R. N. Dandekar,
M.A., Ph.D., as Treasurer and Professors Dr. A. D. Pusalkar, M.A.,
LL.B., Ph.D., and N. A. Gore, M.A. as Joint-Secretaries. This
Committee has collected some money and about six months ago
the work of printing Vol. III of my Studies in Indian Literary
History was started in right earnest. The Committee hopes to bring
out this volume as early as possible. I cannot adequately express
mysense of gratitude to all the members of this Committee for
their appreciation of my humble work in the field of Indology
coupled with an intense desire to put it in a permanent book-form.
. With the publication of the present volume I complete hap-
pily my promise to Muni Shri Jinavijayaji about an expeditious
editing of the two volumes, which he undertook to publish in the
Singhi Jain Series some years ago. This meritorious and
brotherly undertaking of Muniji has proved to be the auspicious
harbinger of a further undertaking in this line as I have indicated
above. But for the self-less and enlightened editorship of Muniji
the Singhi Jain Series, in which the two volumes of my studies
appear, would not have made its present distinguished progress,
which owes so much to the pious liberality of the late Babu Baha-
dur Singh Singhi, the noble and illustrious founder of this series,
who was noted throughout his life for his great love of learning
coupled with a broad outlook on life and literature. It is a
pleasure to find his two worthy sons BABU RAJENDRA SINGH
SINGHI and BABU NARENDRA SINGH SINGHI upholding
their revered father's renown and carrying out his pious wishes in
promoting the sacred cause of the Singhi Jain Series with their
unstinted benefaction and co-operation. I cannot adequately ex-
press my sense of gratitude to my esteemed friend MUNI SHRI
JINAVIJAYAJI and BABU SHRI RAJENDRA SINGH SINGHI
and BABU SHRI NARENDRA SINGH SINGHI for the
publication of the two volumes of my studies in the Singhi Jain
Series, which by its numerous and varied publications has
endeared itself to Indologists all over the world.

R. G. Bbwed the tradif acknowlederations or c
In the Introduction to Vol. I of my studies I have indicated
clearly the method followed by me in my studies as also their
nature and limitations. The fields of study explored by me need
many more explorers better equipped with the means of research
than myself. I shall feel amply rewarded if my labour of more
than 36 years in the fields of Indian literary and cultural history
creates in the minds of the younger scholars an intense desire to
carry on unbroken lifelong research in these fields. Indology
needs at present no dilettante and slip-shod research but devoted
and sustained work by genuine lovers of research in the fields
selected by them. The taper of research temporarily lighted in
the Post-graduate classes of our Universities but extinguished
with the acquisition of a degree cannot illumine the path of
Indology. Prize-winners in our Universities appear and disappear
every year. Very few of them follow the academic traditions of
reputed scholars of the previous generations or create any tradi.
tions by their own work of acknowledged merit. In my own work
I have followed the traditions of scholars in our province like
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar, Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, Dr. P. V. Kane and
others, who in their respective fields of study have done
monumental and exemplary work worthy of our reverence and
admiration.
In the Introduction to Vol. I of my studies I have thanked all
my friends at the B. O. R. Institute and outside, whose goodwill
and co-operation have facilitated my studies in diverse ways. It
is, therefore, needless to thank all these friends individually in
this brief Introduction. I hope, however, to enjoy their goodwill
and co-operation in the same manner as hitherto. In conclusion
I have to thank Shri S. R. Sardesai and Shri V. V. Patankar of the
Samarth Bharat Press for the efficient printing of the present
volume and Shri. S. N. Savadi and Shri G. N. Shrigondekar of
the B. O. R. Institute for their help in seeing this volume through
the press. In particular their unstinted help in the correction of
the proofs of the Indices to both the volumes of my studies
deserves my special thanks.
The first volume of my studies is dedicated fittingly
to my Guru the late Dr. P. D. GUNE and his affectionate
friend and my friend and benefactor MUNI SHRI JINA-
VIJAYAJI. The present volume is dedicated to the loving
memory of my parents and sisters to whom I owe my entire
being as they carried out my entire school and college education
at great sacrifice to themselves.

1. Oldest dated Manuscript of Sāyana's
Commentary on the Sāmaveda*
While examining the manuscripts in che Limaye collection'
acquired by the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, in 1938, I found in it a
Ms of the Samavedärthaprakāśa by the celebrated Sāyaṇācārya. It
consists of about 235 folios ( size - 11} in. x 5 in.) and is written
on thick country paper, which though old is well preserved. I was
particularly interested in this Mså because of its early date of
copying which is recorded on the last folio 235 in the following
colophon:
____" इति श्रीमद्राजाधिराजपरमेश्वरवैदिकमार्गप्रवर्तकश्रीवीरबुलभूपालसाम्राज्यधुरंधरेण
सायणाचार्येण विरचिते माधवीये सामवेदार्थप्रकाशे उत्तरा प्रथे एकविंशोध्यायः ॥
॥छ । संवत् १५२० वर्षे चैष शुग गुरौलिखितं ।। शुभं भवत ॥ छ॥"
* Annals ( B. O. R. Institute ), XX, pp. 145–152.
1. This collection was presented to the Institute by Mr. Sham-
bhurao Govind Limaye of Aşte ( Satara Dist.). It contains about 450
Mss. An ancestor of Mr. Limaye of the name Sakho Anant Limaye,
who flourished between A. D. 1800 and 1840 had a passion for col.
lecting Mss. He was in the employ of Mahadevabhat Patvardhan,
the son of Parashurambhau Patvardhan, the renowned ancestor of the
Raja of Sangli. He appears to have been a Phadanis or Finance Sec.
retary of Mahadevabhat Patvardhan as he is called in the colophone
of somc of the Mss in the «Limaye collection as “Sakhopant Limay
Astekar Phadapis." Váñcheśvara alias Kuțţi Kavi composed his
commentary on the Hiranya kesisütra at the desire of Sakhopant
Limaye between A, D. 1816 and 1828 ( Vide my article on Kutti
Kavi, Annals Vol. XX, pp. 9-20). It is remarkable that Sakhopant
Limaye maintained his interest in Sanskrit learning in tact inspite of
the demolition of the Maratha Empire that was then taking place
between 1800 and 1840 A. D.
2 This Ms contains Sayane's commontary on the Uttardret
of the Samaveda ( 21 chapters ). The colophons of the several
adhyayas will be found on folios 13, 24, 34, 50, 63, 75, 89, 99, 112,
126, 134, 147, 158, 165, 172, 182, 188, 196, 210, 228, 235. The date

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The above colophon agrees with the colophons in the edition
of this work published in the Bibliotheca Indica.' The Mss used
for this edition are briefly mentioned by the editor in his Sanskrit
Introduction to Vol. V of this Edition. He does not, however,
record any dates of the Mss used by him. I have no means of
examining the Ms material used for the other editions of this work
referred to in the British Museum Catalogue.' It appears, however,
that the Mss of Sāyaṇa's commentary on the Sāmaveda are not
numerous. Aufrecht records about 16 Mss in his Catalogus Cata-
logorum viz. Part 1, P. 709 -Io. 1283, 300, 3005* Khn. 2, Ben. 16,17,
( Continued from the previous page)
of this Ms as found recorded in the colophon quoted above
would be equivalent to Thursday, 31st March 1463 A.D. (Vide
Indian Ephemeris, V, p. 128). The tithi and the week_day recorded
in the Ms read "I 9 TET" which ought to read "I 99 TTT" as "19"
would give us Monday 21st March 1463, while “ 99” gives us
Thursday, 31st March 1463. Evidently the writing of "q" for "99"
and" TET" for" dit is due to scribal error.

OLDEST DATED MS OF SAMAVEDARTHAPRAKASA

II, p. 283 - Ulwar“ 223, 226. Out of the above Mss I have
examined about ten as described in Catalogues and find that no
dates for them are recorded in their descriptions. The Berlin Ms
represented by Aufrecht's entry “W. 1424 " is dated Saka 1772 =
A. D. 1850 and hence has no chronological value. The remaining
four Mes viz. Khn. 2. Ben. 16. 17, Brl. 40 and Rice 62 are not
available to me and hence I am unable to say if any of them bear
any dates. Judging, however, by the paucity of the Mss of Sāyana's
commentary on the Sāmaveda and also the paucity of early dates
for these Mss I am inclined to think that the Ms of the Limaye
collection bearing the date Saṁvat 1520 or A. D. 1463 is the oldest
dated Ms of the Samavedārthaprakāśa of Sāyaṇa and as such should
be extremely useful to scholars interested in a critical edition of
this commentary."
It would now be useful to record the dates of Mss of Sayana's
commentary on the Rgveda. Fortunately my friend Mr. N. S.
Sontakke, the Editor of the Poona Edition of the ægveda has done
this work to some extent. He gives us a detailed account of the
Mss procured by him for his edition. The following tabular state-
ment will show clearly the chronology of the dated Mss used by
Mr. Sontakke :-
----

115 - No date recorded.
2. Report II (1884) by Peterson, p. 178 - No date recorded.
This Ms is from the list of Ulwar Mss.
3. Weber's Cata. of Berlin Mss, 1886, p. 16 – Ms No. 1424,
dated Saka 1772 = A. D. 1850.

though No. 225, the text of Sämavedasamhita, is dated Samvat 1675 =
A. D. 1619).
5. Mr. M. M. Patkar of the B. 0. R. Institute has prepared a
specimen list of variants ( Vide Appendix ) as found in this Ms after
comparing it with the text of Sayana's commentary on the Samaveda
as published in the Bibliotheca Indica edition of 1874-78. From
these variants collected by him from this Ms for Chap. I, of
Uttararci - commentary, it appears that they materially differ from
those in the Bib Ind. Edition.

2. Texts sanctioning the Study of Yoga by
Women and their Chronology*
Brahmānanda, the author of the commentary Fyotsna on the
Hathayogapradipikā of Svātmārāma yogi gives the following opinion
of the sage Matarga', which supports among other things the
study of Yoga by women :-
" महर्षिमाता :-
'अनिष्टोमादिकान्सर्वान्विहाय द्विजसत्तमः ।
योगाभ्यासरतः शान्तः परं ब्रह्माधिगच्छति ॥
ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां स्त्रीशूद्राणां च पावनम् ।
शान्तये कर्मणामन्यद्योगामास्ति विमुक्तये ॥"
he Govt. Mss Ppears on folio 3 for watt; and
I have traced this quotation given by Brahmānanda in a work
called Yogacintamani composed by the Royal Preceptor or Rāja-
guru of Gajapati Prataparudradeva' of Orissa (A. D. 1497-1539) with
the following variants:-मतमः for मातङ्गः ; यज्ञान् for सर्वान् ; and शूद्रस्य
for शूद्राणां. This quotation appears on folio 3 of a MS of the Yoga-
cintamani in the Govt. MSS Library at the Bhandarkar Institute,
Poona (No. 220 of 1882-83). This fact makes it clear that the
Jyotsna knew the work Yogacintămani of Godāvaramiśra as we find
it in a MS form. The following references in the Jyotsnä сorro.
borate our conclusion :-
Page 12
"भत्र योगचिन्तामणिकाराः पद्यपि
'बामणक्षत्रियविशां स्त्रीशद्राणां च पावनं । शान्तये कर्मणामन्ययोगानास्ति विमु-
कये' इत्यादि पुराणवाक्येषु प्राणिमात्रस्य योगेऽधिकार उपलभ्यते तथापि मोक्षरूपक
फलं योगविरक्तस्यैव भवति । " etc.
The above reference is important as it gives the name of the
work from which the extract is taken and criticized, besides men-
tioning the opinion of sage Matanga traced by me in a MS of the
Yogacintamani.

“gla ferataratai Fareri Hà afe" (Possibly offerat for is
meant in the expression 'चिन्तामणेर्वाक्यं ').
Then again the following verse which I have found on folio 15
of the B. O. R. Institute MS of the Yogacintamani referred to
above is also found in the Jyotsnä on p..175 of the printed edition
without any variants :
"मैत्रेयी सुलभा शाी शांडिलीच तपस्विनी।
स्त्रीत्वे प्राप्ता परां सिद्धिमन्यजन्मसमाधितः ॥"
The above evidence is sufficient to establish the mutual chrono-
logical relation of the Jyotsnā and the Yogacintāmaņi of Godāvara
Miśra. Though Jyotsna is a very late commentary, the antiquity
of sage Matanga's opinion sanctioning the study of Yoga by women
is proved in the first instance owing to its being quoted by the
author of the Yogacintamani 400 years back and secondly owing to
the fact of this sage Matanga being quoted with some respect as
an ancient authority on the question.
We have tried to trace the above verses quoted by the Jyot-
sna in the MS of the Yogacintamani of Godāvaramiśra because Shri
Yogendra has referred to this commentary on the Hathayogapra.
dipikā as one of the authorities supporting the study of Yoga by
women. We have shown in an Appendix to this article that this
commentary is quite modern. In fact the references to and
quotations from the Yogacintāmaņi and numerous other works
show the modern character of the composition of the commentary.
It is, however, useful to enable us to understand the Yoga practices
current or known in Brahmānanda's time.
Before we proceed to consider other authorities in support of
the study of Yoga by women we must distinguish the work Yoga-
cintamani of Godāvaramiéra from another work of the same name,
viz, the Yogacintamani of Harsakirtisūri, the pupil of Candra-
kirtisūri. This latter work is purely a treatise on medicine and
has nothing to do with Yoga. The Jain Sûri Candrakirti belong-
ed to the Nāgapura Tapāgaccha and was contemporary of Salem

TEXTS SANCTIONING STUDY OF YOGA BY WOMEN
Shah who was Emperor of Delhi between 1545 and 1553 A. D.'
Candrakīrti was the author of a commentary on the Sarasvata-
prakriya of Anubhūtisvarūpācārya. It appears, therefore, that
Godāvaramiśra wrote his work Yogacintāmaņi (on Yoga ) between
A. D. 1497 and 1539 while Harşakirti wrote his work Yogacinta-
mani ( on Medicine ) ? say after 1550 A. D. or in the 3rd quarter of
the 16th century. It mentions a preparation against phirangaroga
or venereal disease (p. 277, verse 346 ). This reference to
phir angaroga corroborates Sir P. C. Ray's statement in his History
of Hindu Chemistry (Vol. I, Intro. p. 1 ) that this' disease of the
Portuguese' was introduced into India about the middle of the
16th century, i.e. about 1550 A. D.
Among the other authorities quoted by Shri Yogendra on the
question at issue is the Yogasārasaṁgraha of Vijñānabhikṣu, accord-
ing to which the path of Yoga is disclosed mainly to the grhastha or
householder (vide p. 184 of Yoga Personal Hygiene). According to
Winternitz (G. I. L. Vol. III, p. 457 ) this writer flourished in the
2nd half of the 16th century, i. e. between A. D. 1550 and 1600.
Prof. Keith, however, gives a date for this author which is quite
late. He states that Vijñānabhikṣu wrote about 1650 A. D.3 It will
thus be seen that the difference between the dates of Godāvara
Misra and Vijñānabhikṣu, who wrote the Yogacintamani and the
Yogasārasangraha respectively, varies from about 50 to 150 years
respectively. The Jyotsnā of Brahmānanda and the Yogasāra-
sangraha of Vijñānabhikṣu are divided by a difference of about 300
years if we take Winternitz's date of Vijñānabhikṣu to be
correct. The chronological order of the three works would, there.
fore, be as follows :- (1) Yogacintamani of Godāvara Miśra
( between 1497 and 1539 A. D. ), (2) Yogasārasaṁgraha of Vijñāna-
bhikṣu ( between 1550 and 1600 A. D., ) and (3) Fyotsna of
Brahmānanda ( between 1850 and 1875 A. D.). The above autho-

rities though quite late are sufficient to prove how the reaction
against the prejudices of Brahmanism about continence or brahma-
carya as the condition precedent for an efficacious study and prac.
tice of Yoga was completed gradually.
The Hathayogapradipikå of Svātmārāma Yogi maintains, how-
ever, its Brahmanical predilections in favour of brahmacarya. Com-
pare the following passages and contrast them with Vijñāna-
bhikṣu's opinion cited above, viz., that the path of Yoga is dis-
closed only to the grhastha or householder :-
Page 151-
" dicapta fari feaffarga: 1
मण्डलाद् दृश्यते सिद्धिः कुण्डष्यभ्यासयोगिनः ॥"
Page 137-
" चित्तायत्तं नृणां शुक्रं शुक्रायत्तं च जीवितम् ।
तस्माच्छुकं मनश्चैव रक्षणीयं प्रयत्नतः ॥"
It appears to us from the foregoing passages in the Hatha.
yogapradipikā of Svātmārāma Yogi that its author has not shaken
off his Brahmanical inclinations characteristic of some of the
Smộtis in the matter of the importance of brahmacarya.
The Jyotsnä quotes very often another authority, viz., a work
on Yoga called Yogabija (vide Appendix ). According to this
authority Yoga can be practised both by males as well as females.'
We have not examined the antiquity or chronology of this text but
will do so on a later occasion. As regards the passage from the
Mahābhārata quoted by Jyotsnä in support of its opinion we may
observe that the text of the Great Epic varies in its antiquity in
its different portions and hence no definite conclusion about the
antiquity of a single passage can be arrived at with any claim to
certainty.

Brahmānanda gives us in the following introductory verses
the purpose with which the commentary was written by him :-
"गुरुं नत्वा शिवं साक्षाब्रह्मानन्देन तन्यते ।
हठप्रदीपिकाज्योत्स्ना योगमार्गप्रकाशिका ॥
इदानींतनानां सुबोधार्थमस्याः
सुविज्ञायगोरक्षसिद्धान्तहार्दम् ।
मया मेरुशास्त्रिप्रमुख्याभियोगात्
स्फुटं कथ्यतेऽत्यन्तगूढोऽपिभावः ॥"
It appears from these verses that Brahmānanda was a disciple
of one Meruśāstri. We also learn from Aufrecht's Catalogus
Catalogorum ( Part I, p. 388b) that this मेरुशास्त्रिन् was alive in 1859,
A. D. and that Brahmananda wrote other works also, viz :-
(1) त्रिपुरार्चनरहस्य ( compare त्रिपुरासारसमुच्चय in the above list);
(2) आनंदलहरीटीका भावार्थदीपिका; (3) शाक्तानंदतरंगिणी and (4) षट्-
चक्रदीपिका.
It appears that he was a devotee of Siva as he makes an
offering of the Jyotsnã commentary to this God in the following
verse at the end of the commentary :-
"सदर्थयोतनकरी तमःस्तोमविनाशिनी।
ब्रह्मानन्देन ज्योत्स्नेयं शिवाघ्रियुगुलेर्पिता ॥२॥"

Page 45****************************************************************************************
STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Aufrecht puts a work called Hathapradipamañjari against the
name of Merušāstrin in his catalogue ( Cat. Cata. part I, p. 467a ).
I have identified the reference to Jñāneśvara's commentary on
Chapter VI of the Gītā made by Brahmānanda in his Jyotsna in the
following lines :
P. 73. — " papa FUTETT at PÀTEAM TOURTANT:
Fagråa afara" - This is a Sanskrit paraphrase of the Ovis in
Marathi by Jñāneśvara, viz., 208, 209 and 210 of Chapter VI. Mr.
M. P. Oka in his tras (1929) translates ovi 210 as under ;--
" स्वाधिष्ठानोपरिप्रान्ते नाभिस्थानतले च यः।
बन्धो भवति तं पार्थ विदुराकर्षणाभिधम् ॥ २१०॥"
As regards Yogabīja mentioned by Brahmānanda in the Jyot-
snā Aufrecht (Cata. Cata. I, 477 ) records three MSS of the work,
viz., (1 ) Bik. 570; (2) Radh. 28 ;(3); N. W. 424. The Bikaner
Catalogue of MSS on p. 370 describes its MS of Yogabīja as
under:-“No. 1233 — ( 10 folios ). A summary of the rules of con-
duct to be observed by yogis. It is ascribed to the God Isvara or
Siva. It may be a part of a Purāņa.'

Page 46****************************************************************************************
3. Date of Sarasvatapradipa of Bhatta
Dhanesvara*
aprakriyā by Bhatt af 1887-91 in the Govat 1653(“:
Aufrecht' refers to only one MS of a commentary on the
Sarasvataprakriyā by Bhatta Dhanesvara viz. “Bd. 555." This
MS is the same as No. 555 of 1887-91 in the Govt. MSS Library at
the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. It is dated Samvat 1653 ("संवत् १६५३
वर्षे अश्विनमासे शुक्लपक्षे अष्टम्यां तिथौ रविवासरे") which corresponds to
20th September 1596 A. D. The MS consists of 68 folios, the first
2 folios having been lost previous to its acquisition in 1887.
About this commentator Dr. Belvalkar' remarks :-" Dhane-
śvara — He wrote his commentary with the avowed object of
correcting Kshemendra. As a consequence he comes after Kshe-
mendra and belore 1595 A. D. when one of the MSS of Dhane-
svara's commentary was copied. He has written as mentioned in
the praśasti of five stanzas at the end of the area section of the
commentary, a tīkā on the Mahābhāşya called Chintāmaņi, a new
grammar for beginners called Prakriyāmaņi and a commentary on
a stotra from the Padmapurāņa."
Obviously the passage referred to by Dr. Belvalkar con-
taining the names of the works written by Dhanesvara appears as
under on folio 39 of the MS in question :--
" यश्च व्याकरणं चक्रे धनेश प्रक्रियामाणि-
नाना नूतनमुद्रोधं बालानां कर्तुमुन्मनाः॥
योनभूतिः कृतस्यात्र टिप्पणं दोष चनं

यस्य कौशिकगोचे यः शेषनागं च जन्मना।
गुरुं चक्रेध्ययन तस्थेन कोत्र समो भवेत् ॥५॥"
On folio 15 Dhaneśvara refers to himself in the following
manner :-
" इति श्रीमहाभाष्यकृतशेषनाग' कुलदैवतपंडितधनेश्वर"
an expression which is analogous to the purport of verse 5 in the
above extract. Am is apparently the name of the author of
महाभाष्य commonly ascribed to पतञ्जलि.' Dhanesvara's gotra
appears to be arrate as stated in verse 5. In the colophon on
folio 3 he calls himself by such epithets as " वैयाकरणगजेन्द्रसिंह"
and "न्यायशास्त्रपारंगत." His proficiency in grammar is sufficiently
vouched by the present commentary. As regards his mastery of
the FUTUTTE we are sufficiently acquainted with it on folio 31, where
he refers to the पक्षधर्मतावाद of the “चिंतामणि अनुमानखंड", which
is obviously a reference to गंगेश's तत्वचिंतामणि, assigned to
c. 1200 A. D.
Dhaneśvara refers to the following works and authors in his
present commentary :
1. चिंतामणि अनुमानखंड --- fol. 31.
2. पीतांबर -- fol. 34, 36, 14, 27, 33. 37.

elementary grammar based on Kramadīśvara's Sankṣiptasära and
(2) Châtravyutpatti, a versified abstract of Rāmāyana in nine
Sargas exemplifying the verse-section of Sārasaṁgraha. Possibly
Dhaneśvara may be referring to either of tiese two works of
Pītāmbara. On folio 34 of the present MS he refers to a disciple
of matar as having copied the present commentary for the
author :-“sa treaca tratiama antaggiù a pratatrices
Postera Faria: gron: fiqori: " If this statement is correct we may
presume intarer goes to be a contemporary of Dhaneśvara and in
that case we shall have to suppose that aihi was an elder
contemporary of Dhaneſyara. But these conclusions need to be
corroborated by other independent evidence.
The reference to "Hotah:(No. 4 in the above list ) is
very important for purposes of fixing the limits for Dhaneśvara's
date. From the five references to TrHari noted by me, I have
identified that on folio 41, where Dhaneśvara refers to Rāmacan.
drācārya as under :-"sa para tratar AUTT Tihantal-
fest." This quotation is found on page 34 of Vol. II of the
Prakriyakaumudi ( Bombay Sanskrit Series Edition, published by
the B. O. R. Institute in 1931 ). Mr. K. P. Trivedi, the editor of
this work, assigns Rāmacandra to "the latter half of the 14th
Centurya " i. e. between A. D. 1350 and 1400. The present MS of
Dhanesvara's commentary is dated 1596 A. D. and hence we are
able to fix the limits for his date, which are A. D. 1400 and 1596.

These limits can be narrowed down still further because Dhanes-
vara refers in his work to FATCAIT in two places ( vide No. 13 in the
above list). We know that fago, the grandson of THO, wrote his
commentary on the sherbruet called for and evidently this
commentary is referred to by Dhanešvara in the two places pointed
out above. As the author of the TTC commentary is the grandson
of Thrones we must add at least 50 years to the date of the
to arrive at Vitthala's date, which, therefore, may be fixed at about
1450 a. D. and as Dhaneśvara quotes the percre as authority
a period of at least 25 years must have intervened between Dhane-
śvara and TerCATT. We may, therefore, tentatively fix A. D. 1475
as the probable earlier limit for the date of ant. Now deducting
50 years from the date of the MS Sarasvatapradipa viz. A. D. 1596
we may fix A. D. 1475 and 1546 as the probable limits of Dhane-
śvara's date or roughly we may say that he flourished in the 1st
quarter of the 16th Century. This conclusion will affect the date of
K semendrațippana, which must, therefore, be not later than the
middle of the fifteenth century.'

4. Yogacintīmaņi of Śivānanda Sarasvatī*
(AN ENCYCLOPÆDIC COMPENDIUM OF YOGA TEXTS
AND ITS CRITICAL ANALYSIS )
Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum' records the follow-
iog Manuscripts of a work on Yoga called the Yogacintamani :-
Part I-(1) Hall, p. 12; (2) L. 2538 ; (3) Khn, 58 (Com.
mentary by Haridīkşita ); (4) B. 4. 2 (5) Ben, 67 ; ( 6 ) Bik 568 ;
he also states that it is quoted by Sundaradeva (W. p. 196 ) and
that there is a commentary by Bhavānisahāya on some work of this
name (N. W. 436).
Part II -(1) Bhāu Dāji, 66, 114:(2) C. U. add. 1714 (frag.
mentary); (3) Commentary by Durgādāsa Vācaspati - Stein 132.
This work should be distinguished from other works of the
same name on medicine, by Harsakirti? ( after 1550 A.D.) and by
Dhanvantaris and from another Yogacintämani on Yoga composed
by Godāvara Miśra, who calls himself as the Rājaguru of Gajapati
Pratāparudradeya of Orissa ( a. D. 1497-1539 ) and a manuscript of
which has been preserved in the Government MSS Library at the
Bhandarkar O. R. Institutte, Poona ( No. 220 of 1882-83) and a
critical analysis of which we shall present later. In the present
article we shall deal mainly with Sivānanda's Yogacintamani which
is now available in a published form.
In the colophons of the four chapters of this work, Sivā.
nanda describes himself as the pupil of परमहंसपरिवाजकाचार्यश्रीरामचंद्र-
सदानन्दसरस्वती.
He appears to have modelled his Yogacintamani on the Yoga-

Hathayoga excluding its psychical side as elucidated in the Vedānta
texts on the one hand and the Hathayoga of the extreme type as
propounded by the Käpälikas or Leftists. The second extreme is
avoided because it is contrary to glat and Fura.
We have observed already that Sivānanda's work is a topical
compendium of Yoga texts in four chapters.' This is evidenced by
his own statement on p. 2:-
" नानाग्रंथपयोधिमध्यपतितं श्रीयोगचिन्तामणिम् ।

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
For fixing the date of the present work, the reference to
"feerregstgrer: "(item No. 46 in the above list ) furnishes us
with one terminus to Sivananda's date. This is evidently a refer-
ence to the celebrated fauttog' the brother of Sayanācārya ( about
1360 A. D.) to whom many works are assigned by Aufrecht. We
may, therefore, fix about 1450 A. D. as one terminus to the date
of Sivānanda. The other terminus to Sivānanda's date will
have to be fixed on t!e strength of references to this Yogacintā.
mani in subsequent works, some of which may be noted below:-
(1) Weber in his Catalogue of Berlin MSS. (p. 196) des.
cribes a work called हठतश्वकोमुदी by सुंदरदेव son of Govinda.
This work quotes the following works and authors on Yoga:
(1) arafor, (2) farahisar, (3) farasitar, (4) carna-
Tra, (5) apata picar, (6) TUTTU, and (7) TTH.
It is not clear which malū is meant in the above
references – whether Sivānanda's or Godāvaramiśra's. We
do not also know the date of area referred to above. If
this सुंदरदेव is identical with सुंदरदेव, the author of a work
on anthology called CT, (MS B. D. 65 described on
p. 345 of B. B. R. A. S. MSS Catalogue by Velankar,
Vol. II) then his date is between A. D. 1644 and
1710 as proved by me elsewhere. But this identity has
not yet been proved.
(2) The dates of the commentaries on the work by eftetiera
aid ''Bhavanisahāya'' referred to by Aufrecht may also
furnish us with the other terminus to Sivānanda's date
but the MSS of these commentaries are not available for
study.
(3) Brahmānanda in his commentary called Jyotsnå (T.P.H.
Edition, 1933, Adyar) p. 53, quotes from arata for as
under :-

YOGACINTAMANT OF SIVANANDA SARASVATT
This quotation is identical with the following lines on
p. 28 of fragrant's THIOT -
" अत एव प्राणायामेवाभ्यासक्रमेण प्रत्याहार-धारणा-ध्यान-समाधिशब्देन उच्यते"
(B) Another quotation for identifying the farator
quoted by Jyotsnā of Brahmānanda is the following on
p. 52 (T. P. H. Edition):--
" एतद्व्याख्यातं योगचिंतामणौ - 'निद्रावसंगतस्य पुंसो यावताकालेन एक:
श्वासः गच्छति आगच्छति च तावत्काल: प्राणायामस्थ मात्रा इति उच्यते, इति"
This quotation is identical with the following lines in fetaraaz's
umferarafo, p. 29);-
" निद्रावसंगतस्थ पुसो यावत्कालेन एकश्वासो गच्छति आगच्छति च तावत्काले
प्राणायामस्थ मात्रा इति उच्यते।"
It is, therefore, clear that the Jyotsnā is quoting from Fararaaz's
योगचिन्तामणि and not from गोदावमिश्र's as presumed by me' on the
strength of a passage "Agitaiat: Agraritara TTT...fy 7" then
found in Godāvaramiśra's intraaraa but which is also found in
Sivananda's entrata for on page 57. Evidently Sivānanda has bor-
rowed the passage from Godāvaramiśra for he has modelled his
treatise on the lines of Godāvaramióra's work as stated above.
In the foregoing critical analysis of Sivānanda's work the fol.
lowing points have been made clear:-
(1) Sivānanda's Yogacintāmaſı is an almost encyclopædic
compendium of Yoga texts affording useful literary strata
for the history of Yoga literature.
(2) Sivananda chronologically stands midway between
Godāvaramiśra (Circa 1497-1539 A, D.) on the one hand
and Brahmānanda ( about 1869 A. D.) on the other. At any
rate he flourished after A. D. 1450 in view of his reference
to" faUTTOAITTET:"
(3) Sivananda excludes like Godāvaramisra the Hathayoga?
1. Cf. Yoga, the Journal of the Yoga Institute, Bombay, Vol. III,
pp. 17-20.
2. It may be here mentioned that there really is nothing like
extreme variety of Hathayoga. The indecorous teachings and rituals
adopted by the followers of the left path (ATHATT ) or Käpälikas could

of the extreme variety which conflicts with spa and metat.
The Hathayogapradipikå of Svātmārāma Muni appears to
combine both Hathayoga and Rajayoga.
( Continued from previous page )
hardly be termed Yoga or, for that matter, Hatha yoga in any sense.
It is, therefore, unfortunate that a few indiscreet authors, old and
pew, have often misunderstood and misinterpreted the Tantra and
Saiva ritualism as a part of Hathayoga. The disa ssociation of Hatha-
yoga from such cults was continually emphasized from the earliest
poriod of the great epic ( Mahabharata ) to this day. Vide Yoga,
Vol. II, pp. 101, 102 - Ed.

5. Identification of Vīrabhānu, the Patron of
the Poet Bhānukara*
In my note in the Calcutta Oriental Journal (Vol. I, pp. 197-199)
I recorded some data for the identification of king Virabhānu, the
patron of the poet Bhānukara. Since this note appeared more evi-
dence has been forthcoming and the problem of the identification
of Virabhānu may now be regarded as well nigh settled.
Petersop' mentions a king Virabhānu of the Vaghela dynasty in
the following comments :-
“No 101 of A 1883.84 - in the present collection there is a copy
of a metrical commentary on the Sūtras of Vātsyāyana by a royal
author who fortunately gives us his date and lineage. He belonged
to the Vaghela dynasty and wrote "in the year 1633.” His name
was Virabhadra. He was the son of Ramachandra, who was the
son of Virabhānu, who was the son of Virasinha, who was the son
of Salavāhana, the founder of the line."
The genealogy indicated in the above comments is presumably
based on the following verses appearing at the beginning of M8
No 101 of A 1883-84 now in the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O.
R. Institute, Poona :-

On the strength of the genealogy recorded in the above extract
and the date of composition of this work Kandarpa-Cūdāmaņi
recorded in the colophon viz. the (Samvat) year 1633 indicated by
the chronogram "हरलोचनहरलोचनरसशशि' (फाल्गुनशुक्लप्रतिपदि) correspon-
ding to A. D. 1577 I was inclined to identify king Virabhānu with
the king Virabhanu, the patron of the poet Bhānukara, who accord.
ing to Dr. Hara Datta Sharma' was a "contemporary of Sher Shah
(1540-1545).” Accordingly I wrote to Dr. Sharma indicating the
nature of my hypothesis. In the meanwhile Dr. Hiranand Shastri,
Director of Archæology, Baroda, to whom I had sent a copy of
my note on Virabhānu was kind enough to write to me as under in
a private communication dated 15-5-35 :-
"Re. Virabhānu I draw your attention to my Memoir on the
Baghela Dynasty of Rewa which will show that this Virabhānu is
identical with the hero of the Virabhānūdcya Kävya noticed there.
This Kavya is now being published by the Rewa authorities with
my critical analysis."
I have since studied Dr. Shastri's above Memoir published in
1925 and am convinced that king Virabhānu, the patron of the poet
Bhanukara is none other than Virabhanu of the Vaghela dynasty
mentioned in Peterson's comments on the Kandarpa-Cūdāmani
composed in A. D. 1577 by Virabhānu's grandson Virabhadra. As
pointed out by Dr. Shastri this Virabhānu is identical with the hero
of the Virabhānūdaya-Käoya, the subject of his Memoir under
reference.
I am further informed by Dewan Bahadur Pandit Janaki Prasad
of Rewa that there is also a MS of a work called Viracampū bearing

on the life of Virabhānu. I hope the Rewa authorities will publish
this work and make it available to scholars.
The genealogy of Virabhānu as recorded in the extract from
the Kandarpa-Cüdāmaņi given above is only partial but is confirm-
ed by the following complete genealogy found in the Virabhânū.
daya-Kāoya and recorded by Dr. Shastri on p. 10 of his Memoir:-
(1) Bhima
(2) Rāningadeva
(3) Vālañadeva
(4) Vallaradeva

(5) Virāmadeva

(9) Virasimha

Utkala and

(10) Virabhānu
(11) Rāmachandra
(12) Virabhadra
When the edition of the Virabhanudaya Kävya is published
with Dr. Hirananda Shastri's critical analysis it will throw a food
of light on King Virabhānu and his personality. In the meanwhile
I note here some historical information from Dr. Shastri's
Memoir under reference :-
The date of the MS of the Virabhanudaya Kavya is Sarvat
1648 (= A. D. 1591). This poem consists of 12 cantos. The first
and last page of the MS are marked with scals, containing the
date of the seal viz. 965 ( = 1558). Virabhadra was at Delhi when
his father Rāmachandra died in 1592, and he died in 1593 A. D.
i. c. one year after his father's death. Virabhänūdaya Kaoya
informs us that Virabhadra was born in the lifetime of Virabhānu

and that on the occasion of his birth Humayun sent suitable presents
and congratulations to his grand-father Virabhānu, whom he regarded
as his brother. Virasimha, the father of Virabhānu was also regard-
ed as brother by Babur. Rāmachandra succeeded to the throne
when Virabhānu expired in 1540. The poem Virabhânūdaya Kaoya
was composed by one Madhava, son of Abhayachandra after the birth
of Virabhadra and in the lifetime of Virabhānu, his grand-father as
also of Humayun, the Mogul Emperor. As Virabhānu died in 1540,
this poem must have been written about that very year. The MS
of the poem was written 51 years after the date of composition of
the poem. The poem also contains the genealogy of the Vaghela
dyoasty as recorded above. King Virabhānu had a long reign and
Rāmachandra continued to rule as a Yuvarāja till the former retir-
ed to Prayaga after the death of his grand-son Virabhadra. Rāma.
chandra was very much enamoured of Tānsen, the renowned musi.
cal prodigy who attended Akbar's :court in 1562 and passed his
days with him in happiness.
The date of composition of Kandarpa-Cūdāmaņi of Virabhadra
viz. A. D. 1558 agrees with the date of Virabhadra's seal referred to
above viz. A. D. 1577 as also the date of his death viz. A. D. 1593.
It remains for us now to identify the reference to Virabhadra's
exploits at a place called Larkā described in the following verse
appearing in the Rasikajīvana of Gadādharabhatta' :-
" लङ्काधामनि वीरभानुनृपतेः प्रेक्ष्य प्रतापोदयं
प्रत्यागारमधीरनीरजहशो भूयो हुताशभ्रमात् ।
targifor forecare for fantes ( affatto --?) gas-
बापश्रेणि विलोलवेणि दयितं कण्ठस्थले विभ्रति ॥"
In the absence of the text of Virabhānūdayakãoya I am unable
to identify or verify the above reference to Lankā and Virabhānu's
exploits at this place, in case the verse has a definite reference to
a historical event in the career of King Virabhānu, the hero of the
Virabhänūdayakãoya. I, therefore, await with cagerness the publi-
cation of this historical Kavya, which as Dr. Hirananda Shastri
informs us, "possesses considerable literary merit cvincing high
descriptive power.''
1. IHQ, Vol. X, p. 483 - Dr. Sharma quotes two verses of the
poet Bhānukara in which King Virabhānu, his patron, is referred to.
The verse quoted above is one of these two verses.

6. Prof. P. P. S. Sastri, and the Date of
Vădirājatīrtha*
Prof P. P. S. Sastri, in his Introduction to Vol. III (Sabba-
parvan) of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārața, p. xi, makes
the following remarks about the date of Vâdirājatirtha and his
commentary on the Mahābhārata -
“Reference has already been made to the Lakşālamkāra of
Vädirāja, the contemporary of Vāgiſatirtha, one of the apostolic
successors of Anandatirtha the great dualistic philosopher.
Vădirāja died in '1261 Saka or 1339 A. D. (Vide R. G. Bhandarkar's
Collected Works, Vol. II, p. 7.) The Lakşalankára is very valuable
as it may possibly turn out to be the earliest dated commentary on the
Mahābhārata."
Being interested in the chronology of the commentaries on
the Mahābhārata I felt much interested in the above remarks of
Prof. Sastri about Vādirajatirtha's date and began to read some
of the works of this erudite philosopher with a view to gathering
chronological data. To begin with I perused his Tirthaprabandha-
kävya from a Ms in the Govt. M88 Library at the Bhandarkar
Institute (No. 622 of 1882-83). This poem contains description
of the places of pilgrimage and the deities presiding over them in
different parts of India. In particular I was much impressed by
Vădirāja's description of (1) the Vithobā of Pandharpur (Sholapur
* Annals ( B. O. R. Institute ), Vol. XVII, pp. 203-210.
1. I owe this information to my revered guru and colleague
Mahimahopādhyāya S. Kuppuswami Sastrigal.
2. In Duff's Chronology of India ( 1899 ) this date for Vādirāja
has been incorporated as under on page 210:
A. D. 1339 - $. 1261 – Death of Vădiråja, said to be same as
Kavindra, 8th successor of Anandatirtha in the Madhva Sect"
( Bhandarkar's Report 1882-83, pp. 8, 203 ).

District) and (2) Mahālakṣmi of Kolhapur.' Further while describ-
ing the Tata on the banks of the Tungabhadrā river Vadirāja was
found to refer to god fage. This reference roused my curiosity
still further as the verse containing this reference contains
the tradition current in the Maratha country about the transfer
of the image of Vithobā from Pandharpur to Vijayanagar on the
bank of the Tungabhadrā. I found this tradition referred to in
one of the Maratha Chronicles.

DATB OP VADIRAJATIRTHA
Malhar Ramrao Chitnis in his Life of Shivaji' composed in
A. D. 1811 states that the image of Vithobā was transferred from
Pandharpur to Vidyānagar or Vijayanagar as the Vijayanagar kings
were great upholders of Hinduism and full of devotion to Gods
and Brahmans. Later in the same context he mentions the names
Jnāneśvara and Bhānudāsa without mentioning the retransfer of
the image back to Pandharpur.
Mr. K. N. Sane, the editor of the above Bakhar of Chitnis in his
notes on the above mentioned passage of the Bakhar in question
makes the following remarks .-
“Rāmrājā of Vidyānag ar transferred the Vithobā of Pandhari to
Vijayanagar from whence he was brought back by sage Bhānudāsa of
Paithaņa (see Mahipati's Bhaktivijaya chapter 43 ) ....... It was
possible in the reign of Krsnadevarāya ( 1509-1530 ) that Vithobā
was taken from Pandhari to Vidyanagar. It is likely that the

* In a Sanskrit inscription dated Śaka 1159 ( = A. D. 1237 ) in
Vithoba's temple at Pandharpur the story of the boon to Pundalika is
referred to with the only difference that gossip is there called a Sage
or YTA (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. XX, p. 420 ). Vādirāja also refers to
पुण्डरीक as मुनि.
Coinpare also the following remarks of John Wilson in his article
“Ancient Remains of Western India ( J. B. B. R. A. S., Vol. III,
Jan. 1850) p. 87*-- " The celebrated temple of Vithobā near Pan-
dharpur is supposed to be a Buddhist structural temple now appro-
priated by the Brahmans. It certainly has the appearance of great
antiquity. The oversight of the distinction of caste among the
natives who frequent this shrine, when in the presence of the idol,
would seem to indicate some compromise with the Buddhists. In
villages near Pandharpur we have noted other ancient temples pro-
bably Buddhist which are entirely forsaken and which bear the marks
of violence probably Brahmanical or Musalman.”

temple of Vitthalasvāmi at Vijayanagar may have been com-
menced during his reign. The construction of this temple was
completed about A. D. 1542 during the reign of Acyutarāya, the
brother of Krşņadevarāya (vide Sardesai's Musalmani Riyasat, page
200, section 51). At that time Rāmarāya, the son-in-law of Krşņa-
devaraya, was the Prime Minister of the state and he continued in
that capacity from 1542 to 1565 A. D. As he was practically in
power he is called “ Kirīți Rāmarājā” in the Chitnis Bakhar.” 1
According to the tradition referred to in Mr. Sane's foregoing

1. Vijayanagar Third Dynasty by Prof. N. V. Ramanayya,
Madras, 1935 - Tri the greatest exponent of Madhvaism had
much influence with Krşñadevarāya (p. 322 ). He set up the image
of FTTHEFTTH in the courtyard of Vitthala temple at Hampi (p. 323 )
and died a little later in a. D. 1532.
On p. 439 Prof. Ramanayya observes :-"He (i. e. Kșsñarāya )
must have undertaken to reconstruct the Vitthalsvāmi' temple during
the last years of his reign which he was obliged to leave unfinished at
the time of his death ” ...... “ The construction of the Vitthal.
svāmi's Temple is usually attributed to Kșspadevarāya but he could
not have built that temple as it existed even in the time of Devarāya
II. We learn from Haribhațța, who lived in the first quarter of the
16th century that Proluganți Tippaņa, one of Devarāya's officers built
a bhogamangapa for Vitthala at Hampi.”
Dr. B. A. Saletore in his Social and Political Life in the Vijaya-
nagar Empire, Vol. II ; 1934 ), p. 163 observes :-" Acyutarāya's
gift of Suvarnameru was commemorated in a Sanskrit verse com-
posed by Võduva Tirumalamma (A. D. 1533) and inscribed in the
Vitthal Temple at Hampi.”
Mr. A. H. Longhurst in his Hampi Ruins ( 1917), p. 124
remarks :-" The temple was never finished nor consecrated. In
all probability the work was stopped by the destruction of the city
in 1565, but tradition gives another reason and says that it was built
specially for the famous image of Vithoba at Pandharpur in Sholapur
district of Bombay but that the god having come to look at it, refused
to move, saying that it was too grand for him and that he preferred
his own humbler home.” ( A fine photograph of Vitthala Temple at
Hampi appears on p. 126 of Mr. Longhurst's book showing its archi.
tectural grandeur ).

this he date of Vadisi R. G. Bhandatore than 200 Licāja as
remarks the transfer of Vithobā to Vijayanagar took place in the
middle of the 16th century, while if the date of Vădirājatirtha was
correct, this transfer would appear to have taken place before
A. D. 1339, the date of Vâdirāja's death, as given by Prof. P. P. S.
Sastri on the authority of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar. The difference
between the dates for this tradition being more than 200 years it
could not but raise doubts in my mind about the date of Vädirāja as
recorded in the Succession Lists of the High Priests of the Madhva
Sect,' as recorded by Sir R.G. Bhandarkar in his Report for 1882-83
(p. 203 onwards ). I also reported this contradiction between the
two dates to my friends Prof. S. V. Dandekar, M. A. of the S. P.
College, Poona, who has made a special study of the literature
about the Vithobã of Pandharpur as also Dr. B. A. Saletoje,
M. A., Ph. D. of the same College. The former told me that
the tradition known to him pertained to the 16th century,
while the latter informed me that the date for Vādirāja in the list
published by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar was definitely wrong. I
thereupon asked Dr. Saletore to state his evidence on the strength
of which he considered Bhandarkar's date A. D. 1339 for Vädirāja's
death as definitely wrong. He was kind enough to send me a
note recording epigraphic evidence in support of the date A. D.
1571 for Vadirājatirtha and I have great pleasure in reproducing it
here in extenso:

(E. C. VIII. Sb. 55, p. 10, p. 23 text. )
The date works out to A. D. 1571, November the 1st Thursday
when the nakṣatra was Bharani and not Krttikā. This was a Pau.
rnima ( Swamikannu, Indian Eph. V, p. 345.)
From other sources we know that Vādirāja's favourite disci-
ple was the well-known Kanaka Dāsa, the Non-Brahman ( Bedar)
devotee of Krsna. Kanaka Dăsa's dates are circa 1550-1570."
In addition to the above direct inscriptional evidence for
Vâdirāja we find two more inscriptions' one of A. D. 1614 and the
other A. D. 1613, in which Vadirāja and his pupil are mentioned.
There are in all 40 inscriptions at Udipi, the seat of Madhva
Matha. Two of these refer to Vādirāja and his pupil :-
“No. 231–110 of 1901—( Kanarese ). On another slab built
into the same wall (i. e. North wall of the Krşņa Matha). A record

DATE OF VIDIRAJATIRTHA
In view of the foregoing epigraphic evidence it is difficult to
believe in the accuracy of the Madhva Matha lists published by
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar so far as exact chronology is concerned. If
Vādirāja was living in A. D. 1571 as proved by the Soraba Hobli
inscription mentioned above it is perfectly natural for him to
refer to the transfer of the image of Vithobā to Vijayanagar in the
line "तुंगातीरगतोऽसि विठ्ठल" in the verse 13 of his तीर्थप्रबन्धकाव्य
quoted above and hence there is no sort of contradiction or
anachronism involved in the reference.
A question may be raised whether there was another arferis.
afei in the Madhva line of succession distinct and separate from
the alferrata referred to in the inscriptions mentioned above.
The Madhva lists published by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar already
alluded to by me show only one वादिराजतीर्थ and it was this वादिराज-
are that composed a commentary on the Mahābhārata. There is
a Ms' of Hitaarguizideroit ( Hrastarf TAT ) in which arigirst gives
the derivation of his own name in the following verses :-
"प्रणम्य नृहरि मध्वगुरुंश्वान्यान्यथामति ।
महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णयार्थः प्रकाश्यते ॥
वादी मध्वो यस्य राजा सोऽहं तस्य कृपावलात्।
वादिराजेन स्वशक्त्या वीणे वरणयामि तत्"
We may, therefore safely conclude that there was only one
Madhva philosopher of the name ang hate and that he flourished
about the 2nd half of the 16th century and that the date A. D. 1339
of his death recorded in the Madhva succession lists is definitely
wrong.
Prof. P. P. S. Sastri on pp. XIV-XV of his Introduction to the
Sabhāparvan ( Vol. III) of the Southern Recension of the Mabā.
bhārata states that the Ms' of Vădirāja's commentary used by him
records the following date when the copy was made by the scribe
Narasimha :-
" तारणे वत्सरे चैव माघे शुक्ले च पञ्चमी।
बुधवारे नारसिंह इदं लिखित पुस्तकम् ॥"
Prof. Sastri observes that“ The earliest date for the above is
30.1.1465 A. D. and the latest date satisfying the other particulars is
25-1-1645 A. D."

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
As the date 30-1-1465 A. D. cannot satisfy all particulars men.
tioned by the scribe, we have to reject it and adopt the date
25-1-1645 A. D. which as Prof. Sastri states satisfies all particulars.
This later date is perfectly in harmony with our date for Vadiraja
viz. 1571 A. D. If Vadiraja wrote about 1571 it is natural to have
a copy of his work in A. D. 1645.
In view of the facts recorded in this note it is difficult to
accept an early date for Vadirajatirtha as Prof. P. P. S. Sastri has
done in the extract from his Introduction to one of the Mahā-
bharata volumes quoted by us already. In case Prof. Sastri suc-
ceeds in establishing on incontrovertible grounds an earlier date
for Vādirājatirtha I shall be very glad to know the independent
evidence, if any, on the strength of which his conclusion may be
based. For the present at least the inscriptional evidence record-
ed by me in this note compels me to reject all conjectural and
other data gathered on the question 80 far.

proper inquiries.
In the absence of this only MS of the Adhikaranacandrikå it
is difficult to say anything authoritatively about the author of this
work or the work itself. Let me, however, record in this paper
some evidence which goes to disprove that Apadeva the author
of the Adhikaranacandrıkā is identical with Āpadeva, the author of
the very popular Mimāmsā work called the Mimämsänyāyaprakāśa
otherwise called Apadevi.' The genealogy of Apadeva, the
author of the Mimämsänyāyaprakāśa as recorded by his son Anan-
tadeva in his work Smặtikaustubha is as follows:-
Ekanātha'
son
Apadeva (I)

in the Govt. Ori. Series (Bhandarkar O. R. Institute, Poona, 1937)

The work has been edited by Dr. Ganganath Jha in the Pandit, 26

the English translation of the work by Prof. Franklin Edgerton of the
Yale University would be found very useful as it contains the trans-
literated Sanskrit text, a glossarial index together with a critical
Introduction and Bibliography (Pub. by the Yale University
Press, 1929).

APADBVA AND HIS NAMBSAKE
Aufrecht' makes the following entry in his Catalogus Catalo.
gorum regarding the works of Apadeva, the author of the Mimāmsă-
nyāyaprakāśa :-
"sztrgan, son of Anantadeva, grandson of Āpadeva father of
Anantadeva, pupil of Govinda.

“ This can hardly be the same as the well-known Maratha poet -
Saint Eknāth, although he lived at Pratişthāna ( Paithan) also 'on the
banks of the Godāvari'." This Eknātha died in 1609 and apparently
had only one son, named Hari.*
[ * See Justin E. Abbott, Ekanäth, Poona, 1927. For Ekanāth's
only son, Hari see pp. 211 ff.; for the date of Ekanāth's death, p. 263. ---
It is, however, extremely likely that the coincidences of name and
location are not entirely meaningless; that is the poet-Saint Eknath
belonged to the same distinguished family as his (younger?) con-
temporary, our Apadeva.”]
As Prof. Edgerton has raised his doubts about the identity of the
two Ekanāths it may be worthwhile examining this question in detail
on the basis of available evidence.

I am concerned in this paper with the work called the Adhi.
karanacandrikā represented by only one MS as stated above. Let
us now see if this work on Mimāṁsā is the work of the author of
the Mimańsányāyaprakāśa.
Both the works viz., the Adhikaranacandrika and the Mimāṁsā-
nyayaprakasa deal with Mimāṁsā. This is the only common
point on the basis of which Aufrecht has ascribed both the
works to the author of the Mimamsänyāyaprakāśa as can be seen
from his catalogue entry quoted above. Besides this identity of
subject the same name A padeva must have also led him to identify
one Apadeva with the other. I am inclined to doubt this identity
on the basis of the following particulars which show both the points
of identity and difference revealed from the evidence available
to us :-
Author of Mimāṁsānyāyaprakāśa
Author of Adhikaraşacandrikā
(1) Identity of the name
Āpadeva (the colophons
of MSS of Mim. Ny.
Prakāśa mention the name
Apadeva as the author of
the work).
(1) The colophon of the only
MS of the Adhikarana-
candrikâ mentions Apa-
deva as the author of the
work.
(2) This Apadeva is called the
son of Anantadeva in the
colophons
( gfa sthaaraa gaT 8779-
faa ni tataraT494797-
संज्ञकं प्रकरणं etc.)
This Apadeva is called
Mahamahopadhyāya but
his father's name is not
recorded (the colophon
reads :--
इति महामहोपाध्यायमीमांसकश्री.
आपदेवकृताधिकरणचन्द्रिका सं.

(3) This Āpadeva was a wor.
shipper of Krşņa. In
verse 1 of Mimāṁsānyāya.
prakāśa he bows
Govinda or Krşņa.

worshipper of Krşņa. In

This Apadeva is called

" Mahāmahopadhyāya" in
the only MS of the Adhi-
karanacandrikā described
by R. Mitra.
I am inclined to believe that the author of the Mimāṁsā work

the entire work where the author expressly claims originality for the

conclude that Kțşpa was a family deity from Apadeva I to Apadeva
II, and that the study of Mimāṁsā also continued without a break
for at least three generations.
It appears that the Mimāṁsaka Mahamahopadhyâya Apadeva
composed another work called the Smſticandrikā. This work also
is represented by a single MS described by Rajendralal Mitra.'

believe, sufficiently convincing to warrant an inference that these

Smyticandrika. Though we have no evidence to estimate the
dates of both these works for want of evidence we have more stable
chronology for the author of the Apadevi, viz.. Apadeva II.
Prof. Edgerton'secords the following evidence regarding the
date of Apadeva II :
(1) Anantadeva, the son of Apadeva II wrote a commen-
tary on his father's Mimārsa-Nyaya-Prakāśa. This
commentary is called Bhäſtālamkāra.
(2) Khandadeva in his Bhäffadipikā criticized both the
Mimämsä-Nyaya-Prakāśa as also its commentary Bhatja.
lamkâra as specifically stated in the Prabhävali, a com-
mentary on the Bhattadipikå ( composed in 1708 A. D.)?
by Sambhubhatta, pupil of Khandadeva.
(3) Khandadeva died at Benares in A. D. 1665.
(4) We are, therefore, justified in assuming the early part of
the 17th century as the approximate date of Āpadeva.
" Mr. Kane assigns Apadeva to the period 1600 to 1650 A. D.
because he was father of Anantadeva, who flourished in the
"third quarter of the 17th century."
The conclusion arrived at by Profs. Edgerton and Kane
regarding Apadeva's date on independent grounds finds further
corroboration from MSS as follows :-
(1) The Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona,
has a MS of the Mimāmsa-Nyaya-Prakašikå, viz., No. 576
of 1884-87. This MS was copied in Samvat 1716 ( Aśvina
Sukla Pratipadi ) i.e., on 7th September, 1659. As this

APADEVA AND HIS NAMBSAKE
is almost a contemporary copy of the work, scholars in-
terested in textual criticism' may find it useful.
(2) A work called the Rudrapaddhatta is ascribed to Apadeva
II. In 1871 one Mr. Bālambhatta of Surat had a copy
of Rudrapaddhati of Apadeva containing 55 leaves ( 12
lines on a page ). The age of the MS is 1662 which
appears to be a Samoat year because Bühler who noticed
this MS gives us to understand that " If no remark is
added the era in which the MSS are dated, is Samvat.”
The age 16624 recorded in Bühler's list must, therefore,
be Samvat 1602 ( = A. D. 1606 ). Presuming the correct-
ness of Bühler's entries we must look upon this copy of
Rudrapaddhati as the oldest dated MS of a work
asrcibed to an author of the name Apadeva, even if we
doubt the identity of this Apadeva with the author of
the Mimāṁsänyāyaprakāśa. In case we succeed in getting
incontrovertible evidence to prove the identity of the
author of the Rudrapaddhati with the author of the Mim.
Nyā. Prakāśa we shall be in a position to take the date of
Apadeva II to the last quarter of the 16th century. At
present, however, the B. O. R. Institute MS of the
Mimāṁsānyāyaprakāśa copied on 7th September, 1659
provides the best MS evidence for the date of Apa-
desa II.
On the basis of evidence recorded above the following con-
clusions may be arrived at :-
(1) The works Adhikaranacandrikā and the Smsticandrika
are composed by the same author, 013., Mimārsaka
Mahāmahopadhyāya Apadeva.
1. As Prof. Edgerton has constituted his text on the basis of
three printed editions (Vide Intro. to Apadevi, p. 1) I recommend
this MS to him for a critical edition of this useful text which appears
to me a desideratum in spite of the numerous editions now available.

(2) The author of the Mimämsänyāyaprakāśikā (also called
Apadevi ) appears to be different from the author of the
Adhikaranacandrika and the Smſticandrika.
(3) It may be tentatively suggested that there is a possi-
bility of the author of the Adhikaranacandrikå being
identical with Apadeva I, the grandfather of Apadeva II
(author of the Apadevi ) but this suggestion needs more
evidence than what has been incidentally recorded in
this paper.

According to Dr. De the extreme limits of Appaya's literary activity
are 1549 and 1613 A. D. “Verkața, author of the Visvaguņådarsa
and a grandson of Appaya tells us that he hailed from Kāñci (or
Conjeveram)." Compare the following reference to Kāñci in the
Vedantakalpataruparimala :- "काच्या को मार्ग इति प्रश्न मार्गग्रहणोपायतया

Appaya wrote this commentary on the Vedāntakalpataru of Amalā-
nanda who flourished c. A. D. 1250 ( Vide J. N. Farquhar : Outlines of
Religious Literature of India, Oxford: 1920, pp. 368, 222). Amala-
nanda resided at Nasik-Tryambak as will be seen from the descrip-

kalpataru :-

Evidently Appayadikşita was a firm believer in the stability ( prati-
şthā ) of the earth and rejects categorically the theory of the only
Indian astronomer who believed in the diurnal motion of the
carth,' which is mentioned in the following verse quoted by
Mr. S. B. Dikshit :-
" अनुलोमगतिनीस्थः पश्यत्यचलं विलोमगं यत् ।
अचलानि भानि तद्वत् समपश्चिमगानि लंकायाम् ॥" (गोलपाद)
Mr. Dikshit further states that this verse regarding the theory
of Aryabhata pertaining to the diurnal motion of the earth has been
wrongly interpreted by his commentator in his work called Bhat-
taprakāśikä as follows:-
“भानि कर्तृभूतानि अचलानि भूमिगतानि वस्तूनि कर्मभूतानि विलोमगानीव
प्राची दिशं गच्छतीव पश्यति"
Mr. Dikshit records that the date of Sūryadevayajvan, the
author of the commentary Bhattaprakāśikā is not known but he is
likely to be later than Bhattotpala? ( A. D. 966 ).' Brahmagupta, how-
ever. in his Brahmasiddhanta or Brahmasphutasiddhanta (com-
posed in Saka 550 = A.D. 628 ) has found fault with Aryabhata's
theory about the diurnal motion of the earth in the following
verse :
"प्राणेनैति 'कलां भूयदि तर्हि कुतो व्रजेत् कमध्वानं ।

was born in Sake 398 ( = A. D. 476 ) and it is creditable that he
anticipated the theory of the diurnal motion of the earth about 1500
years ago in spite of a carping critic like Brahmagupta,' who was
then ignorant of the law of gravity, later discovered by Sir Isaac
Newton in A. D. 1665, and hence tried to ridicule Aryabhata in the
line “nadagogista a taifa 87: (AIC.” Appayadikşita's
grounds for rejecting the war of Aryabhata have no astronomi-
cal tinge whatsoever. A staunch believer as he was in the gra.
grarw he rejects the At because it is opposed to tra. Coper-
nicus ( 1473-15+3 A. D. ) apparently preceded Appayadikşita ( 1550
to 16:00 A. D. ) while Sir Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 A.D.) followed
him. The great Vedāntin, however was compelled to dismiss
the T arg of Aryabhata and others in a summary manner because
it was opposed to the statement of the श्रुति viz., 'पृथिवी प्रतिष्ठा.'
Sripati, the author of the Siddhāntasekhara, wrote his work
Dhruvamānasam in Saka 9789 = A.D. 1054. Makkibhațţa wrote a
commentary on the Siddlăutaśckliara in Saka 1299' = A.D. 1377.
Makkib hattı follows Aryabhata in his theory about the diurnal
motion of the earth in commenting on verse 39 of Sadhanadhyaya
of the Siddhantaſekhara. We are informed by the learned editor
of the Siddhantasekhara that Varāhamihira, Brahmagupta, Lalla as
also Sripati had no respect for the theory of Aryabhata about IHAUT
or the diurnal motion of the earth. It seems, therefore, that

Ben 8, NW. 18, Säcipatra 36 - "Stein 21.",
As the Jammu MS of the Prayascitta-Candrikā is dated Samvat
1556 or A. D. 1600, the date of composition of the work is evi-
dently much earlier than A. D. 1600 but we have no means of
determining the earlier limit exactly.
In the Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts of the Punjab Uni.
versity, however, there is a dated MS of the Prayaścitta-Can.
drikå which appears to me to be the oldest dated MS of this work.
It is dated Samvat 1599 = A. D. 1543s as will be seen from the
following colophonº appearing on its last folio :-
"इति श्रीनृसिंहदीक्षितसूनु विश्वनाथविरचिता श्रौतप्रायश्चित्तचन्द्रिका
समाता ॥ संवत् १५९९ समऐ पौषवदि १३ चन्द्रकह पुस्तक लिषा ॥ श्रीविश्वनाथाय
FA: 11 SHAET 11"
If the above date is correct, we are in a position to push back
the date of the Prayascitta-Candrikā before A. D. 1540, if not
carlier.
The chronological data recorded above may now be tabulated
as follows:---
1. Vide p. 91 of Part I of 1.0, Sanskrit MSS Cata. ( 1887-
MS No. 15726 -- " written in Devanagari in the latter part of the
17th Century."
2. Vide p. 108 of Bühler's Fascicle. III of Cata. of MSS in
Private Libraries ( 1872). The MS No. 239 of graftarlar of fa47779-

10. Date of Subhāșitamuktāvalik
Prof G. V. Devasthali in his Catalogue of Sanskrit and Prākta
Manuscripts' in the Library of the University of Bombay, describes
a MS of Thailami.of it (No. 2266 ) as follows :-
"The Subhasitahärávali or simply Härávali) is an anthology con-
taining about 200 verses divided according to the compiler's own
account, int) 32 chapters ( Manis ). In our MS, however, only 13
are clearly marked. The colophon at the end reads Subhäşita-
muktāmani as the title of the work, which is obvivusly incorrect.
This work is noticed at Peters. Report II. No. 189, where it
is ascribed to Hari Kavi, brother of Cakrapāņi. Hari Kavi was a
poet of the Deccan and acquainted with the literature of the whole
of India. He quotes from Akabariya Kālidāsa ( a poet petronised
by Akbar) and from Jagannātha Pandita's Bhāminiviläsa. He can-
not, therefore, have flourished before the latter half of the 17th
century A. D. See Krishn. p. 387 f." The foregoing remarks
roused my curiosity because I had read in 1935 the only MS of
ghragttract of greater ( No. 92 of A 1883-84 ) available in the
Govt. Mss Library at the B.O. R. Institute. Through the favour
of Dr. P. M. Joshi, Librarian, University Library, Bombay, I
got on loan the MS of " gheatrit of fir" described by Prof.
Duvasthali. On examinii.glois Mot found that it wis entirely a
a different text from that available in the B. O. R. I. MS No. 92 of
A 1883-84 and consequently its chronology, as suggested by Prof.
* Indian Historical Quarterly, 1946p pp. 55–59.
1. Vol. II. 1944. p. 772.
2. The Subhāṣitahärávali of Hari Kavi, brother of Cakrafăpi is
represented by the only MS in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R.
Institute viz No. 92 of A 1883-84. This GHTGETTTTO has nothing
to do with the “ GUTTGAETTTT of " described by Prof. Devasthali.
Evidently Prof. Devasthali has not read my paper on “Hari Kadi,
alias Bhanubhaſta, a court.poet of king Sambhāji and His works (IY-
राजचरित composed in A. D. 1685, हैहयेन्द्रचरित and its Commentary, and
gHTETTT ). See Annals ( B. O. R. I.), Vol. XXVI (1935), pp.
262-291.
The MS mentioned by Peterson in his Report, II, p. 189 18
identical with No. 92 of A 1883-84 (GHTETTant of art #fa). It
consists of more than 150 folios.

Devasthali's remarks perhaps on the presumption that the Bom-
bay university MS No 2266 and the B. O. R. I. MS No. 92 of A
1883-84 are identical, is also wrong.
The Bombay University MS No. 2266 is dated Śaka 1707
( = A. D. 1785 ) and though this date harmonises with the chrono-
logy suggested by Prof. Devasthali there is another evidence
which contradicts it. In fact there is a M$.of an anthology called
Hoa rast in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute
viz. No. 819 of 1886-92. It is identical with the Bombay Univer-
sity MS No. 2266. The text of this MS is identical with that of
the Bombay University MS. It begins with “ XTTO127177 TA: 11
F ATEHET41T etc.” The colophons of the different chapters
or Manis in this Ms begin with "fa fundaymizent” in the
following manner -
Folio 3"fa gurfsagarachi' storgra acat ar gal ger-
Afor: »
Folio 44"gfagorgaqi Fatiga qa fatet frafa: "
It would appear from these colophons thst the title of this
anthology is guilgað fract, though in the first three versesa at the
beginning the author tells us that he has strung together this
हारावली of different मुक्कामणिs. Whatever be the exact title of the
work, whether, सुभाषित मुक्तावली or सुभाषितहारावली, one thing is clear
that this anthology is in no way connected with the qurtaITTTST
of ETT la alias HITHE, the court-poet of the Maratha king Sam-
bhaji, the son of Shivaji the Great.
The following table shows the topics of the 32 chapters of this
anthology:
1. The colophons of the Bombay University MS No. 2265 also
mention the title of the anthology as "YHTgagna61" (see folios 2
and 3 of this MS ).
In the Catalogue of Indic MSS in U.S. A. by H. I. Poleman,
1938, p. 106, he mentions a fragment ( No. 2229 ) of a work called
GHINA Tract ( folios 3-1). I cannot say if this work is identical with
the anthology before me.
2. I quote below the first 3 verses of the anthology :-
"11 **TITŪTTAA: 11

DATE OF SUBAŞIT AMUKTÄVALI

I interpret the chronogram griglia as equal to Samrat
1680 = A. D. 1623 and this date harmonises with the present con.
dition of the MS and its calligraphy.
The authorship of the anthology is ascribed tot by Prof.
Devasthali. I have failed to find any mention of this author in
the B. O. R. Institute MS No. 819 of 1886-92 or the Bombay Uni-
versity MS No. 2266, which is incomplete. If the date A. D.
1624 of the B. O. R. Institute MS of the work is correct we may
reasonably infer that this anthology was composed prior to A. D.
1600 and consequently it would be an anachronism to connect it
with Hari Kavi who composed his Sambhurājacarita in a. D. 1685.
The earlier limit to the date of this anthology can be fixed if
we can find in it some datable verses. Unfortunately this antho-
logy does not record the names of the authors or works, to whom
it is heavily indebted for its 560 verses. Incidentally one taata.
fa is referred to on folio 3 in the following verse at the end of
chapter 2 ( : opinquä):-
"नाभितस्तव सरोजभूरभूत् तत्सुतेयमबला सरस्वती।।
तत्प्रसादलवलेशगर्विता: श्रीनिवासकवयोऽपि किं विदुः ॥१५॥"
Scholars who have closely studied the history of our Sub-
hasitas may be able to identify this verse and and its author
waaraa. Without a comprehensive Pratika index to all Sans-
krit Subhäşitas, their chronology must remain vague and undeter-
mined. It is hoped that some of our research institutes would
devote their attention to the compilation of such a Pratika index,
which would provide a compass to those who navigate in this ocean
of Subhāșita literature. Many problems of literary chronology
will be solved automatically by such a Pratika index and strenthen
the work done in this field by individual workers like myself.

This MS is identical with MS No. 362 of 1895-98 in the Govt.
MSS Library at the BO. R. Institute, Poona. It consists of 11
folios ( 10 lines to a page, 36 letters to a line ). The MS is
written in Devanagari characters on country paper, which is old in
appearance but well preserved. It begins':-
"ॐ॥ श्रीगणाधिपतये नमः ॥

1. In the top-margin before the beginning of the text we find
the following verse recorded in a slightly different hand-writing

"अधरे नववीटिकानुरागो नयने कज्जलमुज्वलं दुकूलं ।
इदमाभरणं नितंबिनीनामितरं मूषणमगदूषणानि ॥१॥"
This verse is identical with verse 29 on p. 263 of सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागार,
N. S. Press, Bombay, 1911. Evidently it has nothing to do with the
text of the भंगारकल्लोल.

of the SK of Rāyabhatta enables us to conclude that Rāyabhatta
flourished definitely before A. D. 1602 or even before A. D. 1550.
I have not come across any quotations from the SK except the
two verses mentioned as Rayabhatta's (रायभहस्य ) in the antho-
logy Padyaveni of Venidatta, who composed his Pañcatattua-
prakāśikā in A. D. 1644.' These two verses are Nos. 311 and 351 in
the critical edition of the Padyaveri by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri. They
read as follows:--

the SK of Rāyabhatta, a MS of which has been noticed by Peterson
in his Sixth Report. This MS is identical with MS No. 362 of 1895-
98 described by me in this paper. I have verified Dr. Chaudhuri's
surmise and found it correct. The text of the two verses reads as
follows in the MS of the SK dated A. D. 1602 before me. :-
folio 3—verse 15
" Garför fararuto stazu wungant që
लीकोदंचितमध्यमाकरयुगेनावय॑ तस्कंधरी ।
वक्षस्तस्य धनोलतस्तनभरेणापीड्य गाढं रसा.

folio 4 - verse 27
" प्रस्थाने शकुनानि संतु सततं भद्रं तवोऽज्जुंभता-

पाचेऽहं विधिमत्र हंत अविनामप्रेसराणां मम
tropiat feu #t #pafe wafgang EITTA: 11 PO II"
The identity of the two verses quoted as FTTHEFT by Venidatta with
those numbered 15 and 27 in the SK of Rāyahhatta' has now been
clearly established. As Rāyabhatta flourished long before A. D.
1602, the date of the MS of his SK, it is natural that he should be
quoted by a subsequent anthologist who flourished about A. D.
1644. In the colophon of the MS of the SK before us Rāvabhațța
is called “ Tare" and his present poem is called " TETORIT”
in the last verse 104. We must, therefore, search for any other
works of this poet, if they can be traced in any libraries, private
or public. For the present the B. O. 'R. Institute MS of the
Srngära-Kallola remains as a unique MS of Rāyabhatta's only
available work. As this poem is written in a delightful style with
elegant diction it deserves to be published early, I have, therefore,
persuaded Prof. N. A. Gore of the S. P. College to edit it and I
hope he will publish it in some journal at an early date.
1. Råyambhatta, author of fair got mentioned by Aufrecht
(CC. I, 526 ) is evidently a different person (from Rāyabhatta the
author of the SK).

12. A New Approach to the Date of
Bhattoji Dikșita*
According to Dr. Saletore' Bhattoji Dikşita is to be assigned to
" the last quarter of the Sixteenth and the first quarter of the Seven.
teenth Century "i. e. between A. D. 1575 and 1625. According to
Rao Bahadur Bambardekara Bhattoji Dikşita was born about A. D.
1570 and died about A. D. 1635.

pp. 117–127.

1. Vide Karnatak Historical Review ( January-July 1937):-"No
evidence is forth-coming to suggest that Bhațgoji Dikşita was a
Senvi Brahmin. As regards the age in which he lived we learn from
the opening verses of Tattva - Kaustubha that he wrote it at the
order of Kela di Venkațendra (Keladi Verkatendrasya nirdesät
Vidusām mude ). ( Read Hultzsch, Report on Sanskrit Mss of South
India, II, Intro. Pp. xii, 122, Madras, 1895-1896). The ruler
Verkațendra mentioned here is to be identified with king Venkatapa
Nāyak I, who ruled from A. D. 1582 till A. D. 1629 ( Rice : Mysore
and Coorg from the Inscriptions, p. 157 ). King Veņkațapa Nayak
was noted for the patronage he gave to learned men ( Read Keladi
Basavarāja, Sivatattvaratnākara, Kallola VI, Taranga XIII. Ed. by
B. Ramarao and Sundara Sastri, Mangalore, 1927 ; cf. S. K. Aiyangar,
Sources of Vijayanagar History, p. 345 ). He himself seems to
have composed a commentary in Sanskrit on the Siva Gitā of Padma-
purāna (Trien. Cata, of Mss in the Govt. Ori. Mss Library, Madras,
p. 2623 ). We have, therefore, to assign Bhațgoji Dikşita, who calls
himself the son of Srimad-vidvan-mukuța-māņikya Lakşmidhara
Bhatta in the Tattva-Kaustubha to the last quarter of the Sixteenth
and the first quarter of the Seventeenth Century A. D.”

the author makes the following remarks about the chronology of
Seşakşşņa, Appaya Dikşita, Bhattoji and Jagannātha Paņạitarāya :-

I propose now to point out some facts regarding Bhattoji's
date, which have not been recorded either by Dr. Saletore or Rao
Bahadur Bambardekar but which go to support the probable chrono.
logy for Bhattoji given by them.
It appears that an author of some some Vedānta works called
Nrsimhāśrama' was the guru of Bhattoji Dilkşita and that one of
this guru's works was commented upon by Bhattoji. According to
-- --

-----
(Continued from the previous page)
descendants of Appaya state that he lived from A. D. 1554 to 1626
( 72 years ) while other writers state that he flourished between
A. D. 1520 and 1593. Seşakşsņa lived before A. D. 1600 while
Jagan nātha is supposed to have lived before A. D. 1660. The period
of Jagannātha's literary activity is given as A. D. 1630 – 1660.
There is a Ms of Jagannatha's Citramimāṁsākhandana dated A. D.
1652 1653, from which it appears that the present belief of Jagan.
nätha's direct opposition to Appaya is baseless. Bhațgoji is said to
have lived from A. D. 1576 to A. D. 1634 or 1640 or 1650. If we base
our arguments regarding the rivalry between Bhattoji and Appaya on
the several dates given above we are inclined to think that some of
the present beliefs regarding the relations of these two writers are
positively baseless as they give rise to anachronisms. Hence we must
rely on documentary evidence only in our investigation of this
problem."
1. Vide p. 353 of Bambardekar's Bhattoji Diksita. On p. 305
some information about Nșsiṁhāśrama is recorded :- TRIETH was
the guru of Bhattāji. Bhațgoji composed a commentary called
विवरण on the work तत्त्वविवेक of नृसिंहाश्रम. This very नृसिंहाश्रम was the
guru of Rangoji bhațța, the younger brother of Bhaſtoji. Rangoji in
his work, अद्वैतचिंतामणि refers to नृसिंहाश्रम as guru (“तदुक्तं श्री नृसिंहाश्रम-

Rao Bahadur Bambardekar the name of this commentary' is a free
fator while according to Aufrecht its name is avatar ansett-turut

A. D. 1618 states that this work was composed by TTEETSTH (folio
147-MS No. 566 of 1886-92) while Hall states that guara nya? is
a commentary on the Harta of ZIRETTA by an unnamed disciple.
In the list of Bhattoji's works recorded by Bambardekar (p. 354)
we find the entry "artiai1925TTETI." If we are to believe in
the testimony of the colophon of A. D. 1618 which clearly states
that the work was composed by नृसिंहाश्रम, the work तत्वविवेकदोपन is
a work of TIRETTA himself and that Bhattoji wrote a commentary
on this work of his guru. It is, however, stated by Dr. Das

" There are tgp_cytuor which is a commentary on the commentary
तत्वविवेकदीपन of नारायणाश्रम (a pupil of नृसिंहाश्रम) on the latter's
work, वेदान्ततत्वविवेक." Whether the तत्वविवेकदीपन is the work of
TRACTWA or of his pupil PIT ROOTSTA, its MS of A. D. 1618 should
naturally have a special value for us in considering the chronology
of नृसिंहाश्रम and his pupils (1) नारायणाश्रम and (2) भहोजिदीक्षित, who
were evidently contertiporaries of each other and junior contem-
poraries of their common guru PT TETSTÆ, who composed his
nearea in A. D. 1547' as stated by Aufrecht. The chronological
relation of these two pupils with their guru may be represented as
follows:
THEISTA living in A. D. 1547
(MS of his garaa dated A. D. 1615)
pupil.....
... ... ... pupil
(1) Hatfet
12) 77712707TTA
[MS of his टीका
on his guru's तत्वविवेक
is dated A.D. 1618].?
If the ETSTA was living in a. D. 1547 as proved by the date of
composition of his aaraat we are unable to accept the date A. D.
1500 for TETETTH given by Dr. Das Gupta, and the period of N's
1. The B.O. R. Institute Ms of daaraan (No. 278 of 1895-98 )
contains the chronogram of the date of composition viz. Samvat
1604 :-
"अद्वे वेदवियद्रसेन्दुगणिते पोषासिते श्रीदिने।
रक्षो नामनि पुरुषोत्तमपुरे ग्रंथे मुदाचीकरत् ॥"
2. atgrTorna's commentary on TETA'S HERETETT is represented
by a dated Ms (No. 123 of A 1883-84 ) in the Govt. Mss Library). It
was copied in Samvat 1710 ( = A. .D. 1654 ) at Benares.
3. History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. II (1932), p. 216 ~ "N
simhaśrama Muni ( A. D. 1500 ) was a pupil of Girvāṇendra Sarasvati
and Jagannathāśrama and teacher of Nārāyaṇāśrama who wrote a com-
mentary on his Bhedadhikkära. He wrote many works etc.”
If a work like Tattvaviveka is composed by its author in A. D.
1547 we may at the best suppose that he was born about A. D. 1500
but his literary activity must be presumed to lie a few years either
way from A. D. 1547 i. e, say between A. D. 1530 and 1560 or 80.

literary activity must be assigned to the middle of the 16th century
say between A. D. 1530 and 1560 and consequently the literary
activity of his pupils Bhattāji (= B) and Nārāyaṇāśrama (=NA)
must lic in the last quarter of the 16th Century i. e. between A. D.
1575 and 1600. This inference harmonizes with the date A. D.
1618 in which year a MS of N's pupil's work came to be written as
we have seen above. It is also possible to suppose that this
pupil was living when the Ms was copied in A. D. 1618, though
his guru TIETOA may not have lived upto A. D. 1618.

Mss Libraries in India and outside. They are dated A. D.
1664, 1676, 1677, 1735, 1754 etc. These dates would enable us to
state that Bhattoji flourished before A. D. 1650. This limit does
not, however, help us very much in the matter of Bhattoji's
chronology. Hara Prasad Shastri, however, gives us a surer
criterion to fix the age of Bhattoji to whom and to whose son,
Vatsa-Rāja salutes in' his work called the Vārānasidarpanapra-
kāśikā' composed in Samvat 1698 (= A. D. 1642). A still better
criterion for fixing the limit for Bhattoji's date is furnished by
the date of composition of a work called शब्दशोभा by नीलकंठ शुक्ल,
apupil of भट्टोजि ("भहोजिदीक्षितछात्रः") This date is Samvat 1693 or
1. Vide, p. 175 of Descriptive Catalogue of Kavya Mss (Vol.
VII), Calcutta (A. S. B.), 1934.-वाराणसीदर्पणप्रकाशिका-The author and
the commentator of this work are one and the same person TATTS.
“The text is not yet found. It was composed in Samvat 1698
(संवत् षोडशाष्टनवतितमे वर्षे ) as appears from the commentary on the last
verse. Herein lies the importance of the Ms under notice as
affording a surer criterion to fix the age of Bhattoji Dikşita to whom
and to whose son the author salutes at the beginning as his gurus."
Dr. Belvalkar (Systems of Sanskrit Grammar, p. 48 ) states that
सत्वराज a disciple of वीरेश्वर (=भानुजी) son of भट्टोजी दीक्षित wrote in
1641 A. D. I believe that this सत्वराज is the same as वत्सराज the author
of the वाराणसीदर्पणप्रकाशिका.

DATB OF BHATTOJI DIKSITA
A. D. 1637 and hence 5 years earlier than Vatsarāja's work of
A. D. 1642.'
We are now in a position to fix two sure limits to Bhattāji's
date viz. A. D. 15472 when his guru TIETETA composed his Healaats
at gohANT and A. D. 1637, when his pupil ( 317 ) composed his
work toesitat. Bhattoji must stand chronologically midway
between his guru and his pupil as shown below:-
नृसिंहाश्रम -→ pupil भट्टोजि -→ pupil नीलकंठ शुक्ल (wrote
( wrote varaa in A. D. 1547—
Tagat in A. D. 1637
Ms dated 1615 - and another
-Ms dated A. D.
work in 1558 A. D.)
1680.)
Now the exact period of Bhattoji's life can be determined only if
we can determine the exact periods of the lives of ZTETSH and
tools. I shall now tabulate some of the present views regard-
ing Bhattoji's date :--
1. Dr. Saletore's | A. D. 1575-1625

1. Aufrecht (CCI, 395 ) states that Bhațšoji Dikşita " is
quoted by atostor in the 31ToTTLE." According to Prof. P. V. Kane
Tist's literary career falls between A. D. 1610 and 1645 ( Hist. of
Dharma. I, 440). If the exact date of 31797Taya is determined it will
give us a more exact limit to Bhattoji's date than what is furnished by
the period A. D. 1610-1645 to which the 17tha evidently belongs.
2. Prof. B. N. Krishnamurthi Sarma states that Nțsimhāśrama
" wrote one of his works in 1547 and another in 1558" (Vide p. 666
of NIA-Jan. 1940). This statement is against the date A. D. 1500
for NȚsimhāśrama given by Dr. Das Gupta and supports my view
about Bhattoji's date recorded in this paper.

The above table shows the unstable state of Bhattoji's chrono.
logy. We have, however, indicated in this paper two sure dates
on the strength of which the period of Bhattoji's life can be deter-
mined. As Bhattoji's pupil Nilakantha Sukla' wrote a work in
A. D. 1637 after having studied Grammar under Bhattoji (sp76-
yoqma: Elfs Irana: ) we may allow a period of about 20 years
between this pupil and Bhattoji. On the other hand if we allow a
period of 20 years between Bhattoji aod his guru Nșsiṁhāśrama
who wrote a work in A. D. 1547 the period of Bhattoji's life would
be " A. D. 1557 to A. D. 1627" i.e. a period of 70 years. This
period arrived at on the strength of the dates of Bhattoji's guru
and pupil gives independent corroboration to the following views
of scholars regarding Bhattoji's age :-
1. On p. 454 of P. V. Kane's History of Dharmasastra I, ( 1930)
we read “ Nīlakantha Sukla wrote a work in Saṁvat 1663. Here
"1663 " is a misprint for“ 1693”.

wrote his great 90TT at the request of this Räjā for the education of
his son $CTIOT ( Prakriyaprakasa, v. 35 ). Perhaps FactTUT and Telia read
together.

A. D. 1636 — Composition of TOFTTHT (Leipzig Cata. 760 ) by

the date " A. D. 1630” given by Dr. Belvalkar for Bhattoji is wrong.

DATE OF BHATTOJI DIKŞITA
(1) P. V. Kane—"A. D. 1560-1620”- 60 years.
(2) B. A. Saletore" A. D. 1575-1625”- 50 years.
(3) W. A. Bambardekar—"A. D. 1570-1635" 65 years.
I agree with Sir R. G. Bhandarkar's view regarding Bhattoji's
date' in so far as he states that “ Bhattoji lived after the third quar-
ter of the 16th Century” but it is difficult to agree with him when
he states that “Bhattoji's literary activity must have begun at the
earliest about the year 1631 A. D. i. e. he might safely be understood
to have flourished about the middle of the Seventeenth Century.” If
this conclusion is accepted it is difficult to reconcile it with the
facts recorded in this paper and in particular with the fact that
Bhattoji's guru Nysimhāśrama composed one of his works in A. D.
1547. To make Bhattoji of A. D. 1650 a contemporary of his
senior of A. D. 1547 would be allowing him a span of life exceed-
ing even the normal span of “ three score years and ten.”
We have taken A.D. 1637 (= Samvat 1693 ) as the later terminus
for Bhattoji's date but I think, we can push back this limit to A. D.
1633 ( = Samvat 1689 ) which is the date of a Msof Bhattoji's
TOCHTETH recorded by M.M. Haraprasad Sastri. If this date is
genuine we have before us the earliest dated Ms of Bhattoji's
1. R. G. Bhandarkar : Report (1883-84), Bombay, 1887, p. 51 -
Bhandarkar states that in the faruratet Bhattoji mentions several
authors and works :-
____ अनन्तभट्ट, अपरार्क, कालादर्श, ज्योतिर्निबंध, त्रिस्थलीसेतु, नारायण, नारायणवृत्ति
on आश्वलायन, निर्णयदीपिका, निर्णयामृत, पृथ्वीचंद्रोदय, प्रतापमार्तड, प्रयोगपारिजात,

ATTH.
त्रिस्थलीसेतु is a work of नारायणभट्ट. The dates of this author given
by Prof. Kane are " about A. D. 1550-1560.” (Vide., p. 556 of Hist.
of Dharma. I).

of life and literary activity between or about two sure chronologi-
cal outposts viz. A. D. 1547 and A. D. 1633-a period of 86 years.
As a result of the data recorded in the present paper we get
the following series :-

13. A Rare Manuscript of the Vedabhāşya-
sāra of Bhațțoji Dikṣita*
In the list of works recorded by Aufrecht in his Catalogus
Catalogorum under the entry' " Etretrata " no work of the name
" Tu To " or "THIRATT" is recorded. Rao Bahadur W. A.
Bambardekar also makes no mention of any such work in his
recent work? on Bhattoji while giving a complete list of Bhattoji's
works. In view of these fasts and in view also of the absence of
reliable data regarding Bhattoji's life and personality I was
interested to know from Pandit Raghunātha Krsna Pāțankar of
Rajapur that he has come across a rare MS of the Vedabhâsya-
sära of Bhattoji. Pandit Pāțankar was also kind enough to send me
a copy of this MS made by himself together with a description
* Adyar Library Bulletin 1941, Vol. V, pp. 176-180.

2. Bhajgoji Dikṣita - Jñâtiviveka, Bombay, 1939.
3. I note here for ready reference the names of 34 works as-
cribed to Bhattoji as given by Rao Bahadur Bambardekar :
___अद्वैतकौस्तुभ, आचारप्रदीप, आशौचनिर्णय, आन्हिकम्, कारिका, कालनिर्णयसंग्रहम् ,

many of the above works is well known. It is worth while examin.
ing doubtful cases.

Pāšankar is associated with the Sanskrit Pathashala at Rajapur. There
is a Collection of Sanskrit MSS at this Pathashala.
5. The MS of Vedabhāşyasära is old and in a decaying condi-
tion. It was procured by Pt. Pätankar from his guru, the late
Bālaśästri Māipkar of Kharepatan at some distance from Rajapur. The
full name of Bālaśāstri i8 “Balakrępa Lakşmapa Māinkar."

of the original.' Realizing the importance of this work for
the history of Sanskrit literature in general and for the history of
Bhațgoji's works in particular, I take this opportunity of thanking
Pandit Pāšankar for the materials for this paper sent by him and
at the same time acquainting all students of Sanskrit literature
with the contents of this work in brief.
The copy of the Vedabhäşyasāra before me consists of 16
foolscap pages (about 29 lines to a page) and begins as follows :-
वागीशायाः सुमनसः सर्वार्थानामुपक्रमे ।
ये नवा कृतकृत्याः स्युस्तं नमामि गजाननम् ॥१॥
माधवाचार्य रचितादिभाष्यमहार्णवात् ।

The colophons of the 12 vargas of the work are as follows:-

,, 6-"द्वितीयो वर्ग:"
,, 7-" तृतीयो वर्गः"
8-"चतुर्थो वर्ग:"

11-"सप्तमो धर्गः"
,, 12-" अष्टमो वर्ग:"
1. The original MS is now deposited with the Sanskrit Pathan
shala Rajapur.
2. Pandit Patankar's remarks on this manner of mentioning the
author of the Vedabhäşyasára may be noted here:-
"दीक्षितः स्वीयव्याकरणग्रंथे श्रीवेदभाष्यकाराणां माधवाचार्याणां यत्र स्वमत-
समर्थने समुल्लेखः क्रियते तत्र "वेदभाष्यकाराः" इति सादर उच्यते, यत्र तेषां खण्डनं तत्र
"यत माधवेनोक्तं" इति सामान्यतो ह्येकवचन विधीयते." If this observation is
correct we must regard the great grammarian as a " Singular"
controversialist in line with other great Pandits of his age.

The evaluation of the present work must be left to the
students of Sanskrit grammar as the comments of Bhattoji set
forth herein are preponderantly grammatical. That the present
work is Bhattoji's own production is proved hy verse 3 quoted
above, which explicitly states that Bhattoji Dikşita has composed
this Sara on the basis of the Vedabhäşya of Madhavācārya. In
the history of the commentators of the Veda this work of Bhattoji
though brief may have its own place in view of Bhattoji's reputa-
tion as a grammarian. My interest in the present work is purely
of a historical nature as I have been studying of late the historical
background of Bhattoji and his pupils and have published so far'
some papers pertaining to this field.
Bhattoji refers to the following works and authors in his
Vedabhäşyasăra :-

I have recorded above whatever data could be gathered from
the copy of the MS supplied to me by Pandit Raghunatha Sāstri
Patankar and I now leave it to scholars to see if the present MS
is a fragment of a larger work of Bhattoji of the title Vedabha sya.
såra or is a complete work by itself. It is also necessary to
examine other works of Bhattoji with a view to seeing if he quotes
this Vedabhâsyasära' in any of them.
1. " JATT " is possibly a mis-reading for " JPATH ", vide my
note on JATT ( Annals, B. O. R. Institute, Vol. XXI, 1940, p. 133
footnote 1). Battia is part of a lost work on lexicography. It is
mentioned by Nārāyaṇa Dikşita in his commentary on the Väsava-
datta, which I have assigned to the period " between A. D. 1250 und
1550". See also Aufrecht CC, I, 63. Bhattoji's reference to Jato
evidently supports my evidence. 3ATT is not recorded by Prof.
Rāmavatāra Śarmā in his list of Kośas ( Pages LV-LXII of Intro. to
Kalpadru-Kośa, Vol. I, G. O. S. Baroda, 1928 ). Perhaps someday
we may recover this lexicon.
2. Since this paper was drafted Pt. Patankar has sent me the
original MS of the Vedabhāsyasära. It consists of 9 folios
( Size; 11}" x 48"); 14 lines to a page, 55 letters to a line. The
MS is written legibly on country paper. It is quite old and worn
out. It appears to be about 250 years old and may belong to the 17th
century.
3. Dr. V. Raghavan of the Madras University of whom I in.
quired about other MSS of this work writes on 3-7-1941 :" We are not
able to find any other MS of a Vedabhäşyasāra by Bhattoji Dikşita."

LOLIMBARAJA AND HIS WORKS
81
I shall now try to record the chronological data gathered from
the available Mes of the works of Lolimbarāja mentioned by
Aufrecht in the foregoing entries.
(1) Harivilăsa
About Harivilāsa Dr. A. B. Keith' observes :- "about 1050
Lolimbarāja wrote his Harivilāsa which in Canto iii gives the usual
descriptions of seasons and in IV of Kịşņa.” If Lolimbarāja wrote
about A. D. 1050 a poem of the name Harivilāsa he must be dif-
ferent from another Lolimbarāja who composed his Vaid yajīvana
in the 17th Century as stated by Keith elsewhere (p. 511).
Aufrecht states (CC I, 761) that the Harivilāsa Kavya is quote
ed by Puruşottamadeva in his Varnadeśanā. If this statement is
correct it supports Keith's statement that Lolimbarāja wrote the
Harivilāsa about 1050 A. D. because the date of Puruşottamal as
given by Prof. Rāmāvatāra Śarmā is about the 1st half of the
12th Century.
I shall now examine some of the available MSS of the text of

2. Aufrecht (CCI, 546 ) evidently supports the identity of the
two Lolimbarājas :(1) author of Vaidyajivana and ( 2 ) the author of
Harivilāsa by including both these works under one entry.

MSS including MS dated A. D. 1624 (No. 78 of 1871-72). Verse
96 contains a reference to the poet as रस्नकलारमणस्य कवेः i.e. as hus-
band of रत्नकला, which is significant in view of the MS of रनकला-
चरित (med.) recorded by Aufrecht viz. I0. 2079 and B. 4. 234.
It is possible to surmise that the verses 96 and 97 found in the
Kāvyamālā edition of the Harivilāsa and containing the epithet
रस्नकलारमण with reference to the poet are a later interpolation.

LOLIMBARAJA AND HIS WORKS
Raghunatha states that our poet Lolimbarāja was a resident of
Junnarapattana or the town of Junnara and was an incarnation of the
goddess of the place Satyaśộnga.' It appears from this statement
that the commentator Raghunātha was aware of the association of
Lolimbarāja with Junnar in the Poona District but as we don't
know the date of Raghunātha it is difficult to determine the exact
antiquity of this association.
MS No. 425 of 1884-87 -- This is a commentary by Bhatta
Kamalakara, son of Caturbhuja. It is called Sahitya Saccandrika.
As the MS is fragmentary it is difficult to make any immediate use
of it for chronological purposes.
I have noticed the above commentaries' on the Harivilāsa
.-..-.-.--
1. Vide verses 4 and 5 on folio 1 which read as follows :-
" सत्यशृंगनिवासिनी भगवती लीलावतारोभव-
च्छीमज्जुनरपत्तनाधिवसतिर्लोलिंबनामा कविः।
तत्काव्ये भगवत्प्रिये हरिविलासाख्ये मया टिप्पणं

हरिविलासकाव्यस्य श्रीलोलिंबराजकवेः कृतौ।
नाम्ना सुबोधिनी व्याख्या रच्यने छात्रतुष्टये ॥ ५॥"
On folio 12 the commentator explains “लोलिंबानां" "वैद्यानां" and quotes
a lexicon in his support :- "लोलिपस्तु चिकित्सकः इति केशवः''। In the
colophon he refers to his guru व्यंबकराज (“ श्रीमत्त्र्यं बकराजगुरुचरणप्रसादे
प्रेरित ).
2. On folio 14 we have the following Colophon :-
" इति श्रीमच्चतुर्भुजसुतभट्टश्रीकमलाकरविरचितायां साहित्यसञ्चंद्रिकायां हरिविलास-
व्याख्यायां प्रथमसर्गः समाप्तः ।

briefly because Aufrecht records only two commentaries on this
poem only one of which is available to me viz, that by Kamalakara
noticed above.
(3) Ratnakala Caritra
Only two MSS of the Ratnakala Caritra have been recorded
by Aufrecht. The MS in the India Office Library' is described
as" a dramatic poem of 8! verses (mainly Prākrit) by Lolimba-
rāja.” This MS is vated Samvat 1708 = A. D. 1651. The inter-
locutors in this dramatic poem are Lolimmarāja, Ratnakală a Sakhi,
a budhi (?), Daulata and Atmārāma. Buhler records a MS of the
Ratnakală Caritra but he has included it in the works on Medicine.
As the poem appears to have been composed in Marāțhi its
author may have been a resident of Junnara. He may also be

identical with the TCHOTTHOfe' referred to in the verses 96 and 97
which appear to me to be an interpolation substituted in the Hari-
vilāsa in place of the verses giving the genealogy of the patron of
the author with some particulars, which yet remain to be identified.
Lolimbārāja the author of the Ratnakalacaritra referred to
above appears to be identical with Lolimbarāja about whom the
following particulars are recorded in Marathi sources :-
In the History of Marathi Literature called the Mahārāșțra
Sarasvata? by V. L. Bhave some account of poets of the “ 16th Cen-
tury” is recorded. This account furnishes the following parti-
culars about Lolimbarāja :--
Lolimbarāja is known as the author of a commentary in Marā-
thi on the 10th skandha of the Bhagavata purāņa. He was a resident
of Junnar. His surname was Joshi and his descendants are still
living in Junnar province. He wrote a Sanskrit work on medi.
cine called the Vaidyajivana. Many songs attributed to him are
found in literature and in some old MSS. He was a well-known
saint being included among the saints like उद्धवचिद्धन, रङ्गनाथ and
farartra. Devadāsaalso refers to him. The account of his early
1. The Vaidyajivana contains references to trist as follows.-
"zao 4149 FSET AS Faragrafos" I. 74.
"afa trama FIFTH SETS FIT FATHEFTI " I. 79.
"appy Tattoo at Saratoga So " III. 12.
“ TEATST ro ofis 7797271." ctc. III. 43.
"3117 Tra F5AT1FA4384757farma" IV. 46.
The Commentator Harinātha ( A. D. 1674 ) explains the name
“Trattori" as “ 39 Ft ÁT” (fol. 30 of Ms No. 913 of 1887-91). This
explanation as also his explanation of 37792 as THT34 (fol. 4 ) is
indicative of the fact that he ( as carly as A. D. 1674) was not aware
of the biographical particulars about the Deccani Lolimba rājā. In
verse 22 of Vaidyajīvana a medical preparation is named after 673T
" TUT 767acsora ĮSTUTAT etc).

Devadasa's work :

life is very interesting. He was the son of Diväkarabhtta.' In his
younger days he was of a gay temperament and given to enjoy-
ments. From a work called लोलिंबराजआख्यान it appears that he
married a beautiful young Mahommedan girl whom he named
रस्नकला. He was extremely attached to her. After her death his
outlook on life changed. He then became a devotee of सप्तश्रृङ्गाभवानी'
(Continued from the previous page)
"लोलिंबराजे करितांस्तवन । मस्तकीहून काढिले जीवन ।
भक्तवत्सल तूं भगवान । महिमा कोण वणू शके ॥"
Mr. Bhave mentions two Marathi authors of the name acta, one
of these two was the pupil of Saint Rāmadāsa, while the other was
" चैतन्यशिष्य ( Mah. Sarasvata, p. 285.)
1. In the Colophons of Mss of Vaidyajīvana Lolimbaraja is
called दिवाकरसनु. This parentage is supported by the following verse
towards the close of Vilāsa V of the Vaidyajivana (Ms No. 1093 of
1886-92, folio 338 ):-
" आयुर्वेदवचोविचारसमये धन्वन्तरिः केवलं
सीमा गानविदां दिवाकरसुधांबोधि त्रियामापतिः।
उक्तं सः कविताकृतां मतिमतां भूभृत्सभाभूषणं
कांतोक्त्या कृत वैद्यजीवनमिदं लोलिम्मराजः कविः ॥ २४॥"
The following editions of the Vaidyajivana have been publish-
ed:-(1) Bombay, 1874 ;(2) Edition with Dipika of Sukhānanda and
Bhāsyanivịtti of Mihiracandra (Sanskrit aad llindi, Venkateshwar
Press, Bombay, 1920).
2. Mr. Bhave quotes the following verses from लोलिंबराज आख्यान
(p. 169 ) :-
"ज्याची कीर्ति जगत्रई प्रगटली मन्दाकिनीचेपरी।
जो एके घटिकेत शंभर नवी पद्यं विनोदें करी॥
ज्याला 'कविपातशाह' पदवी विद्वजनी दीधली।
तो हा रत्नकले ! तुला विनवितो लोलिंवराजः कवी ॥"
3. Raghunatha in his Commentary on the Harivilāsa refers to
this goddess and our author's devotion to her as follows:--'सत्य (प्त)
भृङ्गनिवासिना भगवती लीलावतारोऽभवत् (V. 4 at beginning of MS No. 182 of
1902-07).
The Vaidyajivana refers to HYZA in verse 2 at the begginning as
follows:-

and after some penance came to be very much respected by the
people. His work“ Vaidyajivana" was composed in Saka 1555
( = A. D. 1633 ). - Mr. Bhave then describes a MS of Vaidyaji-
vana with him as follows:
All the verses in this MS' are in Marathi. The work is
narrated to his beloved. The work ends with the line :-"gla

Marāthi translation of the Sanskrit original by the author himself or
by 9914, the Commentator of the Harivilāsa, who mentions 54 Fast

Marathi Vaidyajīvana contains numerous references to one 54f6ffiT 15.

zas bear numbers 56 to 62 and are followed by the statement that
they have been taken from some other work.'
The name of the work has, however, not been indicated in the
MS. These verses appear to me to be an interpolation for the
reason that the description of the game plant as found recorded in
them presupposes the plantation? of tobacco in India about which

surprise and examined the tobacco etc.” In the beginning the
tobacco was imported into India and was considered an article of
curiosity. A gold tobacco-box was presented by the King of Siam in
A. D. 1622 to Mr. Richard Fursland,“the President of the English
nation " at Jaccatra ( vide p. 297 of the Journal of the Siam Society,

have been recorded. Asad Beg (died 1626 ) on a mission from
Akbar to Bijapur about A. D. 1603 saw tobacco for the first rime.
In A. D. 1617 Emperor Jahangir forbade its use as it had
very bad effect on the health of many people. In 1660
Tavernier speaks of its growing in large quantities near
Barhanpur.' The third MS. of the Vaidyāvatamsa as recorded in
the Ujjain MSS? Catalogue is incomplete.

I am not aware of the authority on which Mr. Bhave made his
statement that the Vaidyajīvana was composed in A. D. 1633 ( saka
1535). Prof. Velankar states that Bühler* records a MS of the
Vaidyajivana which is dated Samvat 1664 ( = A.D. 1608). If this
date of MS is correct it conflicts with the above date of composi-
tion of the Vaidyajivana given by Mr. Bhave, viz. A, D. 1633.5
Harinātha's commentary on the Vaidyajivana was composed in
Samvat 1730 = A. D. 1674. We may, therefore, safely put about
A. D. 1650 as one terminus to the date of Lolimbarāja.
Though MSS of all the commentaries on the Vaidyajivana are
not available to me for examination, I may record here the follow-
ing dates gathered from the MSS of the work in the Govt. MSS
Library at the B. O. R. Institute.

It will be seen from the above table that the oldest dated MS
of the VJ at the B. O. R. Institute is dated A. D. 1766, but this
date of MS is of no use in our chronology of Lolimbarāja's works.
In the Catalogue of Ujjain MSS a MS' of the. Vy with Rudra-
bhţta's Commentary dated Saka 1728 ( = A.D. 1806) has been
recorded.
Kielhornº records two dated MSS of the Vj; one is dated
Samvat 1810 = A.D. 1754 while the other of the commentary of
Jñānadeva or Dāmodara is dated Samvat 1669 = A. D. 1613. If this
date of a MS of Vy, viz. A.D. 1613 is correct it supports the date
A.D. 1608 of a MS of the text of the Vj, recorded by Bühler.
The cumulative effect of these two dates would enable us to push
back the date of Lolimbarāja before A. D. 1600%. This conclusion

( 1935), pp. 603-4) repeats the date of composition of Vaidyajivana
viz. Saka 1555 ( = A. D. 1633 ) given by Mr. Bhave. He further
states that Lolimbaraja's Chronology lies between Saka 1500 and 1570
i.e. Between A. D. 1578 to 1648, a period of about 70 years. According
to Mr. Pangarkar Ratnakalā was the daughter of the Yavana Subhedār
of Junnar.

based on the actual dates of MSS makes it impossible for me to
believe in the accuracy of the statement of Mr. Pangarkar that
Lolimbarāja tlourished between A.D. 1578 and 1648.
The evidence recorded so far about Lolimbarāja's works leads
me to divide it into two sections: (1) Evidence about Lolimbarāja, the
author of the poem Harivilāsa and (2) Evidence about Lolimbarāja
the author of Vaidyajivana and other works. The details of this
evidence may be best represented as follows :-

referring to the poet as
रत्नकलारमण are spurious.
(6) Verses 96 and 97 at the
end of the printed edition
of the HK are spurious as
they are not found in any
of the 8 MSS of the HK
examined by me. On the
contrary the verses reco-
rding the genealogy of the
patron of our author are:
supported by the follow-
ing MSS: -
(i) Ms referred to in No. 468
of 1884-87.
(ii) No. 377 of 1884-87 which
records the date of com-
position viz. A.D. 1583.
(iii) MS referred to by the
Editor of the Kavyamālā
Edition of the HK in
the footnote at the end
of the poem.
(iv) Tanjore MS No. 3858
contains the verse
“ sfiaTTATHI etc.”
(7) There is no evidence in
the HK to prove that its
author belonged to the
Mahārāṣtra. On the con.
trary, the patron king of
this author hailed from a
place called 97819&fift.
This king's genealogy is as
follows:- f-THTA pra-
groga (m. reeifaar) son
eta (patron of the author
of the HK).
This line belonged to
Alfarardages which is called
a furpos,
VI, VT, CC, RC. This
omission stands in vivid
contrast with the name of
king Hari referred to many
times in the HK of
Lolunlarāja l.
(5) Ratnakalā, supposed to be
the wife of this author is
referred to in the RC
which bears her name in
the Vy in which she is
addressed by name in some
verses and in the Marāthi
work ICT 377kyta, in
which our author is called
कविपातशाह.
In the VT the author
calls himself कविकुलसुलतान
as also कविपातशाह (v. 155).
The reference to the place
Fax is found in verse 2
of Vf (this may be the
सप्तशृङ्ग to the north of
Nasik). This author be-
longed to the Mahārāştra.
The commentator Hari-
nātha (A.D. 1674) having no
knowledge of the सप्तशत
hill near Nasik wrongly
explains the expression
"ARTET" as “ FA YA
हिमालये एव आस्पदं स्थानं यस्य
aq" (fol. 4 of MS 913
of 1887-91). Rudrabhatta
explains the expression as
" ACTR3: qaa: etc."
(fol. 3 of MS No. 463 of
1895-98).

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
I hope the evidence recorded in this paper about Lolimbarāja
and his works will enable scholars' to clarify some of the issues
raised in this study but which still require more evidence to
enable us to arrive at definite decisions. I have tried to put to-
gether whatever information I could get from the sources so far
available to me with a view to helping a more detailed examination
of the several works of Lolimbarāja than what I have been able to
carry out in the preparation of this tentative study.
1. Since this paper was drafted Dr. V. Raghavan of the Cata-
logus Catalogorum office, Madras University, has sent to me the in-
formation recorded by his office regarding Lolimbarāja and his works.
Some of this information may be recorded here :-
(1) Edition of Harivilăsa-Kavya ( Pandit, II ) - Here the
editor makes Lolimbarăja a contemporary of Bhoja,
(2) There are numerous MSS of the Harivilāsa, in none of
which we find the chronogram ( = A. D. 1583) found in
the B. O. R. Institute -- 2 MSS.
(3) In the Vaidyajīvana Lolimba describes himself as pro-
ficient in Vaidyaka, Kavya and Music. No MS of a music
work of Lolimba has yet been found.
(4) In the South Indian MSS of the Vaidyajīvana ( Trien.
Cata. No. 2221 , 2371, 2844 ( a ) the work is called
“Sadvaidyajivana."
(5) In Madras MS No. 2371 referred to above the colophon
Bays that Lolimba was the son of king of Muñja of
Vidarbha.
(6) Rudrabhaçţa, the commentator on the Vaidyajivana, was
the son of Koneribhatta who was doctor to one Khan
Khan and Rudra himself wrote under Mirkhân. If the
identity of these two Khānas is proved we may have some
external datum for Lolimba's date limits. “I am thank-
ful to Dr. Raghavan for the information sent by him.

A BIG ANTHOLOGY OF SRNGĀRA VERSES BY RĀMA
AND ITS RARE MANUSCRIPT DATED A. D. 1556
Recently I sent for publication a paper on the date of an anony-
mous anthology of the title Subhāṣita-muktāvali composed some
time before A.D. 1600. While examining IS in the Goverr ment
MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute under this title 1 came
across the following ViS which is duted Sauvat 1612 ( = A.D. 1556)
and hence very useful to the students of the history of Sanskrit
Subhāsita literature :--
No. 92 of 1883-84 ( सुभापितमुक्तावली-शनारालाप), folios about 82,
appearance old, well preserved, पृष्टमात्राs used occasionally. The
MS begins :-
" ॐ ॥ नमो श्री मकरध्वजाय ॥

1. This verse is identical with verse 43 on p. 268 of सुभाषित-
रत्नभाण्डागार (N. S. Press, Bombay, 1911), which reads as follows:--
" श्रोणीबंधस्त्यजति तनुतां सेव्यते मध्यभागः

The foregoing description of the rare MS of the TITET of
Furreageraret discloses the following facts about this work and
its importance :-
(1) The total number of verses in this big anthology on Love
(Śrngāra) is about 1145 as can be seen from the following table :

Page 134****************************************************************************************
ŠķNGÅRÄLÅPA
103
This is perhaps the biggest anthology on Love devoted to
Śrrigăra alone.
(2) The date of this MS No. 92 of 1883-84 ( irrara) is
Samvat 1612 = A.D. 1556, as recorded in the olophon at the end.
(3) The MS was written by one anisa ra in his own hand
( Farfa) and for his own study ( 77 grata). TIH gives the
genealogy of his trista family as follows :-
HT ( TIẾT )
Son
धरणीधर
Son
कामा
Son
ETTE
Son
गणेश
Son
TTA ( who copied the MS in A.D. 1556 )
(4) As regards the name of the author I have to state that I
could not trace his name anywhere except in the following verse on
folio 55 at the end of the 7th Chapter of the ITTITIETT:-
" इदं शतं पुण्यकृतात्मनो(ति ! ) प्रियं
प्रतीक्षणं चैत्र विलोकनीयं ।
मयोद्धृतं सादरकेण नाम्ना
TIÀO di sosiaa till
The author states that this 7th Chapter of 100 verses or so was
composed by him, of the name Trh ( 91... AFI TIÀO 3 ) of a re-
spectable family. Evidently this TI# is the author of the entire
anthology of 1145 verses.
(5) We have seen above that TIA TŪET of the arisan family copi-
ed this MS in A.D. 1556 with his own hand and for his own study.
It is possible to suggest that this very IR (AT ) is identical with
कुलीन राम, the author of the शृंगारालाप. He has recorded the genealogy
of his parents for six generations. This fact perhaps explains why he
calls himself pota in the verse quoted above. If the above identity
is accepted this very unsas # becomes the author of this rare

Page 135****************************************************************************************

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
anthology and the date of its composition becomes identical with
A.D. 1556, the date of the copy before us. Possibly this is an
autograph copy of the anthology compiled by ITA grist from several
previous works.
(6) Rāma, the author of this anthology, has taken care to tell
us in 8 verses (verses 99-106 at the end of Chapter VIII) that
Sủngāra or Love is holy (Pre 7). It is the giver of pleasure and
prosperity (सुखद and पुष्टिवाईन. ) It indicates good fortune (सोभाग्यद).
In fact the author beleives that Love is the essence of life and
consequently an anthology devoted to Sğrgāra is the best an-
thology ("' spätie T eret ajoria I 16."). A man loses all inter-
est in life without Love ( TITO raat 737 era à TATTETE: "'). The
author, therefore, exhorts his readers to read his present collec-
tion of Sğrgāra verses (FYTITETE) frequently for pleasure and profit.'
(7) As Love is the central theme of this anthology the author
appropriately invokes the God of Love at the beginning of each
Chapter with varied epithets such as 779714, FJH27717, HEFTİS-
ART, FITNETT, TATT910, wat hart, go7919727, etc. He is confident
that this anthology will stimulate love among married couples as
it is an elixir in the absence of which a man must remain ever
thirsty ("लोके प्रसिद्धं तथा रम्यं दंपत्योः प्रीतिवर्द्धन । न पिबेदमृतचेदं संसारे सतृषो
Ha 11311")
(8) The author does not record the names of the works from
which he has drawn for his anthology, I note below some
names of works and authors which came to my notice during my
study of the timestT:-
TATIZE — fol. 26, 65, 76
torta — fol. 34, 48
Tuđa (qaiyai) - fol. 48

The name of factor in the above list enables us to fix about
A.D. 1100 as the earlier limit to the date of 1919 as the Kashmi-
rian author faceut, who is probably identical with PERO mentioned
here, flourished between A.D. 1030 and 1100.
As regards zittita* from which our author quotes on folios
34 and 18 I have to point out that it is identical with similares of
to or 7.74€ as the following evidence will show :-
Verses 81 and 82 on folio 48 of ziiTTEIT MS read as follows:-
"शंगारतिलको नाम ग्रंथोयं ग्रथितो मथा।
व्युत्पत्तये निषेवंते कवयः कामनिश्चयं ॥ ८१ ।।
काननी काव्यकथा कीहक वैदग्धी को रसागमः ।
ca niet fagů: an sinrafamuth 11 620"
These verses are found at the end of B. O, R. Institute MS of
POTTIST of (No. 217 of 1832-83) as follows :-
" शंगारतिलको नाम ग्रंथोयं रचितो मया ।
व्युत्पत्तये निषेवत कवयः कामिनः स्वयं ॥ ८२ ॥
काम्या काव्यकथा कीदृक् वदग्ध्ये को रसागमः।
किं गोष्टीमंटनं हंत शंगारतिलकाहते ॥ ८३॥"
It is clear from the above verses, which are practically the
saie in the MSS of FITTITTIT and intense of that the author
of the anthology is indebte I to for these verses. The B. O, R.
I. MS of juridt 5 which contains these verses is dated Samvat 1654
= A.D. 1599. The work has been printed in the Kavyamala Series
Pt. III, 1887.
The identity of an or HE, the author of fair fast, with age the
author of 16376 177 who flourished in the first-half of the 9th
Century has been questioned by some scholars, but Dr. J. B.
Chaudhuri' observes that “as early as 1200 A.D. Rudrata and Rudra,
authors of the Kavyālamkāra and the Srngära-tilaka, were consi-
dered to be identical."
The present MS of TTTTOTT dated A.D. 1556 is very important
as all verses in it are earlier than this date. Without a Pratika

Index to all the verses in this big anthology it is impossible to
trace them to their sources. On a cursory comparison of some of
these verses with those in the H ateauroGPIT (N.S. Press, 1911 )
I find them recorded in this compendium but unfortunately this
record is useless for our purpose as the sources of these verses
are not indicated by the compilers.
It is difficult to edit this anthology on the basis of the single
MS but this task would be easy if a Pratika Index to the entire
anthology is first prepared and then used for tracing many of the
verses in earlier sources. Such an Index would give us a chrono.
logical control over the materiil incorporated in this anthology and
in this way the work of reconstructing the history of our Sanskrit
anthological literature would be facilitated. My friend Dr. E. D.
Kulkarni, M.A., Ph.D., has agreed 10 my suggestion for the pre-
paration of such a Pratika Index and let me hope that he will start
his work on it in the near future.
The rare MS of the Singārālapa described here discloses the
following evidence regarding the chronology of this anthology :-
(1) Most probably Rāma, the author of the anthology, is
identical with Räma Yajnika who copied the whole MS in his own
hand in A.D. 1556. If this statement is correct, the date of this
work is A.D. 1556.
(2) Even if the above identity of the author and the scribe is
not accepted we can assign the anthology to the period, A.D. 1100
-1556, as it mentions Bilhaņa of the 11th Century on the one hand
and is represented by a MS of A.D. 1556 on the other. More
evidence in support of these limits can be furnished only when the
several verses in the anthology are traced to their sources.

Aufrecht records under ETAT the works Rudraj apabhāşya, and

dhara. Dr. Lakshman Sarup' assigned the author of the Vedadipa
to the 12th century on the basis of an inscriptiona dated 1175 A. D.
in whlch two villages have been given by Jayacandradeva of Kanoja
to one Hrşikeśı Sarman who is described as the grandson of “ HET-
grea A&TTT” (High). Two years ago I had an occasion to read
Dr. Sarup's remarks about an early date for Mahid hara viz. the
beginning of the 12th century. His remarks in connection with
the identity of the two Mahidharas failed to convince me in the
absence of any other corroborative evidence except the
similarity of names. I had, therefore, made some study of the
available works of Mahidhara with a view to seeing if Dr. Sarup's
date for Mahidhara is correct or otherwise. Recently, however,
Mr. K. M. K. Sırma of the Adyar Library, published a papers
on the “ Rudrabhâsya and date of Mahidhara and Verkațanātha.”
In this paper Mr. Sarma makes the following remarks about
Mahidhara's date as given by Dr. Sarup :-
“On the basis of an inscription which mentions a Mahīdhara
Prof. Sarup assigns our author to the beginning of the 12th century
(Indices and Appendices to the Nirukta, pp. 73–74). This date
cannot be accepted for this Mahidhara whose Mantramahodadhi
bears at the end the chronogram 372 fagnat ha agarrara ( 1654
= A. D. 1597). The invocation to Lakşmințsimha at the beginn-

3. This copperplate grant was discovered 60 miles north-east

4. Aufrecht's identity of the authors of the Vedadīpa and the
Mantramahodadhi is also repeated by Keith and Winternitz ( Cata. of
Bodleian Mss, 1905 ) p. 36 - " Mahidhara wrote in A. D. 1598 the
Vişnubhaktikalpalatåprakāśa ( Weber, Cata. I. 158 ) and the Mantra-
Mahodadhi in A. D. 1589 ( Bodl. Cata. p. 99) or 1597, Bendall

ing of both the Mantramahodadhi' and the Vidadipa is proof of
the identity of the author.”
__ In the B. O. R. Institute Mss of the Mantramahodadhi the
date of composition is given as बाणवेदनृपैर्मिते = A. D. 1589 (Sam,
1645). I shall now consider the verses of invocation in the other
works of Mahid hara :--
(I) The कास्यायनशुल्बसूत्रमार (B. O. R. Institute Ms No. 653
of Vis. I. It contains a reierence to Nrsimha as will be seen from
the verse at the commencement which reads -
1. Ms of the Mantramahodadhi ( No. 653 of Viś. I at the B.O.R.
Institute begins :-
"प्रणम्य लक्ष्मी नृहरि महागणपतिं गुरुम् ।
तंत्राण्यनेकान्यालोक्य वक्ष्ये मन्त्रमहोदधिम् ॥"
The Vedadipa begins :-
"प्रणम्य लक्ष्मी नृहारं गणेशं
भाष्यं विलोक्यौवटमाधवीयम् ।
यजुर्मनूनां विलिखानि चार्थ
परोपकाराय निजेक्षणाय ॥"
[ See शुक्लयजुर्वेदसंहिता ( वाजसनेयी माध्यंदिन) with commentaries by उवट
and महीधर - N. S. Press, Bombay, 1912 ].
The objective identity of the 1st line of the Mantramahodadhi
with the 1st line of the Vedadipa is not accidental. It proves the
identity of authorship for both the works as pointed out by
Mr. Sarma.
2. In the British Mus. Ms of मन्त्रमहोदधिटीका ( नौका) the chrono-
gram of the date of composition is " सायकवेदभूपति" = A. D. 1589
( Vide p. 46 of Bendall's Cata. 1902 ).
3. Ms No. 363-of 1883-84 ( B. O. R. I. ) of the Bhāşya contains
its date of composition viz. Sunday 8th March 1590 = Samvat 1646
Ravivära, Trayodasi. (Ind. Ephemeris, Vol. V, p. 382.) The
chronogram of this date is found in the colophon of the Ms which
reads as follows:-
"रसवेदांगभूवर्षे भाष्यते धषले दले।

" श्रीनृसिंहं नमस्कृत्य रमेशं भक्तवत्सलं ।
शुरुषस्य विवृति वश्मि भाष्यवृत्यनुसारिणी ॥"
The "रामकृतावृत्ति" referred to by Mahidhara in verse 3 of the con-
cluding verses of the कात्यायनशुल्बसूत्रभाष्य was composed by रामचन्द्र
वाजपेयिन् , who composed his कुण्डाकृति in A. D. 1489 (See Aufrecht
CCI, 513) or A. D. 1449 ( Kane H. D. Vol. I, p. 534).
(II) In the concluding verses of Mahidhara's faepur on the
योगवासिष्ठसार we find a reference to god नृसिंह or "नरकेसरी" in the
following extract:-
Ms No. 75 of 1882-83 --- folio 71-" इति श्रीयोगवासिष्ठसार-
विवरणे महीधरकृते दशम प्रकरणं ॥१०॥

The above Ms is dated Samvat 1775%DA. D. 1719. Another
MS of Mahidhara's विवरण ' on the योगवासिष्ठसार viz. No. 74 of
1882-83 is dated “संवत् १७३०" = A.D. 1674. On folio 1 of this Ms
we have the endorsement “यतींद्रमधुसूदनस्यायं योगवासिष्ठसारः शिवाय
'प्रदतः" Ms No. 279 of 1892-95 is dated Samvat 1808 = A. D. 1752.
(III) Mahidhara mentions God Teft in the following verse
( Continued from the previous page )
विदुषां सुखबोधाय व्यधाबुध्यनुसारतः।
भाष्यं रामकृतां वत्तिं सूत्राण्यालोच्य तत्त्वतः ॥३॥
नीलकंठो रमानाथः सिताभः चन्द्रशेखरः।

(V) The invocation of the ईशावास्योपनिषनाप्य of महीधर reads as
follows:-
1. The following verse at the end of the Ms contains the chro-
nogram of the date ( श्रुति, बाण, रस, इन्दु).
"श्रुतिबाणरसेन्दुमानवर्षे
नभसि स्कन्ददिने सितेऽर्कवारे ।
महिदासबुधो गिरीशपुरयां
कृतवान्कल्पलताप्रकाशतां हि ॥"
In the Ms (No. 63 of 1886-92) of पुरुषसूक्तटीका by महीधर I do not
find any reference to नृसिंह. The Ms of शतरुद्रिय होम ( No. 82 of 1886.92)
ends as follows:
"श्रीमन्महीधरकृते वेददीपमनोहरे।
शतसद्रियहोमोऽयं षोडशोध्याय इरितः ।

2. The invocation at the commencement of the work is as
follows:-
"गणेशं कमलानार्थ प्रणिपत्य गुरोः पदं।
करिष्ये रामगीताया व्याख्यान बालबोधये ॥१॥"
3. The chronogram नभस , अग, षड, रूप - Sam. 1660 (month of
Asvina, Krenapaksa and Sunday (भगाही). This date may correspond
to 16th or 23rd October 1603 ( Vide p. 9 of Vol. VI of Indian Ephe-
meris ). Aufrecht has recorded only two dates of composition of
two different works of HETETT viz. A. D. 1589 and 1597. The above
chronogram gives us A. D. 1603 as the 3rd date of composition of
Mahidhara's work रामगीताटीका.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE WORKS OF MAHIDHARA 113
Ms No. 113 of 1882-83 dated Samvat 1778 = A.D. 1722, -fol.1
"मृसिंह गणपतिं वाणीं नत्वा गुरुपदांबुजं ।
चतुर्विशतेऽध्याये वेददीपोऽधुनोच्यते ॥"
From the uniform references to god ime in his works it
appears that artat was specially devoted to this god and hence it
is but natural that this god should be invoked in the data as also
in the मन्त्रमहोदधि and other works of महीधर.
In addition to the identity of invocations at the beginning of
the वेददीप and मन्त्रमहोदधि Mr. Sarma urges against Dr. Sarup's date
for महीधर the identity of the genealogy' of महीधर as recorded by
him in the वाजसनेयसंहिताटीका called वेददीप and also the मन्त्रमहोदधि.
Both these works give an identical genealogy as follows :-
1. This date is recorded on folio 20- "संवत १७७८ वर्षे माघ शुदी
गुरवा लेखः"
Folio 25 " इति षडंगरूद्रजपभाष्यं भट्टमहीदासविरचितं समाप्त"
The B. 0. R. I. No. 63 of 1886-92 is महीधर's भाष्य on the पुरुषसूक्त.
It does not contain any reference to god qrát either at the beginning
or at the end. It ends - " वेददीपे महीधरकृते."
____2. This is given in the Vedadipa, as also in the Mantrama-
hodadhi :
" श्रीमद्वत्सऋषः कुले समभवरला (द्रत्ना) करः पण्डितः

The above identity of genealogy furnished by both the Veda-
dipa and the Mantramahodadhi is a conclusive proof of the identity
of authorship for both the works, one of which was composed in
A.D. 1589.
In the Mantramahodahi Mahid hara refers to a son of his, called

mpose the Mantramahodahi in A. D. 1589.2

the Vedadipa :-
No. 37 of 1879-80 - Saka 1672 = A. D. 1750.
No. 10 of A. 1881-82 - Sam. 1858 = A. D. 1802.
No. 32 of 1879-80 - Sam. 1728 = A. D. 1672.

This appears to be the earliest dated Ms of the Vedadipa copied
in A.D. 1615 i.e. 12 years after HE TUTT's composition of the triaTETAT
in A. D. 1603. The India Office Mss of the Vedadipa bear the date
Samvat 1791 = A. D. 1735 ( Vide p. 29 of Ind. Office Cata. Part I,

been copied from an original copy dated Sam. 1690 = A. D. 1634
( Vide p. 37 of Bendall's Cata. 1902 ).

This reference by the learned father to his son proves that the

to his own father IT as a devotee of god g arage and also to
his grandfather TACIA who was a devotee of god Rāmacandra. He
also records the date of composition of the work viz. Samvat 1644
(= A. D. 1587 mentioned by Aufrecht). He belonged to the afe-
GT line.' Mahid hara also mentions this line of Brahmans “S71839,
(9599, Ja Ta, :" in the Mantramahodadhi. Mr. Nanda
Lal Dey (p. 2 of Geogr. Dictionary, 1927) identifies S1987 with
Ramnagar, 20 miles west of Bareli in Rohilkhanda. In the Plates of
Gayādatungadeva (J. P. A. S. B. Vol. V, pp. 348 ff) the grantees are
certain Brahmans who originally came from Ahicchatra and settled
in Odra-visaya. In a Jain rock inscription? of A. D. 1170 (5th Fe-
bruary ) reference is made to one THP, a Brahman of the Tetita in
BiT8n97. It appears to me that Mahidhara and his son Kalyāna,
who state that they belong to the S11E87 line and the Tata were
descended from the line of Brahmans in अहिछत्रपुर having the वत्स-
Tia referred to in A. D. 1170. If this view is accepted we have to
state that his line flourished at Ahicchatra (or Ramnagar) for no
less than 400 years and Mahidhara left his country and went to

1. On p. 219 of Notices (Vol. II, 1874) Rajendralal Mitra
describes Ms No. 818 of a Spa and observes :-" The author was
born in Ahichatra but the work was completed at Benares on Sunday
the full moon of Srāvana in the Saka year 644 = A. D. 720." These
remarks are quite wrong as the Chronogram, viz. Ir, aa, TT, 3119127 =
1644 and not 644 as stated by Mitra. The exact date appears to be
Sunday, 28th July 1588 ( vide Ind.: Ephemeris Vol. V, p. 379). The
Ms described by Mitra has the reading “ Tatara: " which is
obviously a wrong reading for " अहिछत्रान्वये जातः" found in the oldest
copy of the work of A. D. 1626 which records the verse correctly
as follows :-
"अहिछत्रान्वये जात: पंडितकशिरोमणिः।

Benares,' say between A.D. 1575 and 1590 for spiritual reasons
after having passed his early life at Ahicchatra (or Ramnagar ).
As a result of the foregoing discussion we are in a position to
reconstruct the genealogy of Mahidhara as follows :-
रत्नाकर-c. A. D. 1490 (of वत्सगोत्र ; at अहिछत्र)
Son
रामदास or रामभक्त alias फनुभट्ट (at अहिछत्र)-C.A.D. 1520.
Son
ARTET - Between 1540 and 1610 A. D. (at Benares )
I pupil of time ( Son of Keśava)
Son
107. - Between 1575 and 1640 A. D. (at Benares).
The dates of composition of the works of Mahidhara and his
sun Kalyāṇa recorded in this paper, together with the dates of M88
of these works noticed by me are given below with a view to faci.
litating further study of the chronology of the works for which no
dates could be fixed by me in this study :--
1. Cf.“ Pasiezi oferiu pat 977TOTT GETÆ ” ( Mantra mahodadhi)
It:appears that Mahidhara's son Kalyāņg also migrated to Benares
along with his father and carried on his literary pursuits at this scat
of:learning.
2. Cf. Aufrecht CC 1, 515—" TITH or TTAAT Son of Ratnākara
father of Mahidhara, grandfather of Kalyāņa :( Bälatantra (1587)
L. 818, Oxf, 100%.”
3. Aufrecht CCI, 86 makes the following entry :-
"FATTHET a contemporary of Mahidhara ( 1589 ) Oxf. 1000."
Evidently the above entry is based on the wrong reading of Oxford
•Ms wherein we have " कल्याणाभिधसूत्रेण" instead of “ कल्याणाभिधपुत्रेण."
Mahidhara is here referring to his son Kalyāņa. There was no such
person as ficat1775. This is only a comedy of errors.

ther he composed works pertaining to subjects not covered up by
the list of his works recorded by Aufrecht is a matter for investi.
gation. There is reason to believe in the identity of Mahidhara

lowing entries made by Aufrecht need to be examined :-

“नत्वा लक्ष्मीनृपंचास्यं हेरंबं भारती रविं।
लीलावतीविवरणं वक्ष्ये गुरुकृपावशात् ॥"
The date of composition of the बृहज्जातकविवरण is Saka 1520 =
A. D. 1598 as recorded in Ms No. 342 of 1882-83 (A. D. 1745).

CHRONOLOGY OF THE WORKS OF MAHIDHARA
121
In view of the date recorded in this paper I would request Dr.
Sarup to re-examine his date for Mahidhara:viz. 12th Century and
give us his final opinion on the question of Mahidhara's date in the
light of any other independent evidence which he may have gathered
since the publication of his paper in support or otherwise of the
views already expressed by him. I have not succeeded so far in
finding out any evidence in support of an early date for Mahidhara
but on the contrary I have recorded ample evidence in this paper to
prove that Mahīdhara flourished between A.D. 1530 and 1610 or so.'
(Continued from the previous page)
Ms No. 41 (चरणव्यूह with भाष्य of महीदास ) is described with the
remark “D. C. C. Samvat 1613.” If this is date of composition we have
to take A. D. 1557 as the date of composition of this 7164, which
agrees with heat's lifetime say between A. D. 1540 and 1610 as fixed
by me. If this date is the date of the Ms I find it difficult to harmonise
it with the lifetime of our Mahidhara, the author of the Vedadipa
and the Mantramahodadhi. Onp. 10 of the List of Ujjain Mss
( 1936 ) we find the following entry :-
“ No. 226 - 7 TOTOYETETT by HETETA ( FITTÀ )
( FTS ) 09&03 (107) Fahrt
(copied in ) 8 0987$- qo's
It appears from the above entry that Samvat 1603 = A. D.
1547 is the date of composition of Mahidhara's 7767 on the auaya
while according to the entry in the Baroda Cata, quoted above the
date of composition of this work appears to be A. D. 1557. I am
unable to verify these dates at present as the Mss at Ujjain and
Baroda are not before me. In case, however, we can prove this
महीदास to be identical with महीधर the author of the वेददीप and other
works we shall have to fix his life-time between say A. D. 1530 and.
1610, a period of 80 years, which is not an impossibility as his son
$ Tot composed a work in A. D. 1587.
1. After this paper was composed by the press I had an occa-
sion to consult Prof. Bhagavadatta's History of Vedic Literature ( in
Hindi ) Lahore, 1931, pp. 92-95. I am glad to find that Prof.
Bhagavadatta's criticism of Dr. Sarup's date for Mahidhara though
brief coincides with mine and is justified by the evidence gathered
in this paper.

17. “Akāśabhairava-Kalpa, an unknowi.
Source of the History of Vijayanagara* 1
In 1926 the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of Poona
procured a copy of a Manuscript called the Akasabhairava kalpa'
from the Sarasvati Mahal Manuscript Library of Tanjore. This is
a modern copy prepared for the Institute from MS No. 67072 of
the Tanjore Library. Dr. Burnell has included this MS in the
manuscripts on Tantrik literature and has given a short notice of
it in his catalogue. He observes thus" This (MS) contains
in a dialogue between Siva and Pārvati, the Sâmrājyalakşmipithikā
but ends abruptly in patala 136. Gr. 3900. It describes the
worship of Sämrāj yalakşmi and then goes on to describe how a
king's palace should be built ; what kind of elephants and weapons
etc. he should possess. Patala 29 describes the way of laying out
his city.", The MS contains 132 folios. Dr. Burnell also refers
to other copies of this work which appear to be fragmentary. My
present paper is based on MS No.6707 and not on other fragmen-

tary copies of the work mentioned by Burnell under Nos. 6708.10
and 6715-17 in his catalogue.
It will be seen from the analysis of this MS in the present
paper that the work has no connection · whatsoever with Tantrik
literature proper , and that the game Akāśabhairavakalpa given to
it in the colophons' is quite misleading. It appears from the
colophons that the author planned a big work with the title Akäsa.
bhairavakalpa of which the fragment before us ( 136 patalas = 537
pages of the B. O. R. I. copy) is a portion with the title Samra-
jyalakşmipithika which may be translated as a line or tradition of
Imperial glory.' Though the subject-matter of the work is put in
the form of a dialogue between Siva and Pārvati it can hardly be
called Tantrik as will be seen from the topics of the several
patalas noted below :-

It will be seen from the foregoing list of the contents of the
several patalas of this big compendium that the central figure of
the entire work is the king, and each chapter or patala prescribes
or describes what the king should do and what he should not do.
The work appears to be designed somewhat like a manual on
Indian polity with special reference to the practices current at the
time the work was composed. The entire subject-matter has been
standardised and generalised in such a manner that the manual
should be of use to any Hindu king who wants to follow the Hindu
code of ethics, religion and politics. The work deals with the
worship of the goddess of sovereignty (Sämrajyalakṣmi ), and pre.
scribes elaborate details of ritual to be carried out by the sovereign.
About twenty patalas of the present treatise are devoted to this
subject-matter which is followed by the description of the for-
tresses to be constructed by the king as also fortresses to be
avoided by the king. We have also a description of the several
ramparts of the fortresses and towns. One chapter is devoted to
the detailed lines to be followed by the sovereign in laying out
his capital and the construction of several buildings therein includ.
ing the royal pavilions, the palaces with innumerable apartments
including the inner apartments for ladies. The treatise also pre-
scribes the auspicious marks of the sovereign and the necessity of
his visits to the holy places with a schedule of his duties to be per-
formed at these places. Description is also given of the military
expeditions of the king. All this subject-matter closes with patala
40. From patala 41 onwards we get a description of the several
religious festivals to be performed with all eclat by the sovereign
during the course of a year. These include the festivals to be per-
formed on the New Year's day, the celebrated Råmanavami
festival, the Krsnajayanti festival, the Navaratra festival with
special reference to Vijayadasami, the Diväli festival, the Holi
festival styled as the Kámavrata in which the image of god Cupid
is painted on a piece of cloth and taken in a procession through the
city. One chapter gives us a list of seventy two public servants,
beginning with the prime minister and ending with the Pithamar.

118 deal with the riot, the elephants devoted to the exposition
daka. A chapter is devoted to the exposition of the 64 arts. Chap-
ters 84-104 are devoted to the description of N påbhișeka or the
coronation of the sovereign and all the ritual coonected with it to-
gether with some information about the construction of the royal
throne and the manner of its occupation by the sovereign. Ch. 111
deals with the characteristics of the sovereign and Ch. 112 is
devoted to the description of the characteristics of the Rajamahişi
or the queen consort. Ch. 113 deals with rājaniti or polity. Chs.
114-118 deal with the component parts of the king's military equip.
ment such as the chariot, the elephants, 'the horses, foot-soldiers,
bows and arrows. Ch. 119 is specially devoted to the study and
practice of archery. Chs. 120–21 are devoted to the exposition
of the art of warfare. Chs. 122 to 136 deal with the daily routine
of the king from morn till eve including his morning duties, listen-
ing to the Purāņas, conversation with poets, learned men and
singers and taking counsel of ministers on matters of state. Chs.
128–29 describe the midday programme of the king including a
description of the royal dinner with all its grandeur in company of
the ladies of the royal house-hold. Ch. 130 deals with evening
duties of the king. Ch. 131 deals with the king's attendance at a
dancing performance which is followed by the king's moon-light
diversions in the company of ladies of the harem. Ch. 134 is
devoted entirely to a detailed description of the royal hunt and the
king's return to the capital for washing away his sins consequent
upon this hunt by making gifts of cows, land and gold.
I have described in brief the nature and extent of this elabo-
rate treatise with a view to emphasising its importance as a source-
book for the inner life of the Vijaynagara Empire as observed by
the author of the treatise whose name cannot unfortunately be
traced in the fragment before us. It remains for me now to adduce
my reasons for the connection of this treatise with the Vijayana-
gara Empire.
It may be observed at the out-set that the treatise nowhere
refers to any of the kings of Vijayanagara by name. We also do
not find in the treatise any mention of any place specifically be.
longing to the ancient domain of the Vijayanagara Empire. This
absence of nomenclature, geographical and historical, makes the
problem of proving the connection of this treatise with the history
of the Vijayanagara Empire still more difficult. I shall, however,
attempt to record in this paper whatever proofs of a general nature
I have noticed during a cursory study of this fragment, which leave
no doubt that the troatiso is connected with the social and political

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
back-ground of the Vijayanagara Empire to which Dr. B. A. Sale.
tore has devoted two ponderous volumes.
(1) In the whole of the treatise there are only three refer.
ences to Vijayapura. These are found in the following verses :-
Patala 3, p. 12 -
___ "क्षीरसागरमध्यस्थे श्वेतद्वीपेऽतिविस्तृते ।
विजयाण्ये पुरे रम्ये चिन्तामणिगृहाप्रतः॥"
Here we get a description of the installation of the goddess of
sovereignty (Sâmrajyalakṣmi ). We are told that it should be
installed in the town called Vijayapura, which I believe is identi.
cal with Vijayanagara. The second verse which is almost identi-
cal with the above verse is found towards the close of the fragment
and reads as under :-
Pațata 136, p. 534 -
"क्षीराब्धिमध्ये श्वेताख्ये मनोज्ञे द्वीपनायके।
विजयाख्ये पुरे रम्ये चिन्तामाणिग्रहान्तरे ॥"
In this verse also the author gives us a description of the
goddess of sovereignty and the place of its installation, which is a
town called Vijayapura. I have not been able to make out exactly
what is meant by the expression fara ridge in front of which the
gooddess of sovereignty is to be installed. Most probably the
expression refers to a royal palace called by this name. This in-
ference, however, needs contemporary corroboration.
The name Vijayapura has been also applied to the modern Bija-
pur in the poetical works of the 17th century. For instance Jayarama-
kavi in his poem called the Parņālaparvatagrahaņākhyāna' while
describing the capture of the Panhala fort by Sivāji, very ofen uses
the name Vijayapura for Bijapur as will be seen from the follow-
ing verse :-
Chapter IV, v. 80 —
" विजयपुरपतिस्तद्वपाताभिघात.
प्रचुरतरकठोरा रावमाकर्ण्य तूर्णम् ।
सचिवपदमदेनाप्युद्धतः क्रुद्धपूर्वान-

In this verse Khavāskhān is styled as Vijayapurapati or the master
of Bijapur. As the poem under reference was composed by Jaya-
rāmakavi in Saka 1595 ( i. e. A. D. 1673 ) we must look upon this
usage as a 17th century usage of the term Vijayapura as equal to
Bijapur. We must, therefore, record a usage of the identity of
Vijayapura and Vijayanagara in support of our conjecture that the
Akāśabhairavakalpa in the two verses quoted above means by
Vijayapura the town of Vijayanagara and not the modern town of
Bijapur. Dr. Saletore in his two volumes already mentioned refers
to an inscription' which is contemporaneous with Vijayanagara his-
tory. In this inscription we find the name Vijayapura used for a
town in the domains of the Vijayanagar Empire and as this is an
earlier usage of the term Vijayapura I am of opinion that it sup-
ports to a certain extent my identity of the terms' Vijayapura and
Vijayanagara as adumbrated above.
The third reference to Vijayapura and to the royal palace-
called Cintamani in the midst of it is found in pațala 2, p. 7 as will
be seen from the following verses :-
" मध्ये दुग्धाम्बुधेः श्वेतो नामास्ति द्वीपनायकः ।
लक्षयोजनविस्तारः सप्तप्राकारशोभितः ॥
कुट्टिमौषप्रभाजालपाटलीकृतदिङ्मुखः ।

तन्मध्येऽस्ति गृह रम्यं चिन्तामणिसमाह्वयं ।
हेमप्रकारसवीतं बहुकक्ष्याभिरन्वितं ॥"
The expression faralafFAIR as applied to te in the verses
quoted above leaves no doubt that Cintāmaņi was the name of the

-- God Rāmanātha of Vijayapura is referred to in an inscription ( E.C.
IV, Gu. 34, p. 42, text p. 106 ). I have not verified if this Vijayapura
is identical with Vijayanagara. This Vijayapura is different from
Bijapur and was apparently situated within the ancient domains of the
Vijayanagara Empire Cf. faglige = Bijapur, Sources of Vijayanagar

royal palace as suggested by me already. It would be possible
to identify this name in the contemporary records.
(2) Dr. Saletore has emphasized the fact that the Vijaya-
nagara kings upheld the system of administration based on the
Hindu varnāśramadharma.' In the Akasabhairavakalpa also we
find this system recommended to the king in patala 56, pages
176-77 as will be seen from the following verses :-
"जात्युत्कर्षापकर्षों च विमृश्य च मुहुर्मुहुः ।
Fifaaiziureri AISIITTIHA# 11
जात्या श्रेष्ठोऽथवा हीनो यः कश्चित्स्वीयवर्मनी ।
संचरेत्तं सदा शोध्य तत्रैव परिपालय ॥
व्यत्तम्ताचारभेदे तु यः कश्चिदनुवर्तते ।
तं संशिक्ष्य यथापूर्व संस्थाप्य परिपालय ॥
चतुर्वर्णाश्रमस्थानां तारतम्यमवेक्ष्य च ।
तत्तद्वर्णानुगुण्येन परामृश्यैव पालय ॥"
We know as a matter of history that the Vijayanagara empire
stood as a bulwark of Hinduism against Mohamadanism for more
than two centuries. The system of varnīsramadharma or division
of society according to four classes being of the very essence of
Hinduism was enforced by the Vijayanagara kings and in the pațala
under reference, which is called the Rajadharmopadeśasvarūpaka-
thanam or'exposition of the duties of the king' it is but natural
that the sovereign should be advised to prevent by his authority
any tendency towards jātisaṁkara or mixture of castes by discri-
minating wisely between the higher and the lower castes and
punishing severely all those who try to go against this steel-frame
of Hinduism.
(3) Leaving aside the question as to how far the ancient domain
of Vijayanagara could be called a samrajya in the light of our
modern conception of an empire we have to point out that the pre-
sent treatise which deals specifically with sämrājyapīțhikā or the
Imperial tradition throughout uses the term sämrājya as will
be clear from the following expressions culled by me from the
several pafalas :-
1. Saletore : Social and Political life of Vijayanagar Empire,
Vol. II, ch. I, pp.1-23.

Similar expressions are used on pages 260, 261, 267, 270, 293, 297,
306,303, 327, 355,360, 402 and 435. In ch. 41 we find the follow-
ing verses mentioning the terms सम्राट, मण्डलेश्वर and ग्रामनायक.
p. 128--" कुर्यान्महोत्सवं सम्राट राजा वा मण्डलेश्वरः ।
तथा कतिपयग्रामनायको वापि मानवः। "
Other passages where the emperor and his tributary princes
are mentioned are the following:
P. 155-" सार्वभौमो नरपतिमण्डलस्थाधिपो दिवा (?)।
देशस्य नगरस्यापि नायको वा महीपतिः ॥"
p. 194-" सैन्यावलोकनमुखान् विनोदान्विवुधैस्सह ।
पश्यन्नृपतिसम्राटू राजा वा मण्डलेश्वरः ॥"
p. 199-" एवं प्रतिदिनं सायं नवरात्रे महोत्सवं ।
कृत्वा नरपतिस्सम्राट् राजा वा मण्डलेश्वरः॥"
It is clear from these usages of the terms साम्राज्यलक्ष्मी, सम्राट् ,
मण्डलेश्वर and ग्रामनायक that the idea of samrajya or empire was domi-
nant in the mind of the author of the treatise and it must have also
been current in his times.
(4) Prof. V. Ramanayya states' that Krsna Devaraya of Vijaya-
nagara was expert in playing the game of chess and that gambling
was a fashionable pastime in the aristocratic circles of the period.
He also states that there are constant allusions to the game of dice
by contemporary writers. We are also informed by him that the
wealthy people of the period sought diversion in playing chess and
the dice and that the game of dice was more popular than the game
of chess.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
In the Akāšabhairavakalpa we find in pațala 32 detailed instruc-
tions regarding the construction of the several inner apartments of
the royal palace. These apartments are as follows:- Fratte or the
bath-room ; qaarge or the kitchen-room ; artit or the bed-room;
कोषागार or the store room; शस्त्रशालाःor the armoury; मजनालय or the
swimming bath; farger or the study room ; HIATSU or the dining
room ; धनगेह or the treasury; रत्नमन्दिर or the room for keeping
jewellery; वस्त्रसदन or a room for storing clothes ; गन्धमन्दिर or a
room for keeping scents ; faartit or the temple, and the vaatet or
the room for playing at dice.
I am of opinion that the provision of a special room called the
Qantat provided for playing at dice leaves to doubt that the kings
of the period were fond of dice and consequently the writer of the
present manual intended for the use of Kings of the period, has
taken care to specify a gaataat in the list of the king's inner apart-
ments recorded by him.
(5) We are told by the writers of Indian history that the first
record of the use of the cannon and gun-powder in Indian warfare
is in the Memoirs of Baber.' In 1528 Baber forced the passage of
the Ganges near Kanauj with the aid of artillery. If this state-
ment is correct we must find a reference to guns in the Akāša.
bhairavakalpa which according to our interpretation is possibly
written by some one between 1500 and 1565. In fact we do find a
reference to gun in this treatise. In pațala 60 the king is advised to
worship thirty-two weapons in which No. 23 is nälikā, which I
interpret as a small gun. The verse containing reference to this
weapon reads as follows:--
.
p. 189—"alfast at Te faltaan agarathi
पञ्चविंशं तु टंकं स्यात् षड्विंश हलमीरितम् ॥"
In support of my interpretation I shall quote a passage from a
work composed in A. D. 1596 by Rudrakavi in which the word
nālikā definitely means a gun. This passage refers to red hot
iron balls issuing from the cannon's mouth and Rudrakavi des-
cribes this gun-fire by the:expression 'TicarraracaHaTTO:.'
This usage is, I believe, conclusive so far as the meaning of the
term nālika is concerned and is further supported by the use of

gun-powder indirectly referied to in the description of fire-works
given in the Akasabhairavakalpa. In patala 62 which deals with
several entertainments for the king we find a description of the
fire-works in the following passage :
p. 197-aa: TEET 5377fa start furgargata i
दिवाभ्रान्त्या कल्पयतः केनचित्तेजसानिशि ॥
उच्चावचान् बाणवृक्षान् ततः पश्यजनेश्वरः ।
स्फुलिंगान् चामराकारान् तिर्यगुद्विरतो बहून् ।
ततः प्रलयकालोद्यत् घनगर्जितभीषणम् ।
शणुयाद्वाणनिनदं विनोदावधिसूचकम् ॥
एवं प्रतिदिनं राजा विनोदान पञ्चविंशतिम् ॥"
In this passage the author gives us a description of the several
structures used in the pyrotechnic display that the king was to
witness every day. The expression arut AIIT possibly refers to
structures on which the bāņas or rockets were hung and from which
they were fired off in the air. Sparks of fire were emitted from
these structures and the whole display looked like the hairs of a
chowrie. Some of the sparks issuing from these structures were
shot off at a tangent. The entire display came to a close by the
sound of a rocket that was thrown last to indicate the closure of the
entertainment.
We know from the foreign travellers at the court of Vijaya-
nagara kings that fire-works were specially used by the Vijaya-
nagara kings during the celebrated Mahānavami festival. Abdur
Razzaq,' the Persian embassador, who witnessed the Mahānavami
celebrations observes: “Ohe cannot, without entering into a
a great detail, mention all the various kinds of pyrotechny and
squibbs and various other amusements which were exhibited."
Another foreign observer from Portugal who was present at the
Vijayanagara court describes the mahānavami festival and refers to
the fire-works used during this festival as follows:--"When these
amusements are ended they begin to throw up many rockets and
many different sorts of fires, also castles that burn and fling out
from themselves many bombs ( tiros ) and rockets."? I think the
castles mentioned by the Portuguese chronicler are identical with
the structures described by the expression दारुयन्त्रविशेषान् स्पन्दना-
1. Saletore, Op. cit., vol. II, pp. 373.74.
2. Ibid, p. 381.

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
setter and the rockets referred to by him are identical with the atop.
qu8 referred to by the Akasabhairavakalpa. As the use of gun-
powder was quite a novelty in India when it was first imported it
is possible to suppose that its use for purposes of fire-works on a
large scale became a special feature of royal entertainments as
evinced by the descriptions of fire-works given by foreign observers
and also recorded in the Akāśabhiaravakalpa as we have seen
above.
() Prof. Venkata Ramanayya' wbile dealing with the military
organization and the Kandācāra department of the Rāyas of Vijaya-
nagara observes that four kinds of forts are mentioned in the
Rāyavācaka which is an account of the reign of Krşnadevarāya in
Telugu prose. But a contemporary writer divides the forts
into eight classes. This contemporary writer is no other than Lolla
Lakşmidhara, a great scholar of the time of Krsnadevarāya. This
scholar in his Daivajñavilāsa (Rājacaritrakhanda )2 mentions the
eight classes of forts as follows :-
"प्रथमं गिरिदुर्ग च वनदुर्ग द्वितीयकम् ।
तृतीयं गह्वरं दुर्ग जलदुर्ग चतुर्थकम् ॥
पञ्चमं कदम दुर्ग षष्ठं स्यान्मिश्रकं तथा।
सप्तमं प्रामदुर्ग स्थात् कोष्टदुर्ग तथाष्टकम् ॥"
The Akāśabhairavakalpa has a regular chapter ( 21st patala)
which is called "अष्टगिरिदुगस्वरूपकथनम्" in which we find Lolla
Lakşmidhara's verses repeated almost verbatim with slight varia.
tion as follows:-
" प्रथमं गिरिदुर्ग स्याद्वनदुर्ग द्वितीयकम् ।
तृतीयं गहरान्तस्थं जलदुर्ग चतुर्थकम् ॥
पञ्चमं कर्दमाविष्टं स्यानाभिनामकम् ।
सप्तमं नरदुर्ग स्याकोष्ठदुर्ग तथाष्टमम् ॥"
It is difficult to say whether the Akāśabhairavakalpa is directly
indebted to Lolla Lakşmidhara for the above verses or not. Leave
ing aside the question of direct borrowing, we can at least state that
the eight-fold classification of forts was a patent idea with writers
on polity during the Vijayanagara period of history.

(7) We are told by historians that Krsnadevaraya of Vijaya-
nagara tried to get the monopoly of importing horses from
Persia and Arabia.' Let us now compare the following passage
from the Akāśabhairavakalpa in which Persian horses are stated to
be the best of all other breeds :--
patala 161, p. 428 :-
" उत्तमाः वाजिनः प्रोक्ताः पारसीकसमुद्भवाः।
उरोजाताश्च शीलाश्च हयाश्वारदेशजाः ।।

I am inclined to believe that the preference given to the Per-
sian horses in Krşnadevarāya's time has been recorded in the first
line of the above extract vis. " उत्तमा वाजिनः प्रोक्ताः पारसीकसमुद्भवाः"
found in the patala called "अश्वोत्पत्यादिस्वरूपनिरूपणम्."

has a chapter (78th patala) called the 'नानादानस्वरूपनिरूपणम्" in
which we find the following verscs mentioning yorgarcia as an
important one (महादान):-
Pages 264-5:-

(9) The Vijayanagara'empire was very much famous in the
days of its grandeur for the huge scale on which it celebrated its
round of Hindu festivals which attracted much attention from the
foreign observers. Accordingly we find in the A kāśabhairavakalpa
chapters devoted to the observance of these festivals such as the
Rāmanavami festival, the Navaratri festival, the Vijayādaśamī
festival, the Divāli festival, the Kämadeva festival etc. Chapter 79
of this treatise is actually designated as नानाविधीन्सवस्वरूपकथनं and
is concluded by the author as follows:

Space forbids us to record in this paper many other charac-
toristic features of the Akasabhairavakalpa which tend to support
my hypothesis that this treatise was composed by some learned
pandit or minister in close touch with the court of Vijayanagara
especially during its palmy days when the routine of social and
religious life of the Rāyas of Vijayanagara had become so stand-
ardized and popular as to warrant the composition of a regular trea-
tise some what on the analogy of the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya. I
am confident that protagonists of the Hindu culture of Vijaya-
nagara would find ways and means to publish this treatise, though
fragmentary, and keep it at the disposal of scholars for full
exploitation of its rich contents, which depict in a simple manner
the life as lived from day to day by those Rāyas of Vijayanagara
and their zealous subjects who kept alive for more than two cen-
turies the glory of Hindu religion and culture against the onslaught
of Islam.

18. Sābāji Pratāparāja, A Protégé of Burhān
Nizām Shah of Ahmadnagar, and His Works
- Between A. D. 1500 and 1560 *
In June 1941 my friend the late Dr. H. D. Sharma visited
Poona and during his stay of a month or so carried out a com-
plete analysis of a work on dharmaśāstra called the Paraśurāma-
pratāpa at my instance. The results of his elaborate analysis of
this compendium represented by some Mss at the B. O. R. Ins-
titute have been already published in the Poona Orientalist.'
Though Dr. Sharma saw through the proofs of this paper he has not
lived to see it in a published form ! I had promised Dr. Sharma a
paper on the author of this work but unfortunately I could not
draft it earlier owing to other preoccupations.
The author of the Paraśurāmapratāpa ( = P ) is Sābāji Pratāpa-
rāja ( = SP). Aufrecht makes the following entries regarding
this author and his works :-

makes the following remarks about this work :
" Parasurāmapratāpa is a huge work of an encyclopaedic nature.
No other library possesses a complete Ms of this work, except the
B. O. R. Institute, Poona, Library. But even the Institute Mss of
this work have a large number of folia missing. The work is on the
general topics of Dharmaśāstra and contains 16 Sections or Kāņļas.
It has been split up into 17 different codices in the Institute library.
Burnell's Catalogue of Tanjore library (p. 131a ) records only 5
Mes of 5 Sections. In the Baroda Oriental Institute there is
only one Ms (No. 5887) of one Section ( 276796HP108). The stu-
pendous nature of the work can be judged by the total number of
leaves which is 2445.”

M. M. Prof. P. V. Kane' makes the following remarks about
the works of SP :-
P. 755-" साम्बाजी or साबाजी प्रतापराज son of पण्डित पद्मनाभ of
जामदग्न्य वत्सगोत्र. He was a protégé of निजामसाह ; a. of
परशुरामप्रताप and भार्गवार्चनदीपिका (vide Ms No. 5887

पद्मनाभ of जामदग्न्यवत्सगोत्र and pupil of भट्ट कूर्म and a

least आह्निक, जातिविवेक, दान, प्रायश्चित्त, संस्कार, राजनीति and

P. 598 -“भार्गवार्चनदीपिका by साबाजी (or - म्बा) alias प्रतापराज

Aufrecht makes the following entries regarding भार्गवार्चन
दीपिका :-
CC I, 407-" भार्गवार्चनदीपिका quoted in द्रव्यशुद्धिदीपिका Oxf. 2748,
in निर्णयसिन्धु and शान्तसार."
As Kamalakara, the author of निर्णयसिन्धु (A. D. 1612) quotes
Sabaji's परशुरामप्रताप and भार्गवार्चनदीपिका we must infer that SP is
earlier than A. D. 1612. The Mss of दानकाण्ड and संस्कारकाण्ड of
P noted by Burnell (1318) belong to " about 1650." The author
of the द्रव्यशुद्धिदीपिका, which quotes SP's भार्गवार्चनदीपिका, was born in
A. D. 1668 according to Prof. P. V. Kane (HD, I, 566). The
शान्तिसार, which quotes भा. दीपका, is possibly of दिनकरभट्ट (HD, I,
636 ) who is assigned by Kane" between 1575-1640." All these
chronological references indicate that SP is definitely earlier than
A. D. 1600.
SP appears to have composed a poem called the "भृगुवंशमहा-

front", a Ms' of which is dated Samvat 1667 ( A. D. 1611). This
date is very important as it confirms the conclusion regarding
SP's date arrived at by me to the effect that SP is earlier than
A. D. 1600.
Let us now consider the evidence furnished by the works of
Sābājiabout his Muslim patron. This evidence is as follows :-
(1) Sābāji refers to fraganat as follows on folio 2 of
Ms No. 233 of Viš II –
“ 1997 PaTTACATtt 41 closit i ll 9801"
“ AFHAFTAJ169 i defe(n) à faa: 11 94 11"
" याहंमदेति परवासिभिरुद्धतासौ संकीर्तिता वरगुणैरभिनंथ काले ॥१८॥"
Both अहंमदपुर and निजामशाह नगरी refer to the same capital of
Sābāji's patron viz. Ahmadnagar, which was founded by Ahmad
Nizam Shah between A. D. 1490 and 1508.
(2) Sābāji refers to his relation to his patron fa la TIC as
follows :-( folio 29 of Ms No. 233 of Vif II)

TITTAJATdated Sarvat 1556 ( Vide p. 35 of his Report for 1904–
1906 ( Rajputana and Central India ) ] This date of Ms, if correct,
comes to A. D. 1500. I am unable to verify it as no details of it are
recorded in the Report. If the year belongs to the Saka era, the date
would be A. D. 1578, which would be in harmony with the evidence
regarding the chronology of Sābāji Pratāparāja recorded in this
paper. It is difficult to reconcile the date A. D. 1500 for a Ms of
TITATA19 with its date of composition which seems to lie between
C. A. D 1509 and 1553, the period of the reign of Burhan Nizam Shah
of Ahmadnagar.
2. One ATT spala TT is often mentioned in the Maratha
Chronicles. I am unable to penetrate the mist of gossip about this
personage, who is supposed by some writers to belong to Nizāmshāhi
and by others to belong to Adilshahi. Another writer says that he
flourished towards the close of the Peshwa Period ( Vide pp. 355-356
of Madhyayugina Caritra Kosa by Chitrav Shastri, Poona, 1937).
The question of the identity or otherwise of our साबाजी प्रतापराज with
Arata spata agt needs to be examined by students of the Maratha
history.

brated dharmaśāstra work Nrsimhaprasada was not only a high
army-officer in the employ of Ahmad Nizam Shah ( A.D. 1490-1510)
but was also his Keeper of Records. I have already identified
this author in the Burhan-i-Masir or the History of the Nizamshahi
Kings of Ahmadnagar, which Lt. Col. Haig regards as “ fairly trust-
worthy so far as it relates to domestic affairs. In this very
Burhan-i- Masir its author gives an account of the meeting between
Burhān Nizām Shāh of Ahmadnagar and Sultan Bahadur of Gujarat
as follows:
“Some historians have related that the meeting of these two
Kings ( Burhān Nizāmshāh ard Bahadur ) took place in a village
near Daulatabad and without the intervention of Shah Tahir but
by the advice and intervention of Khwaja Ibrahim, the Councillor
and Sabāji and that these two men were rewarded for the service
which they had performed, the former with the title of Latif-Khan
and the latter with that of Pratap Rāi ; but the story told here
at length is the correct account. After this meeting Burhan Nizam
Shah returned to his capital and Sultan Bahadur returned to
Gujarat.”
The author or the Burhan-i-Masir wants to take away the
credit of bringing about the meeting of the two Kings from Sābāji
Pratap Rāi and his colleague Khwaja Ibrahim Latif Khan and to
give it to Shah Tahir, the great poet of this period. We are not
concerned here with the truth or otherwise of this statement of the
author but with the fact of the existence of a Hindu personage of
the name Sābāji Pratap Rāi during the reign of Burhān Nizam
Shah ( A. D. 1510-1554) I am inclined to believe that this Sabāji
Pratap Rãi is none else than our rast garggr, the author of
TTTTTAJATT, TTATA rot and Arriaranetar. Evidently he car-
ried on the tradition of compiling dharmaśāstra works in the
manner of the author of the नृसिंहप्रसाद viz. दलपतिराय highly favoured
by Ahmad Nizam Shaha ( A. 1490-1510 ) who was the founder of the

Mr. Bendre examines the relevant sources and concludes “ All we
can say for the present with any certainty on the strength of the
contemporary evidence of such a realiable source as Affonso de
Albuquerque, is that the death of Ahmad Nizam Shah must have
occurred some time between the end of April and the middle of Octo-
ber 1510 or in the beginning of 916 A. H.".

Ahmadnagar line of Nizamishahi Kings. If this position is accept-
ed we may try to determine the approximate period during which
Sabaji composed his परशुरामप्रताप and भृगुवंशमहाकाव्य etc.
Sabaji tells us that he was निजामशाह.अनचर or a servant of निजाम-
TIE, whom we have identified with Burhan Nizam Shah. He also
refers to his title Tar7757 constantly in his works as follows :-
(1) Colophon of a $154 -
"Etat ofsagartigfarfaà paa etc."
(2) Text of grguraqan -" tyra: gait:" ( = gargara);
-"TTA TAIP: sagorifga: ”
- " #: atlea: gargaggia: etc.”
- "spiciatferdaganga: storiana: "
(3) Colophon of परशुरामप्रताप -
“Amartgarattstrerafaat"
(B. O. R. I. Ms No. 157 of Viš 1, dated A. D. 1784 )
If tart777 was a title of Sābāji it must have been conferred on
him by his royal patron Burhān Nizam Shah and the story about the
award of this title referred to in the Burhān-i-Masir may be taken
to be correct in so far as the fact of the award of this title is con-
cerned. We are not concerned here with the nature of the service
specifically rendered by Sābāji to his master Burhān Nizam Shah. If
we believe in the story current before the time of Burhän-i-Masir
that Sābāji got the title qarqira as a reward for bringing about the
meeting of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat with Burhān Nizam Shah it is
easy for us to narrow down the limits for the dates of the परशुराम.
प्रताप and भृगुवंशकाव्य for the following reasons :--
(1) Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat ruled for 11 years (July
1526 - February 1537 A. D.). In 1527-29 A. D. he forced Burhān
Nizam Shah to retreat and acknowledge him as his Suzerain and
read Khutbah in his name.'
(2) In 1531 A. D. Bahadur Shah granted to Burhan Nizam of
Ahmadnagar and also to his nephew, Muhammad of Khāndesh per.
mission to affix the title of Shah ( TIE ) to their names.?

(3) If the title ganger was a result of the meeting of Sultan
Bahadur Shah of Gujarat with Burhān Nizam it must have been con-
ferred on erarofi between A. D. 1526 and 1537 A. D., which is the
period of Bahadur Shāh's reign.
(4) If the expression PTTH. Tre used by aarst contains the
title Tre the use of which was permitted for Burhãn Nizam by his
Suzerain in A. D. 1531 we have to suppose that Arats composed
his works after A. D. 1531 and before A. D. 1553.54, the closing
year of Burhān Nizam Shah's reign at Ahmednagar.
I have identified aratat SATTTIS with his name-sake mentioned
in the Burhan- j. Masir. This work was written by Syed Ali Tabā-
tabā at the bidding of Burhān Nizam Shah II in A. D. 1591 i. e. a
few years before Ferishtā. According to Prof. H. K. Sherwani
"greater reliance may be placed on the simple narration of the
Burhān than on the flowery and interesting, though at times in-
accurate and exaggerated, description couched in Ferishta's His-
tory." In view of this evaluation of the Burhan-i-Masir my identi-
fication of Alari TaTTer in this Persian source of the Nizām Shāhī
history written in A. D, 1591 is sufficiently reliable and possesses
almost a contemporary character. I shall, however, feel thankful
to Persian scholars if they succeed in throwing more light on the
personality of Ararat Tarih and his relations with his master
Burhān Nizam Shah, so much applauded in the verses of the Para.
śurāmapratapa quoted by Dr. Sharma in extenso. The genealogy

political or dynastic history, if successfully attempted, is:bound to
clarify our knowledge of the history of our ancestors, who were
not merely soldiers or politicians but were persons full of reli-
gious zeal coupled with a taste for fine arts, like poetry, music and
technical sciences like Silpa Šāstra, town planning, dietetics, medi-
cine, cookery etc. By a thorough study of the sources, bearing on
these subjects the present partial picture of our history can be put
in correct historical relief, which will not fail to create greater
interest of the people in our past than what we notice to-day in our

no MS of Bhagavaddisa'si'commentary is found in this catalogue.
The spread of Jayadeva's Gitagovinda to the Deccan is attested by
its influence on Bhāskara-Bhat Borikar, a Mahanubhāva author who
flourished between 1275 and 1320 A. D. Prof. V. B. Kolte' of
Amraori has already pointed out parallel passages from the Gita.
govinda and Bhaskarabhatta's Sisupalavadha composed about Saka
7230 ( A. D. 1308 ). The spread of the Gitagovinda in Gujarat has
recently been pointed out by Dr. M. R. Majmudar of Baroda.
This influence is vouched by the stone inscription of Sarngadeva
dated Samyat 1348 ( A. D. 1291 ) in which the invocation verse is
taken from the last verse of the 1st canto of the Gitagovinda.

If the above extract found in a MS of A. D. 1628 is a genuine
part of the Ras akadambakallolini of Bhagavaddāsa we may safely
infer that this commentary was composed between A. D. 1469 and
A. D. 1628.
In the list of references recorded above there is a reference to
a work called Tar argy? ( vide folio 123 of MS No. 345 of 1884-87
and folio 18 of MS No. 77 of A 1879-80). This work appears to
be identical with the Hina Tataras composed by Sanātana
Gosvami in A. D. 1542. If this identification is correct the date
of Bhagavad dāsa is narrowed down between A. D. 1542 and
1628. These limits may be further narrowed down between say
A. D. 1575 and 1620 or so if we can identify the HarTarATT men-
tioned by our commentator with Bhattoji Dīkşita, the author of
JTEHITATS a commentary on the Prakriyāprakāśa of his guru Sesa-
1. Perhaps the correct reading ought to have been "5475 Tua
(SHBUTAT )” as Rāṇā Kumbhakarņa wrote a commentary on the
Gitagovinda. Vide p. 75 of H. Poleman's Indic MSS in USA.,
where MS No. 1152 of this comm. called that dated A. D. 1563
( Sam., 1619 ) is recorded. Another reference to Kumbhakarņa is
found on folio 3a of MS No. 77 A 1879-80.-
" sabari ZETTAT Fira fa Tre affeafafet gauft: ” (Vide
folio 7 of MS No. 45 of 1871-72).
2. Vide Aufrecht, CC, I.
3. Ibid., CC, I.
4. Vide my paper on " A new Approach to the Date of Bhattoji
Dikşita " in Annals ( Tirupati), Vol. I, part 2, pp. 117-127, where I
have tried to prove that Bhattoji flourished between c. 1560 and
1620 A. D.
5. This is a commentary on the Prakriyaprakaśa of Seşa Krşņa
inguru of Bhagtoji. Jagannātha Paņạitarāja did not like Bhattoji's
criticism of his guru's work in the HATTAT and hence he wrote a
refutation of मनोरमा in a work called मनोरमाकुचमार्दनी.

krşņa. If Bhagavaddāsa's reference to part art in a MS of A. D.
1628 turns out to be a genuine reference to Bhattoji Dikşita, the
author of Thai1#1, it supports my limits for Bhattoji's date viz.
A. D. 1560-1620. In my paper on Bhottoji's date referred to above
I have noted that A. D. 1633 is the earliest date of a MS of
Bhattoji's Šabdakaustubha ( R. A. S. :Bengal). Since this paper
was published I have traced afMS':of an'abridgement of Bhațţtoji's
Siddhantakaumudi dated:A.:D.:1624.: Now we find hättar TT ( =
Bhaſtoji) referred to in a MS of A. D. 1628. The cumulative effect
of all these dates viz. A. D. 1624, 1628, and 1633 strengthens my in-
ference that Bhattoji's literary career ended by A. D. 1620.
Leaving aside the reference to a TA1917 made by Bhagvad-
dāsa in his Rasakadambakallolini let us examine some other refer-
ences which may enable us to fix the earlier limit to his date. Our
commentator mentions several times a work on alamkāra called the
Rasārņavasudhākara ( vide No. 20 in the list of references given
above). This work was composed about A. D. 1330 or A. D.
1350 according to scholarsa by Singabhūpāla. This reference ena-
bles us to fix about A. D. 1400 as one sure limit to the date of the
Rasakadambakallolini. This limit is further strengthened by ano-
ther reference made by this commentary to a work on erotics called
according to scholas composed about 18% of references aithe
1. Vide H. Poleman: Indic MSS in U.S. A., (1938), p. 130 –
MS No. 2635 of Laghusiddhantakaumudi by Varadarāja, a pupil of
Bhattoji Dikşita, dated Samvat 1680 = A. D. 1624. We must neces-
sarily presume some intervals of time between
(1) the composition of Siddhantakaumudi by Bhattoji.
(2) its abridgement by Varadaraja in the form of the
Laghuº Kaumudi, Ery
and (3) the copying of this abridgement in A. D. 1624. I may
also note here the references to मनोरमाकार :-
(1) A. D. 1628 - MS of रसकदम्बकल्लोलिनी refers to मनोरमाकार,
(2) Bhatļoji's son Hractia refers to HITAT on p. 14 of
his commentary on 3HTETET ( N. S. Press, 1905 )
"कारग्रहणान इति मनोरमायाम् उणादौ दीक्षिताः"
(3) A. D. 1652 - B. O. R. 1. MS of AT&HATAT (No. 331 of
1895-1902 ).
2. Vide pp. 242-43 of History of Sanskrit Poetics Vol. I, ( 1923 5
by Dr. S. K. De. Prof. P. V. Kane assigns it to about A. D. 1350

the Pancasayaka' which was composed by Jyotirióvara about A. D.
1324 and which is referred to by our author several times ( vide
No. 17 in the list of references). Other references to earlier works
like the intatart of the 13th century need not be considered as
they don't help us to improve our chronology of this author. It
would thus be seen that the date of Bhagavaddāsa surely lies bet-
ween A D. 1400 and 1600 and if the references to the रसामृतसिन्धु
and the मनोरमा turn out to be genuine references to the भगवद्भक्तिरसा.
मृतसिन्धु composed in A. D. 1542 and to the प्रौढमनोरमा composed be-
fore A. D. 1600 or so by Bhattoji Diksita we shall be in a position
to infer that Bhagavad dāsa composed the Rasakadambakallolini say
between A. D. 1600 and 1628, the date of the B. O. R. I. MS of
this commentary.
As regards the personal details of our commentator no infor-
mation except the name of the author and the title of the commen-
tary has been recorded by him as will be seen from the following
extract at the end of the commentary :-

According to Farquhar' the Tantrasāra of Krşņānanda Vāgisa
dates from A. D. 1812. In the Catalogue of MSS in the Vargiya
Sāhitya Parişat we find two MSS of the T'antrasāra of Krşņānanda
Bhațțācārya, which are dated A. D. 1693 and 1770. If the work
called the Tantrasāra mentioned by Farquhar is identical with its
name-sake represented by two dated MSS referred to above we
must reject the date A.D. 1812 for it given by Farquhar. In fact this
contradiction of dates for the Tantrasāra led me to the search of a
MS of the work which is dated 54 years earlier than the MS of
A. D. 1693 mentioned above. This MS' is identical with MS No.

On folio 29 we find an author of the name graag! who is, in
my opinion, identical with TCHE the author of a commentary on
the Săradātilaka. This commentary was composed in A. D. 1494.
Subsequent references to ITEM ( vide reference No. 32 in the
above list ) are made briefly as “ Te:.” If this identification
is accepted we may fix the date of the Tantrasära of Kroņānanda
Vāgiša Bhattācārya between A. D. 1494 and A. D. 1639, the date
of the B. O. R. I. MS of the Tantrasära analysed above.
According to Dr. Binoytosh Bhattacharya? Kțsņānanda, the

( vide p. 95b of Aufrecht's Cata. of Oxford MSS, 1864 ).
2. Vide p. 80 of Bulletin of Rama Varma Research Institute,
Vol. X, Part II ( July, 1942) - "Krşņānanda, the author of Tantra-
sära was a disciple of Pūrpānanda, who in his turo was a disciple of
Brahmananda. Pūrņānanda wrote a work Tattvacintamani, which
was composed in the Śaka year 1499, which corresponds to A. D.
1577. Krşņānanda, who is one generation later, can be confidently
placed in about A. D. 1607." - Dr. Bhattacharya notes the following
works mentioned in the Tantrasāra :-
आगमसार, भैरवीतन्त्र, एकवीराकल्प, गोबिन्दवृन्दावन, हंसमाहेश्वर, अगस्त्यसंहिता,

author of the Tantrasära," can be canfidently ptaced in about A. D.
1607” because his guru Purnānanda composed his Tattvacintamani
in Säka 1499 = A. D. 1577. Dr. Bhattachary's date for Krşņānanda,
viz., "about A. D. 1607" is in harmony with the limits for the date
of this author fixed by me ( Between A. D. 1494 and 1639). It, how-
ever, conflicts with the date of a MS of the Tantrasära recorded by
Poleman.' This MS is dated Sarnoat 1586 = A. D. 1530. Pre-
suming that this date is correct we have to fix the limits
for the date of the Tantrasära between A. D. 1494 and
1530. These limits harmonize with the dates of argenerHTH
as given in the Madhyayugina Caritrakośa,' where we are told
that our Krsnānanda was the pupil of argentata (c. A.
D. 1550—1525). Dr. S. K. Des in his recent book on Vais-
nava Faith and Movement in Bengal states : "Krşņānanda Agama-
vāgića, the author of Tantrasāra and the great exponent of
Tāntric doctrines in Bengal, is said to have been (like
Raghunandana) a contemporary of Caitanya ; and there can be
hardly any doubt as to the widespread character of Tântric teach-
ing in Bengal." Later in the same book Dr. De refers to the
tradition according to which Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma had 4 pupils :

atau, "Dr. De thinks that Caitanya's pupilship, even though plausi-
ble, appears to have no foundation in fact and that “Targa and
certare belonged to much later times."'!
According to Dr. J. B. Chaudhuria Raghubandana " was a con.
temporary of Sri. Caitanya and flourished towards the close of the
filteenth century. The period of his literary activity probably
lay between 1520 and 1570." According to Dr. S. K. De Caitanya
was born in February, 1486 and passed away in June-July, 1533.5
Prof. Sri Ram Sharma includes Raghunandanas in his list of
Sanskrit writers of the reign of Emperor Akbar (A. D. 1542-1005).
The chronological data recorded in the foregoing discussion
may now be tabulated as follows:
A. D.
Remarks ; K= Kșşņānanda, author of Tantrasära
1486 Birth of Caitanya, who is supposed to be a contem.
porary of K and Raghunandana.
C. 1450 - Dates of Vāsudeva Sārvabhauma, supposed to be the
1525 guru of K.
1494
Date of perfodiair by Rāghavabhatta, who is
mentioned by K in his Tantrasära as pointed out
by me.

2. Vide p. 132 of Appendix to the Edition of Gangāväkyävali,
Calcutta, 1940. — There is some contradiction in the extract, quoted
above. “ Close of the fifteenth century” would necessarily be before
A.D. 1500 while Dr. Chaudhuri gives“ between 1520 and 1570" as the
period of Raghunandana's literary activity. This period falls in the
16th century.

man is correct it will clinch down the date of the Tantrasära bet-

reconciled with his date for Krşņānanda, viz., "about A. D. 1607."

पिश(प) कपिलाकारो नीलो दूर्वादलप्रभः ।
कृष्णो जम्बूफलाकारस शास्त्रज्ञैः समुदाहृतः ॥ ४१ ॥
इति अश्ववर्णाः "
The above quotation raises the question of Bhoja's ir debied-
ness to नकुल, whose अश्वधिकिस्सित was published long ago in the Bib.
liotheca Indica ( Calcutta, 1887). It will be clear from the follow-
ing evidence that the अश्वयुक्ति of Bhoja's युक्तिकल्पतरु is indebted to
the भवचिकिस्सित of नकुल:-
(1) The quotation from the introduced with the words
"पदाह नकुलः" reproduced above is taken from Chapter 3 of नकुल-
भश्वचिकिस्सित ( pp. 7 8 of Bib. Indica, Edition, 1887) where it read
an follows:-
"भथ तृतीयोऽध्यायः। वर्णवर्णनम् ।
वर्णाः सप्त भवन्तीह सर्वेषां वाजिनां ध्रुवम् ।
तानह कीर्तयिष्यामि भेदाताममेकधा ॥१॥
सिती रतस्तथा पीता सारतः पिक एव च।
मीकः कृष्णोऽथ सबैषां वेता श्रेष्ठतमः स्मृतः ॥२॥
श्वेतः पालेयसकाशो रक्त कमकुमसनिमः।
हरिद्रासरश: पीता सारतः कषुरः स्मृतः ॥३॥
पिङ्गः कपिलकाकारो नीलो दूर्वाप्रसंनिभः।।
कृष्णो जम्बूफलाकारः शास्त्रज्ञैः समुदाहृतः ॥ ४॥"
In spite of a few variants this passage is almost identical with
the passage quoted by Bhoja with the words "यदाह नकुलः".
(2) To corroborate the above identification I record below
additional comparison of verses and groups of verses common to
भोज and नकुल :-
Bhojal = B) p. 181-
" सपक्षा वाजिनः पूर्व संजाता ब्योमचारिणः ।

The foregoing comparison of extracts from the purret section
of Bhoja's युक्तिकल्पतरु and from the अश्वचिकित्सित of Nakula clearly
shows how Bhoja, who definitely mentions as by name and
quotes from his parentera has borrowed freely from Nakula's
work. If the अश्वयुक्ति section in the युक्तिकरुपतरु is a genuine work

of king Bhoja we have to conclude that the surfafiga of Footer is
earlier than Bhoja ( C. A. D. 1050). We are thus in a position to
determine the later limit for Nakula's work viz. c. A.D. 1000.
As regards the earlier limit to Nakula's starfarna I have to
make the following observations:
(1) The passage mentioning the Arabian ( arriten ) and Khura-
san (UTTIM) hörses as the best horses is common to both Bhoja and
Nakula as we have seen above. The expression " aircrat: TTTT:”
in Bhoja's अश्वयुक्ति is a misreading for " ताजिकाः खुरशाणा:" used by
Nakula.
(2) Khurason' is a Province of North East Persia .bounded
on the North by the U. S. S. R., on the West by Mazandaran and
Iraq Ajemi, on the South by Kuhistān, and on the East by Afghani-
stan. It consists partly of desert and partly of high-lying land,
portions of which are fertile. Evidently the OTTO horses are
equivalent to पारसीक horses, mentioned by जयदत्त in his अश्वबंधक,
by the अमरकोश, by हेमचन्द्र in his अभिधानचिन्तामणि (c. A. D. 1140),
by AIÀT in his ArgIA ( C. A. D. 1130 ) and even by any in his
poarta ( C. A. D. 630 ).?
(3) I have presumed that the arga horses mentioned by
apps and 37157 are equivalent to Arabian horses on the assurance
of some friends. The Marathi Dictionary called the Sabdakośa
mentions arofi = Arabi horse ( Arabic-argi). Whether the term
alistus is identical with arsit cannot be said with certainty as in the
Ain-i-Akbari ( p. 156 of Gladwin's Trans. 1897 ) seven kinds of
horses are mentioned, in which the Arab horse is distinguished
from the Tazee, which is given as the name of the best horse
1. Vide p. 615 of World Pictorial Gazetteer by J. A. Hammerton.
2. I propose to write a paper on Persian Horses in Sanskrit
literature in which I shall record detailed evidence about Persian
horses mentioned in Sanskrit texts and its bearing on the history of
the import of Persian and Arabian horses in large numbers referred
to in the Bambay Gazetteer (Thana ) 1882 as follows:-( Page 431 )
(810 — 1260 A. D.) Trade Centres — "The chief trade in Animals
was towards the close of the period ( 1290 ), a great import of horses
from the Persian Gulf and from Arabia. No ships came to Thana
without horses...... This great demand for horses seems to have risen
from the scare among the Hindu rulers of the Deccan caused by the
Mussalman cavalry. As many as 10,000 horses a year are said to
have been imported." (Yule's Morco Polo, II, 330.)

"mostly bred in Hindustan.” To make confusion worse con-
founded we have Tajik as the name of a republic of Russia formed
in 1924 out of the former regions of Bukhara and Turkistan and
further APT in his Hagia ( A. D. 1130 ) mentions att horses
among the best breeds of horses. It remains to be seen whether
the terms arrgia, at aft, Tazee, Tajik are identical or otherwise. I
intend to examine these terms in a separate paper with a view to
clarifying the above confusion and hence cannot deal with them in
this paper without detailed evidence.
For the present we may conclude that Nakula's Ašvacikitsita
is earlier than c. A.D. 1000 as king Bhoja has borrowed from it
largely in the Asvayukti section of his Yuktikalpataru, mentioning
in one place the name of Nakula along with the extract borrowed.

22. Date of Śrīdharasvāmin, Author of the
Commentaries on the Bhāgavata Purāņa and
Other Works — Between c. A.D. 1350 and 1450 *
During the course of my studies in Indian literary history my
attention was directed to the date of Sridharasvāmin, the author
of the popular Sanskrit commentary on the Bhagavatapurana and
other works. In this connection I consulted a Marathi book called
the Bhagavatādarsa by Mr. Kolbatkar, who states on p. 494 of his
book that the date of Sridharasvāmi is not certain. In view of this
statement I began to collect some data on the problem of Sri-
dharasvāmi's date for the purpose of clarifying the present doubts
and uncertainties about this date. The notes gathered by me so
far are recorded in this paper with my tentative conclusion about
this date within the limits of the data discovered by me.
(1) J. N. Farquhar in his Outline of Religious Literature of
India ( Oxford, 1920 ) refers to Sridhara's date as follows:
Page 231 — " Sridhara Svāmi, the author of the most famous
commentary on it (Bhagavata), who probably
lived about A. D. 1400.”
Page 239 – Bhagavatabhäşya of Vişnusvāmi is referred to by
Sridharasvāmio in his comment on Bhagavata
P.-1.7.
Page 269 - Devi Bhagavata is prior to “ Sridhara who lioed
about A. D. 1400."
Page 297 - Probably about A. D. 1400, Sridharasvāmi, Mabant
of the Samkarite monastery, Govardbana in Puri,
wrote a commentary on the Bhagavata P. He
begins his commentary with the distinct state-
ment that the great Purana was not written by
VOPADEVA ... Sridhara wrote at a time consider.
ably later than A. D. 1300, when Vopadeva
flourished. Sridhara's commentary was well-
known by the end of the 15th century.

Citsukha as stated in the above entries he must be later than Cit-
sukha.' Sridhara must be earlier than Rūpagosvāmin, who quotes
some verses of Sridhara in his Padyāvali. · Citsukha is said to have
flourished between A. D. 1220 and 1284. If this date for Citsukha
is correct we are warranted in fixing c. A. D. 1200 as the earlier
terminus to the date of Sridhara. In this connection Dr. S. K. Des
observes :-"As Sridhara refers to Vopadeva, he could not have
been earlier than 1300 A. D." This view of Dr. De is in harmony
with the statement of Amarnath Raya who states in one of his
articles that Sridhara is a " late 14th or early 15th century teacher ? "
(4) The later limit to the date of Sridhara can be fixed defi-
nitely on the strength of some dated MSS of Sridhara's works
noted below :
(i) The Catalogue of Anup Sanskrit Library, (Bikaner, 1944 )
records the following MSS of Sridhara's commentaries dated
A. D. 1516 and 1582 :-

1. Vaṁsidhara, author of Bhāvārthadipikā ( Venkateśvara Press.
informs us that the commentary on the Bhagavata by Sridhara was
preceded by that of Citsukha ( Vide Poona Orientalist, Vol. I, No. 2, p.
65 - Review of Srutikalpalată by Dr. H. Sharma ). If Vamsidhara's
statement is correct it supports Aufrecht's entry about the posteriority
of Sridhara to Citsukha. According to Vamsidhara two other commen.
taries on the Bhagavata by Samkara and Hanūmat respectively prece-
ded Sridhara's commentary.

following extract:-
Preface p, li — " Hina aft, p. 28 No. 934 ; and p. 91, No. 14

character by Raghupati at the village Poari in La. San. 393(= A.D.

It is clear from the above evidence that there are MSS of Sri-
dhara's commcntaries dated A.D. 1511, 1516, 1582 and 1590. This
evidence cnables us to fix A. D. 1500 as the later limit to Sridha.
ra's date. This limit can be pushed back still further on the basis
of further evidence to follow.
(5) Vişgupuri of Tirhut was one of the carly inspirers of the
Bhakti movement in Bengal. He followed the tradition of Sri.
dhara which he directly acknowledges in the closing verse of his
work called #7770- Teattest.' This verse reads as follows:-
“7 ETCanalformat reasona
तरक्षन्तुं सुधियोऽईत स्वरचनालुब्धस्य मे चापलम् ॥"
Caitanya himself possessed the highest veneration for Sridhara and
on one occasion he is said to have repudiated a commentary on the
Glad on the ground that it departed from Sridhara's interpretation.'
Kavi Karpapūra, who flourished much earlier than the period of
Caitanya mentions Vişnupuri as a predecessor according to Dr.
S. K. De. We thus get the following series of authors from
Sridhara onwards :-

(11) Another MS of the Bhagavata with Sridhara's com-
mentary ( No. 435 F of Vis I in the Govt. MSS Library at the

date is in harmony with the dates A. D. 1511 ( Nepal MS ) and 1516
( Bikaner MS ) already recorded by me while dealing with the
dated MSS of Sridhara's commentary on the Bhagavata copied in
the 16th century.
(12) Dr. P. V. Kane' refers to one " StarTICITAT mentioned
by रघुनन्दन in एकादशीतव (Vol. II. p. 25), in मलमासतरव (Vol. I,
p. 820, as the author of a hourer"). According to Dr. Kane
Raghunandana, the author of greatrara flourished between A. D.
1490 and 1570 ( see p. 419 of Vol. I of History of Dharmusastra,
1930). If this Sridharasvāmin is identical with his name-sake, the
commentator of the Bhagavata etc. we get A. D. 1490 as the later
terminus to the date of Sridharasvāmin, which harmoniscs with his
priority to Caitanya ( born A. D. 1485 ) as noted by me already in
this paper.

" रागाविष्टे विक्रमादित्यशाक।
माघे श्लिष्टे सोमवारेण दर्श।
सिद्धे योगे विष्णुनक्षत्रकृष्टे।
सिक्षेत्रे मावास्या विशिष्ट ।।"
The chronogram in this verse needs to be interpreted. Pandit
Visvanātha Sastri of the Mahābhārata Department of the B. O. R.
Institute interprets "Trofal as meaning the year “ 1432"
according to the “mbratit” system of calculation. The con-
sonants in the expression " mifae" are shown below with their
numerical values :
8( = 2) 01 = 3) #1 = 4) :( = 1)
Reversing the numbers 2, 3, 4, 1 we get 1432 as the year indicated
by the expression “ Triat." If this calculation is correct the
date of the MS would be Vikramaditya Saka 1432 = A. D. 1376.
I hope that experts in Indian chronology would verily this calcula.
tion in the light of other details mentioned in the last three lines
of the stanza and see if it is correct.
On the strength of the data recorded above I am inclined to
fix up the date of Sridharasvãmin between C. A. D. 1350 and 1450.

23. The History and Chronology of a
Nāgara Brahmin Family of Physicians in
Gujarāt – A. D. 1275-1475 *
In a recent issue' of the Journal of the Gujarat Research Society,
Durga Shankar K. Shastri has published an interesting article on
‘Medical Science in Ancient Gujarat.' In this article he makes the
following remarks on Nārāyaṇa, who completed the commentary,
vyakhya-Kusumavall of Srikanthadatta on the Vrnda-mädhaug or
Siddha-yoga of Vroda :-
"Narayana ( 15th century) - The manuscript evidence of the
Kusumavali, a gloss by Srikantha on the Vrnda-mådhava indicates
that a Vaidya named Närāyaṇa, the son of Bhimalla and a någig by
caste is said to have completed the above (gloss, which was left
unfinished by its author through fear of its becoming too bulky.'
Nothing certain is known about his date and domicile. He is
obviously later than Srikantha, who lived in Bengal in the 13th cen-
tury. He is, moreover, earlier than the 17th century for a MS of
the completed Kusumävalt written in 1630 A. D. is available. It is
highly probable that it took a long time for Srikantha's commen.
tary to reach Gujarāt and on the other hand, it might have been not
too long an interval to blend the two works. It is, therefore, likely
that Nārāyaṇa lived in the 15th century. As remarked above
Vägbhata's commentary written in Bengal in the 13th century was
studied in Gujarat in the 15th. Similarly, the comments on the

NÅGARA BRAHMIN FAMILY OF PHYBICIANS IN QUJARAT

Vynda-madhava were perhaps studied in the same period and some
one tried to fill in the lacuna. Nārāyaṇa is associated with Gujarāt
merely because he was a Nägir. From amongst the numerous
commentaries on the Sanskrit works on ancient medicine, not one
can be credited to Gujarāt. Hence the importance of Nārāyaṇa.”
These remarks of D. K. Shastri are quite reasonable in the
light of evidence adduced by him. I propose, however, to record
in this paper some reliable evidence which throws a flood of light
on the family of Nārāyana Bhișaj and its history for about 200 years,
say between A.D. 1300 and 1500. This evidence will also, clarify the
date of Nārāyaṇa who is assigned by Mr. Shastri to 15th century.
It will also be seen from my evidence that the interest of the
several members of this family of Năgar Brahmins in the theory
and practice of medicine remained unbroken for about two cen-
turies.
Aufrecht records (CC I, p. 289 ) the following works of Nārā.
yana Bhisaj':-( 1 ) gela khu 88, (2) Casian Gia K 218,
(3) guard B. 4. 242 and ( 4 ) aerga B. 4 214. The MSS of these
works on medicine are not available to me for examination.
I am, therefore, unable to say if Nārāyana Bhişaj, who completed
GOTO-qaradt of Srikanthadatta, is identical with his namesake,
the author of these works. The catalogues, in which these Sans-
krit works are mentioned, do not describe the MSS recorded and
consequently it is difficult to say if these works were composed
by the Nāgara Brahmin Nārāyana Bhișaj who completed Srikantha-
datta's commentary on the Vịndamadhava or Siddh-ayoga. The
only MS of व्याख्या-कुसुमावली recorded by Aufrecht (CC I, p 618)
is No. 375 of 1882-83 in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R.
Institute, Poona. This work has been published.?
In his History of Ayurveda (antra mat facte), written in
Gujarātī ( Gujarāt Vernacular Society, Ahmedabad, 1942, p. 180).
D. K. Shastri makes the following remarks about TOT 7991 :-
1. This 7TTO TITT should not be confounded with FT TOT, who
composed a commentary on त्रिशती of शाङ्गधर called सिद्धान्त-सञ्चय. This
author was the son of FSOTHE and younger brother of amater (See MSS
Nos. 622 of 1895–1902 and 947 of 1884-87 in the Govt. MSS Library

D. K. Shastri has not seen my paper or this Gujarāti rendering. In
my paper under reference I have recorded the following facts :-
(1) अनन्त composed his कामसमूह in A. D. 1457.
(2) He belonged to भाभल्लवंश and was the son of मन्त्रिमण्डन,
as stated by him in the following verse :
"भाभल्लवंशजातेन मन्त्रिमण्डनसूनुना।
भनन्तेन महाकाव्यप्रवन्धः क्रियते मया ॥६॥"
(3) His father मण्डन was the son of नारायण, as stated by अनन्त
in the following verses :-
" विद्वजनसभानन्दो मन्त्री नारायणास्मजः।
मण्डनस्तस्य पुत्रेण वर्ण्यन्ते स्मर्तवोऽधुना ॥ ६९ ॥
नारायणास्मजः श्रीमान् मन्त्री श्रीमण्डनो द्विजः।
तासुतेन प्रियावस्था प्रयाणे वनिता मुदा॥"
(4) अनन्त belonged to नागर ज्ञाति, as stated by him in the fol-
lowing verse:-
" नागरज्ञातिजातेन मन्त्रिमण्डनसूनुना।
अनन्तेन महाकाव्या (? व्यं) सतीवृत्तं प्रकाशितम् ॥"
(5) अनन्त states that he was a resident of a town (नगर) found-
ed by भहिम्मद :-
"महिम्मदनिर्मितनगरे विहितावसतिश्च वृद्धनागरिकः।
मण्डनसनुरनन्तो रचयति सेवाविधिनार्याः॥"
भहिम्मदनगर' mentioned in the above verse cannot be Ahmadnagar
founded by Ahmad Nizam Shah in A. D. 1494), It may be identi. .

cal with Ahmedabad ( founded in A. D. 1513 ) or Ahmadnagar ( now
Himmatnagar, the capital of Idar State ( founded in A. D. 1427 ).
Both these towns were founded by Amad I of Gujarat before A. D.
1457, the date of the कामसमूह of अनन्त.
(6) One 319-etui was the Guru of -a, as stated in the
following verse :-
" आनन्दपूर्णगुरुपादयुगं प्रणम्य ।
891771 fagna grat tegara: 11 poll"
One आनन्दपूर्ण alias विद्यासागर, the commentator of the महा-
Hita, was a contemporary of Kāmadeva, the Kadamba ruler of Goa,
one of whose inscriptions is dated A. D. 1393.
(7) para describes his father fica as Afana'minister', and,
also, as भूपतीनां भिपग्वरः 'physician to kings' and गजायुर्वेदवेता
goa-arrearat:' proficient in the veterinary science dealing with
elephants as yra art himself.'
(8) अनन्त calls himself a वृद्ध नागरिक of अहिम्मदनगर. He also
calls himself 3779715: proficient in many sciences.' He also
styles himself as f iquiac. expert in medical science '( like his
father High expert in veterinary and general medicine ).
The identity of Nārāyaṇa Bhişaj ( who completed the 59184T-
कुसुमावली of श्रीकण्ठदत्त ) with नारायण the grandfather of अनन्त of A. D.
1457 will be clear from the following tabulated statement :
-
नारायण भिषज्
PITTUT, grandfather of ara
-
(1) He calls himself H149.
han i.e. son of HIAB (or HHTE).
-
(1) grand tells us that his
grandfather was 71190T and
that he belonged to भाभल्लवंश
(HTHE family).
(2) अनन्त also states his own
caste as 'ar777fa'.
. (2) He calls himself as de.
scended from नागर वंश (Nagar
family).
(3) He calls himself artigor
भिष.
(3) 377* calls his gand-
father as 7771407 and his father,
Foca, son of attract as facere
and Tongarām.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The identity of the names भाम(भ)ल, नारायण and नागर ज्ञाति (or
नागर वंश)as revealed by the statements of अनन्त and नारायणभिषज् is not
accidental but real. I have, therefore, no doubt that Nārāyana
Bhişaj who completed the ser - hracat is identical with TOT,
the grandfather of wara of A. D. 1457. If this identity is accep-
ted, we can easily see how the study of medicine was co tinued in
this Nāgara family from the grandfather to the grandson, as repre-
sented in the following genealogy and its chronology :-

1325-1400 | 1375--1450 | 1400-1475
As regards the chronology given in the above table, I have to
observe as follows:-
(1) श्रीकण्ठदत्त was the pupil of विजयरक्षित whose date is about
1240 A. D. ( vide Hoernle : Osteology, p. 17 ).
(2) The date of stasuster, the author of saregamat,
would be c. A. D. 1225-1300.
(3) नारायण भिषज् who completed व्याख्या-कुसुमावली, is, there-
fore, later than A D. 1300. In the above table, I have assigned
him to the period A. D. 1325-1400.-
(4) मण्डन the son of नारायण भिषज् may be safely assigned to
the period A. D. 1375-1450.
(5) 778, son of Huga, composed his THERE in A. D. 1457,
when he was a realita. He, therefore, may be assigned to the
period A. D. 1400-1475.
(6) 1, the great grandfather of y , has been assigned
by me to the period A. D. 1275-1350. He appears to have been
contemporancous with श्रीकण्ठदत्त,
I believe that the above chronology is quite reasonable with-
in the limits available to me, viz. c. A. D. 1240, the date of farra.
Trata and A. D. 1457, the date of paar. In this manner, by linking
up the evidence given by a gor Fast and that given by wat, we

amily. Thied by his. The grene
Seat grantin Brandfather
have been able to give the history and chronology of this Nāgara
family of physicians for 200 years ( A. D. 1275-1475).
It would apppear from my evidence that argraon fast belongs
to the 14th century and not the 15th century to which D. K. Shas-
tri has assigned him in his article. अनन्त calls himself as भाभल्ल-
Tia, i. e. born in the family. This vague statement of
warna about his great grandfather is clarified by his grandfather
नारायण भिषज्, who expressly calls himself भाभल्ल-नन्दन. The great
grandson had a vague memory of his great grandfather, but the
grandfather had no such vagueness in calling himself
'the son of H149.' It is, therefore, clear that the genealogy
established by me in this paper, viz. HHG ATIT01-4°57.877-
(A. D. 1457 ) is accurate and reliable.
__अनन्त frequently calls his father as मन्तिन् 'minister' and भूपतीनां
fugiat: 'Royal Physician.' We must investigate the name of the
king at whose court he flourished and served as minister. It is
possible to suppose that Hoga (c. 1375-1450 A. D. ) was patronis-
ed by Ahmad I of Gujarāt ( A. D. 1411-1442 ). In this connection
I may point out that Mahamud Begdā, the grandson of Ahmad I,
had a court Pandit, Udayarāja', who composed a poem called the
Trailarang between A. D. 1458 and 1469.
Ahmad I of Gujarāt ( A. D. 1411-1442) twice attacked Malwa
(in A, D. 1419 and 1422 ), without being able to capture Hoshang
Ghori, who was ruling at Mandu fort between A. D. 1405 and 1432.
I have proved, elsewhere, that Hoshang Ghori had a Jain Prime
Minister of the name Aga, son of anks and grandson of sigur of
श्रीमालवंश. This महाप्रधान मण्डन was a Jain संघपति and composed
several Sanskrit works like $184. Huga, 1817-4097, ARTE -HOST
and tauga. He flourished between A. D. 1405 and 1432, the
period of Hoshang Ghori's rule at Malwa. This ETTECT of
Malwa should not be confounded with APTET of Gujarat ( A.D
1375-1450 ) who was his contemporary with a different genealogy.

24. Date of Vāsudeva's Commentary on the
Vāsavadattā of Subandhu –
Between A. D. 1500 and 1700*
In 1940 I published a paper' on the Dates of Nārāyana Diksita
and Other Commentators of the Vasavadattă of Subandhu. In this
paper I have montioned about 20 commentaries on the Väsavadattā
and tried to fix their probable chronology on the strength of data
then available to me. In 1948 my friend Rao Saheb G. V. Panse,
B. E. of Poona showed to me an incomplete MS? of a commen-
tary on the Vasavadattā containing about 270 folios (11.7 by 4. 4
inches in size ). This MS excited my curiosity as I had not exa-
mined this commentary in my previous paper referred to above.
I, therefore, asked Rao Saheb Panse to prepare a critical analysis
of this MS and submit it to the session of the All-India Oriental
Conference. Rao Saheb Panse accordingly prepared such an
analysis for the Darbhanga Session held in October 1948 and gave
me a copy of it with a request that I should try to fix up the
chronology of this commentary by Vāsudeva represented by the
Baroda MS.
At the time when Rao Saheb Panse requested me to fix up the
chronology of Vāsudeva's commentary under reference I was
engaged in writing a paper on the date of Rasakāmadhenu by Cūdā-
maņi Miśra. This work on alchemy appears to have been com-
posed later than A. D. 1500 according to the evidence recorded by
me in my paper. A comparative study of the historical and
biographical data available in the Rasakāmädhenu and Väsudeva's
commentary on the Vāsavadattâ called Bhuvana-Candrikā or Bhu.
vanärtha Candrikā disclosed quite accidentally that Devanātha, the
father of Vasudeva was possibly identical with Devanātha-Misra,
the guru of Cūdāmaņi Miśra. If this identity could be proved we
can definitely say that Vāsudeva and Cūņāmaņi Miśra were contem-
comparative Rasakāmoana-Can Depanāth

sary to record the extracts from Vāsudeva's commentary on the
strength of which we are in a position to fix up the suggested
identity.

From the above list the reference to रायमुकुटव्याख्यान, evidently
on the Amarakośa, gives us one terminus to the date of Väsudeva.
Rayamukuta composed this commentary in A. D. 1431. We can,
therefore, safely conclude that Vasudeva, the author of the Bhu.
vana-Candrika commentary on the Vasavadattā is later than A. D.
1450. Other datable references in the above list, are मेदिनी
(c. A. D. 1200-1275) and साहित्यदर्पण of Visvanātha) composed
between A. D. 1300 and 1350.' These dates are in harmony with
the date of Rāyamukuța's commentary viz. A. D. 1431.
_On folio 211 of the Baroda MS of Vasudeva's commentary on
the Vasavadattă of Subandhu Vasudeva comments on the following
line in the Väsavadatta :-
“कम्युरिव गगनमहार्णवस्य, पारदपिण्ड हव कालधातुवादिनः "

It is clear from this reference that Devanātha, the father of
Vasudeva, composed a work called the Rasamuktavalia on alchemy.

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORÝ
This statement is in harmony with Vasudeva's description of his
father's proficiency in Ayurveda as recorded in the following verse
9 at the beginning of the commentary :
"आयुर्वेदविबोधविशुद्धधीर्भिनिरूपित इतीह धन्वन्तरिरयमपरो न परो यस्मा.
जिषक कोऽपि ॥ ९॥"
Verily Devanātha was as it were Dhanvantari, the physician
of the gods. There was no other physician superior to him.
We have now to identify the following line in Devanātha's
Rasamuktāvali quoted by Vāsudeva :-
"हरजो रसो मुकुंदः पारदसूतौ रसेन्द्रनामानि"
This line is not found in the Anandāśrama MS of the Rasa-
muktāvali, which is anonymous. The three MSS of the Rasamukta-
vali mentioned by Aufrecht are not accessible to me and conse-
quently I cannot say if the above line can be traced in any of these
three MSS. In this connection I have to point out that Cūdāmani
Miśra in his work on alchemy called the Rasakāmadhenu (ed. by
Jadavaji Trikamji Acharya, Bombay, 1925) quotes from a work on
alchemy by his guru Devanātha Miśra some verses as follows :-
Page 379 - " तथा च मद्गुरुश्रीदेवनाथमिश्रा:-
नूतनघटाकपालं दुग्धयूक्तकं विभाव्य विज्ञानी।
वद्यो मुखेऽस्य वस्त्रं शुद्धं बध्दा भृशं रज्ज्वा ॥ ३१ ॥"

the same metre-āryā

(Continued from the previous page)
Rao Saheb Panse showed me a copy of MS No. 2540 in the
Anandasrma, Poona. This is a MS of रसमुक्तावली.
It begins: -"श्रीगणेशायनमः ।

The MS ends -- " इति रसमुक्तावली समाप्तः"

DATE OF VASUDEVA'S COMMENTARY ON VÅSAVADATTA
187
The line from Duvananātha's Rasamuktavali quoted by Vāsu.
deva very probably belongs to the treatise on rasavidya composed
by Devanathamisra, the guru of Cūdāmaņi Misra. If this surmise
is correct we can easily deduce the following conclusions :-
(1) Devanātha, the father of Vasudeva is identical with Deva-
nåthamiśra, the guru of Cūdāmaņimiśra.
(2) Devanatha, Vasudeva and Cudamanimisra were all con-
temporaries and consequently the relative chronology of their
works would be as follows :--
(i) रसमुक्तावली is earlier than the भुवनद्रिका of वासुदेव.
(ii) रसमुक्तावली is also earlier than the रसकामधेनु of चूडामणिमिश्र,
(iii) As the रसकामधेनु of चडामणिमिश्र is later than A. D. 1500 the
dates of the रसमुक्तावली and the भुवनचन्द्रिका also get shifted to a
period, which is later than A. D. 1500.
The MS of Rasamuktāvali mentioned by Aufrecht as “B. 4.
236” is dated Samvat 1728 = A. D. 1672. If this Rasamuktavali
is identical with the Rasamuktāvali of Devanātha we can infer that
these three authors viz (1) Devanātha, (2) his pupil Cūdāmani.
miśra and (3) Väsudeva (Devanātha's son) flourished between
A. D. 1500 and 1672.
We have seen above that Vāsudeva belonged to a Sākadvipi
Brahmin family. His father's pupil Cūņāmaņi Miśra also belonged
to a Sakadvi pi Brahmin family as stated by him in the following
verses found in the Rasakāmadhenu :-
Page 128 ( at the end of Pada I)-
"शाकद्वीपजविप्रमुख्यसुभिषक् संख्यावदाख्यातिमन्मिश्रश्रीवलभद्रसूनुहरिराम-
स्यात्मसंभूतिना।

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
In my paper on the Rasakāmadhenu I have pointed out some
Mantras in Hindi quoted by its author on pp. 48, 409 etc. This
fact would warrant an inference that Cūdāmaņi Miéra and his
Sākadvipi Brahmin family belonged to Northern India. The com-
mentator Vasudeva and his Sākadvipi: Brahmin family may also be
taken to be a North Indian family, very probably belonging to the
United Provinces.
A work called the Rasaratnapradipa is mentioned in the
Rasakāmadhenu ( pp. 177, 370 etc. ) If this Räsaratnapradipa ( on
alchemy) is identical with the Rasaratnapradipal of Rāmarāja
(c. A. D. 1475 ) we get additional corroboration for our earlier
limit for the date of the Rasakamadhenu? viz. A. D. 1500.

follows:-
"In the sequel...five classes (Original Text in § 91)."'

Padmini."
1. The statement of the system of Suśruta in the Särira Pad-

sion of Dr. P. Cordier runs as follows:
“ Tapi fata ......... 377 BYTE 11 6011"' " --2T-TA ......

2. The commentary of Vaidyanātha, called Padmini Prabodha
on the above given statement runs as follows:-" TITTA FOTO......

Translation :-"Because of the conciseness of the statement of
the bones etc."
From the foregoing references we get the following
information:
(1) Name of the work :- TIÊUrrat. (2) Author :- HEFT HE.
(3) Date of the MS of the work with Dr. P. Cordier :- Samvat
1735 = A. C. 1678.
(4) Name of the Commentary on the work :- graafigata by
gart.
(5) Date of Composition of freqfarat About 1000 A. C. accord.
ing to Hoernle.
I am not aware of the grounds on which Hoernle assigns the
Titgaat to "about A. D. 1000.” It appears, however, that
Hoernle had not personally examined the MS of the work in the
possession of Dr. P. Cordier. The date "about A. D. 1000" for
this work given by Hoernle is absolutely wrong and misleading as
will be seen from the following evidence :-
(1) Aufrecht makes no mention of any work of the name BTTTT.
Orwal in this Catalogus Catalogorum.
- (2) In 1944 Rajavaidya S. A. Jigatap of Kolhapur sent to me
a MS of the earthcaraat by Bhāskara Apāji Agnihotri. I have gent
. for publication a paper on this work.

(3) The Särira-Padmini of Bhāskara Bhatta referred to by
Hoerole in his remarks quoted in extenso above is identical with
the work represented by the Jagatap MS of the Sarirapadmini of
Bhāskar Apāji Agnihotri. Verses 70 (atari etc.) and 71 (AH-97 FT
- Ta etc.) quoted by Hoernle from the Cordier MS of the FRIT-
gfuaft are exactly identical with those numbered 70 and 71 in
the Jagatap MS. The Jagtap MS contains 110 verses in all.
(4) The Jagatap MS of the Sārirapadmini was copied in A. D.
1791 (Saka 1713, Viroddhakrt Samvatsara Vaišākha suddha
Pratipad.)
(5) The Jagatap MS of the Titaff records in the follow-
ing verse the date of composition of the work as follows :-
"शरवह्निहयेन्दुहायने विभवे भास्वत उत्तरायणे।
इयमत्र समापिता सिते ग्रहतिथ्यां शुभमाधवासिते ॥ ११०॥"
The chronogram" TT, af, 64, 7" gives us Sanivat 17.35 as
the date of composition of the work. Dr. Hoernle states on p. 70
of Osteology that the Cordier MS of the Titafuaft is also dated 1735
(Samvat). I am of opinion that either Hoernle or Cordier has
taken the date of composition of the work as the date of the copy.
(6) The genealogy of Bhāskara as given in the verses 96, 97, 98
of the Titraat tallies with that recorded by him in his other
works like the स्मृतिप्रकाश, पद्यामृततरङ्गिणी and others recorded by
Aufrecht. His ancestor TETITA HE of the fact family belonged
to त्र्यंबकेश्वरपुर. His son was हरिभट्ट. His son was आपाजिभट्ट resident
of repeta or Benares. 39Th is described as the "resort of men
in pounding down diseases' ("Tegalai angarai T704:"). His
son was HTFT the author of the Titafuat, which is evidently a
tribute to his physician father. The colophon describes the
अग्निहोत्रि family as "काश्यपान्वय" i.e. of the काश्यपगोत्र,
(7) Bhaskara’s gergaarigot was composed in A. D. 1676. The
Erftraforaf was composed in A. D. 1679 as we have seen above.
These dates harmonize with each other.
(8) The Exfagra of Bhāskara is represented by MS No. 161
of Visrama I in the Government MSS Library at the B. O. R. In-
stitute, Poona. On folios 186-187 of this MS Bhāskara mentions
and quotes from his own Ticaret as follows :-
"an ATARETATTFIT APESA ZEITIGITAL
संकोचं गतवति तत्र हस्पयोजेति निद्रास्याद्विषयत इन्द्रियोपरामान् ।
चिौकानुपरजितो भवेजनानाम् स्वमं तद्विकसति सत्वतोवबोध इति ॥"

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The above stanza te......79: is identical with verse 30 of
the Jagatap Ms of the शारीरपधिनी. The MS of the स्मृतिप्रकाश is
dated Samvat 1808 = A. D. 1752.
I have not traced any MS of the commentary Padmini-
prabodha (on the Särirapadmini) by Vaidyanātha. Evidently this
commentary is later than A. C. 1679. Bhāskara's Smytiprakāśa
which mentions the firfaraft, is also later than A. C. 1679. In
my paper op Bhāskara referred to by me already in this paper
I have recorded the known chronology of the works of this author
including the date of the Sārīrapadmini and I have to invite the
attention of readers to this paper containing the evidence on which
this chronology is based.
The evidence recorded above is sufficient to disprove the
wrong date of Bhāskara viz. A. D. 1000 given by Hoernle. Bhāskara
Apāji:Agnihotri was a Deccani Brahmin of the Kasyapa gotra. He
was a Deśastha Rgvedi Brahmin. We have in the Mahārāșțra some
members of the Agnihotri family even today but I have no evi-
dence to connect these members with Bhāskara's line, which
migrated from Tryambakeśvara to 'Benares c. A. D. 1650 and
settled there. We can have a clear idea of the contribution to
Sanskrit learning by Mahārāșțra Pandits only when we have
studied and published the history of each family through several
generations with special reference to its literary contribution
as revealed by published and unpublished sources.

In Appendix II of his Third Report ( Extra Number of j. B.
B. R. A. S., Bombay, 1887) Peterson has given extracts from
MSS preserved in different libraries (pp. 191-379). Among these
extracts he bas given on pp. 354-355 an extract' from a MS of
Jagatprakasakãoya dated A. D. 1644 in Kotah library.
____It is clear from the date A. D. 1644 of this MS that Visvanatha
Vaidya is earlier than A. D. 1644 and later than the Medini lexicon
to which he refers in his Košakalpataru as pointed out by
Aufrecht. I have proved elsewhere that the date of the Medini
lexicon lies between c. A. D. 1200 and 1275. In view of this
date we may safely fix up the date of Visvanātha Vaidya between
say about A. D. 1350 and 1650. These limits will be narrowed
down on the strength of evidence to be recorded in this paper.

Peterson records an extract' from the MS of this Kävya, preserved
in the Boondi library on p. 342 of this Third Report referred to
above. This extract discloses the name of Visvanātha's mother
viz. "Rukmini"which is not found in the extracts from his two
other works recorded by Peterson.
I note below some information about Visvanātha as gathered
from the extracts quoted by Peterson from (1) The Košakalpataru
(B. O. R. I. MS), (2) Jagatprakāśakāvya (Kotah MS) and (3)
Satrusalyacarita ( Boondi MS):-
(I) Košakalpataru.
(1) In line 3 at the commencement the author bows to his
father Nārāyana as follows:-
" श्रीनारायणनामानमानम्य पितरं चिरम् ।
कोषकल्पतरं कुर्मः शर्मणे कविसंसदः॥"
दुः" of विदर्भदेशातgalso me
(2) Verse 67 at the end of the MS mentions his father as
"नारायणः बुधः" of देवालय पत्तन" the capital town of Devalaya in the
Vidarbha Country (विदर्भदेशतिलके देवालये पत्तने) noted for its learning
(faruruf). This Nārāyaṇa is also mentioned as hailing from a
family of physicians (वैद्यकुलजः ).
(3) Verse 68 refers to Narayana as having possessed matchless
proficiency in Ayurveda.

(1) The expression “ PASITITUTTU FA: " at the begin-
ning of the MS has possibly a reference to
Nārāyaṇa, the father of Visvanātha, as also to god
Nārāyaṇa.

ment to a family of physicians. This Visvanatha
composed the Satrusalyacarita.
(2) The colophon states that the Satrusalyacarita was
composed by Visranātha, son of Vaidya Nārāyana
in 22 Sargas. King Satrusalya' is called “Mabā-
rājādhirāja" in this colophon.
On the strength of the above data we can represent the genea-
logy of Visvanātha, the author of the Košakalpataru as follows :-
(Vaidya) Nārāyaṇa (of Devalaya, capital of Vidarbha
country) (married Rukmiņi)
(Vaidya) Visvanatha wrote three works :-
(1) Kośakalpataru
(2) Jagatprakāśakāvya ( MS of A.D. 1644 )
(3) Śatruśalyacarita
The Jagatprakāśakāvya was composed by Vaidya Visvanātha
in praise of Mahārāņā Jagatsiṁha who ruled the Udaipur (or

1. This king Satrusalya is identical with Jam Sattarsal of Nava-
nagar in Kathiawar. He ruled from A. D. 1569-1608 ( See Bumbay
Gazetteer Vol. VIII, pp. 566-567 and 569). He was a patron of learned
men. He patronized a poet named 11702a Tèl, the author of a work
called t ry (See my article on this work in the Annals (B. 0. R.

Mewar) State from A. D. 1628 to 1653. As the Kotah MS of this
Kävya is dated 1644 the date of composition of this poem lies
between A. D. 1628 and 1644. This poem appears to have been
composed after A. D. 1628 as it describes Jagatsimha as a ruling
King (cf. क्षोणीमंडलमंडन in the last verse 72 and "चित्रकूटसार्वभौम" in
the colophon). Evidently the Kotah MS of A. D. 1644 is a con-
temporary copy of this poem and hence very important. We
must also see what light it throws on the history of Udaipur as
the poem is possibly complete in 14 sargas.
Pandit Chitrav Shasari makes the following remarks about
Jagatsimha Guhilot on p. 387 of his Madhyayugina Caritrakoša,
Poona, 1937 :-
"Sama yesta - (Born A. D. 1607 - Died A. D. 1652 )
-Mahārāņa of Udaipur, Son of Karnasimha. His corona-
tion took place in March 1628. He defended his kingdom
bravely when Jehangir invaded it. He pleased Emperor
Shah Jahan by sending him a Nazrāņā. He effected repairs
to the Chitod fort and built two palaces. Many inscriptions
of this king are available. Jagannātha Paņditarāya compos-
ed a poem called the “Jagadābharaṇa" in 50 Slokas in
praise of Jagatsimha' and presented it to him about A. D.
1627. Jagatsimha was a lover of horses of costly breeds,
besides being celebrated for his liberality and prudence.
He died on 10th October 1652."
I am unable to verify the above remarks of Chitrav Shastri as
he has not referred to the sources on which they are based. The
work intarzt is difinitely in praise of Jagat Simha of Udaipur but
the connection of marator with this Jagatsimha has not been proy-
1. Cf. the following remarks of Prof. V. A. Ramaswami Sastri in
his " Jagannatha Pandita ” (Annamalai University Series, 1942):
P. 14. — (Foot note 3) "S. M. Paranjpe conjectures (in his intro-
duction to his edition of the Bhâminiviläsa ) that the poem (GITATU)
is an encomium of Jagatsimha, the Rajput prince, who came to power
in 1628. But this view does not find any support among scholars."
P. 54 -"S. M. Paranjpe, however, conjectures on the support
of a manuscript reading of some verses and a colophon of the work
that it is a panegyric of the Rajput prince Jagatsimha, son of Krşņa
(Karna ?) simha of Udaipur etc. But what led Jagannatha to eulogisc
Jagatsimha in a poem is not known.'

ed on contemporary documentary evidence. Is there any evidence
of the contact of Jagannatha Paņạitarāya with Jagatsimha I of
Udaipur? There is no chronological difficulty in this matter as
Jagatsimha lived between A. D. 1607 and 1652 while the date of
Jagonātha Pandita is "c. A. D. 1590 – 1665" ( Vide p. 25 of
Ramaswami Sastri's “Jagannatha Pandita" (1942)].
The chronology of Visvanātha Vaidya, his works and patrons
discussed by me so far may be represented as follows:-
Chronology
A. D.
Particulars
1569-1608 Jām Sattarsāl (777) reigoed at Navanagar. He
patronized श्रीकण्ठ कवि, the author of रसकौमुदी and
विश्वनाथ वैद्य the author of शत्रुशल्यचरित (in 22 Sargas).
1596 - Date of B. O. R. Institute MS of TART
1607 - Birth of F AE, son of Sofite of Udaipur ( Mewar ).
1628-1652 - जगत्सिंह, the patron of विश्वनाथ वेध ruled at Udaipur
- Possibly the TTTET ISTT26174 was composed between
1628 and 1644 by laurar du.
1644 - Date of the Kotah MS of T93197*154 in praise of
Fofine described by Peterson (2nd Report').
It is evident from the above table that our author Visvanatha
Vaidya was first patronized by Jām Sattarsāl of Navanagar. Per-
haps after the death of this patron in A. D. 1608 Visvanātha may
have sought other patrons or may have remained without a patron
for a period of more than 20 years. After A. D. 1628 he found a
patron in King Jagatsimha, Son of Karnasimha, of Udaipur
(Mewar ) and wrote a kávya in his honour between A. D. 1628 and
1644 as we have proved above.
In the light of the above evidence we can safely fix up the
chronology of Viśvanātha Vaidya, say between A.D. 1570 and 1655.
Let us now see what further light can be thrown on the life history
of this author from contemporary sources. In this connection I
have to record the following evidence :-
In 1937 Pandit Jagannātha Krşnalál Šāstri of Pratapgad
( Rajputana ) sent me a copy of a Kaoya edited by him. The
name of this Kdoya is Haribhūşaşam and its author's name is
Mahakavi Gangårāma. This printed edition of 97 pages contains

9 Sargas, of which the 9th Sarga extends upto the 6th stanza
only. Evidently the edition is based on an incomplete MS of the
work. This poem is in praise of Maharaja Hari simha of the
Pratapgad State who ruled from A. D. 1629 to 1676 (V. S. 1685 to
1732 according to the Editor). The date of composition of the
poem is discussed by the editor on pp. 2-3 of his Hindi Introduc-
tion. According to him the poem was composed between A. D.
1635 and 1649 in which year Maharaja Harisimha of Pratapgad
founded the temple of Govardhananātha at Decalia the old
capital of the Pratapgad State at the desire of his mother Sri
Campā Kumvar. This temple was founded at the hands of Pandita
Visvanātha', who is praised in this poem in Sarga VIII (Stanza 37-
39) as follows:-

The above verses contain a fine tribute to the learning and
abilities of Visvanātha, who is described as proficient in all arts
1. The contemporaries of Viſvanātha at the court of Harisiṁha
( A. D. 1629-1676) mentioned by Gangarama in the Haribhusana
Kavya (Sarga VIII) are:-
(i) कल्यागदास (v. 35)-पुरोहित.
(ii) गोदाभट्ट (v. 36)-पुराणिक.

and sciences like 1910, HIHIAT, ara, Aneta, alas, 7719701, 917%,
TTT737T etcAs the date of the poem is fixed by the editor
between A.D. 1635 and 1649 we can inſer that Visvanatha was at this
time a man of established literary repute. As he was present in
A. D. 1649 at the foundation of the temple of Govardhananātha
at his hands we can easily presume that he was a man. advanced in
years and was then respected both for his age and learning. Let
us now see if we can identify this Visvanātha with Visa anàtha
Vaidya, the author of the Košakalpataru. My grounds in favour
of such an identification are as follows:-
(1) Verse 67 at the end of the MS of Viśvanātha Vaidya's
Kośākalpataru mentions that Nārāyaṇa, the father of Viśvanātha
Vaidya belonged to "FIZI TER" (town of Devālaya) the chief
town of the Vidarbha country ("विदर्भदेशतिलके देवालये पत्तने"). I
have already suggested that this qara 9777 is identical with Deolia
the old capital of the Pratapgad State.
(2) In the Haribhușana-Kavya, Deolia is called "a 777"
(1, 5, 8, etc.) and kings of Pratapgad are called "gam ” (1. 11.
12, VIII, 3); See also “aaagt” (VIII, 5,). Harisimha is called
" TO " (VIII, 14, ) and "aegiratz" (VIII, 16, 19), "Sana"
(VIII, 42; IX, 1, 3).
(3) Phonetically “Deolia " is more akin to “Devalaya”
than “ Devala" and I have no doubt that Deolia is identical with
"देवालय पत्तन" mentioned by Visvanātha Vaidya and with " देवल
qaz” mentioned by Gangārāma in his Haribhūṣaṇakāvya.
(4) Viśvanātha Vaidya's father Nārāyana hailed from Deolia
in the Pratapgad state ; it is but natural that he should be invited
to found the temple of Sri Govardhananātha of Deolia (in A. D.
1649 ) his native place.
If the above grounds are accepted we can represent the
chronology of Viśvanātha Vaidya's contact with different royal
patrons as follows:
6. A. D. 1590 - 1608 - Contact of V (= Viſvanātha Vaidya)
with Jam Sattarsal of Navanagar as
proved by V's authorship of the
Satrusalya Carita. Evidently V was
a budding poet at this time, say
about 25-30 years old.
A.D. 1628 - 1644 - Contact of V with Kiog Jagatsinha of

Page 233****************************************************************************************

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
ing Ho at the the tem
Udaipur as proved by V's Jagatprakaſa-
Kavya (Kotah MS of A. D. 1644 ).
A. D. 1649 - Foundation of the temple of Govardhananātha
at Deolia at the hands of V during the reign of
King Harisimha of Deolia.
A. D. 1635 – 1649 – V praised in three verses in the Hari-
bhūşana-Kavya as a very learned man
well versed in different sciences and
arts.
Presuming that V was born about A. D 1580, he must have
been about 69 years old in A. D. 1649 when the Queen Mother
Campå invited him to found the temple of Govardhananātha at
Deolia, the native place of V's father Nārāyaṇa. V may have
continued to live upto A.D. 1660 thus reaching his 80th year during
the reign of King Harisimha of Deolia (A. D. 1629–1676). At any
rate we shall be fairly correct in assigning the literary career of
Visvanātha Vaidya to the period, A. D. 1600-1650.
It is clear from the evidence recorded so far that Visvanatha
Vaidya, the author of the Košakalpataru enjoyed the patronage of
(1) Navanagar court in his youth, (2) of Udaipur court in his
middle age and (3) of the Pratapgad ( Deolia ) court in his old age.
In all the evidence gathered so far I have not been able to deter-
mine the limits for the date of the Kośakalpataru but I have reason
to believe that the lexicon must have been composed prior to
A. D. 1649, when he was invited to found a temple at Deolia and
when he was known to be a man of great literary repute, well
versed in V yakarana and other branches of Sanskrit learning
specified by Gangārāma in his Haribhüşana-Kavya composed
between A. D. 1635 and 1649 according to its editor Pandit
Jagannātha Sāstri of Pratapgad.

27. The Date of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi
of Sadānanda Kāśmīraka — Between
A. D. 1600 and 1700*
While engaged in the work of preparing a Bibliography of
Indian Philosophy, I had occasion to note the following contra-
dictory statements of Dr. Surendranath Dasgupta regarding the
date of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi and its author Sadananda
Kāśmiraka :-
"Another important syncretistic Vedānta writer is Sadananda
Kāsmīraka, author of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi, who lived in the
early part of the eighteenth century. The Advaitabrahmasiddhi is an
excellent summary of all the most important Vedānta doctrines
in the different schools of Advaita teachers” (p. 57 of History of
Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, Cambridge, 1932).
"Mr. Tripathi collects the names of some of these writers as
Prajñānānanda, Šeşa Sārngadhara Vādivāgīśvara, Vadindra,
Rāmānanda Sarasvati, Sadānanda Käśmiraka (A. D. 1547 ),
Kļşņānanda (A. D. 1650), Maheśvara Tirtha (A. D. 1650) and
others" (Ibid, p. 196 ).
M. M. Prof. Kuppusvami Sastri in his Introduction to the
Brahmasiddhi (Madras, 1937, p. xxii) refers to the Advaitabrahma.
siddhi as follows:-
"The Advaitabrahmasiddhi by Sadānanda and the Stärājya-
siddhi by Gangadharendra. Sarasvati are comparatively later and
less important; and the former of these two works is similar to
the Advaitasiddhi and controverts in general the dualistic, plura-
listic and non-Vedic doctrines opposed to Advaitism etc".
The foregoing remarks of two great scholars could not satisfy
my curiosity about the date of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi. This
work was edited by Vāmana Šāstri Islampurkar in the Bibliotheca
Indica (Calcutta) in 1890. In the Sanskrit introduction to this
edition (p. 5) the Editor concludes that the author lived in the

latter half of the 18th century of the Vikrama Era ("Qaf198981977-
72-3 sprata") according to external evidence but internal
evidence leads the Editor to conclude that he is not later than the
first half of the 16th century (" TEETITaflafaia a arata:").
In spite of these statements the editor feels uncertain about the
date of the author but observes that there is no doubt that the author
is eariler than Sri Vallabhācārya, the originator of the Visuddhā.

(" stop plaa 9434 fhà act ITETIT ... ... SHEGHAtica ou em

In view of these conflicting and varied conclusions about the
date of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi and its author Sadānanda
Kāśmiraka, I propose in this paper to record some evidence about
this date of a more reliable type than that so far gathered by pre-
vious scholars. Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum makes the
following entries about Sadananda Kāśmiraka and his works :-

In the above list of references the reference to Paficadati (No.4)
is evidently to the work of this name by Sāyaṇa, who died in
A. D. 1387. This reference would make Sadānanda posterior to
C. A. D. 1400. Another reference of chronological value is that
to Narasimhasrama (No. 21) who appears to be identical with
Nșsimhāśrama, the guru of Bhattoji Dikşita.' Nșsiṁhāśrama is the
author of many works on Vedānta, one of which viz. the Tattva-
viveka was composed in A.D. 1547 at Purusottamapura according
to Aufrecht. This evidence would shift the eariler limit for
Sadānanda's date from A. D. 1400 to A. D. 1600.

DATE OF THE ADVAITABRAHMASIDDHI
207
Let us now see if any of the above references can enable us
to fix up the earlier limit to the date of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi.
(1) The reference to Siromani is found as follows on p. 9 of
the Edition :
"Tarietà fattaforat.........afenaa 11"
Evidently, this is a reference to the logician Raghunatha
Siromani who flourished about A. D. 1500 according to S. Vidya-
bhusana ( p. 388 of History of Indian Logic, Calcutta, 1921).
(2) On p. 31 of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi Sadānanda mentions
and quotes from the Vedāntamuktāvalī :-
" उक्तं च वेदान्तमुक्तावलीकृभिः।
991 wat............ *# "
Very possibly the Vedāntamuktāvalī referred to above is
identical with the Vedāntasiddhänta-muktavali of Prakāśānanda, who
"lived in the latter half of the sixteenth ceutury” (i. e. between
A. D. 1550 and 1600 ) according to Dr. Das Gupta.'
(3) On p. 31 of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi Sadānanda refers to
Vijñānabhikşu as follows :-
" एतेन यच्चान सांख्यभाष्यकृता विज्ञानभिक्षुणा समाधान-
स्वेन प्रलपितं तदपि असंगतमेव ।"
Vijñānabhikṣu lived between A. D. 1525 and 1600 and his pupil
Bhāvā Ganesa, the leader of Citpävan Brahmins at Benares signed
a nirnayapatra dated A.D. 1583 as I have shown in a special paper.?
In view of this chronology for Vijñānabhikṣu I am inclined to
believe that Sadānanda Kasmiraka, the author of the Advaita-
brahmasiddhi is later than A. D. 1575.
(4) Similar to the reference to Nșsiṁhāśiama in Sadānanda's
atrag latura on the strength of which I have suggested c. A. D. 1600
as the earlier limit for Sadānanda's date, another reference is found
on p. 271 of the Advaitabrahmasiddhi edition as follows :-
1. Vide p. 17 of History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. II (1932)
footnote.
2. Vide pp. 20-28 of Adyar Library Bulletin for February 1944.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERASY HISTORY
" नरसिंहाश्रमाणां मते तु-
" BEETJATHTEEN 1A#rpofafa.......
........... 675 Fagoraturasitraffet fa fagtra: 1 "
This quotation is evidently from some work of Narasimhāśrama
(also known as Nrsimhāśrama) on Vedānta. I could not identify
it as the works of Nșsiṁhāśrama are not available to me for
reference.
The cumulative effect of all the references recorded above
makes Sadānanda posterior to c. A. D. 1575 or 1600. Let us now
try to fix the later limit for Sadānanda's date.
One of the MSS' used by Vāmana Šāstri for his edition of the
Advaitahrahmasiddhi is called by him Ka (F). This MS is dated
Samvat 1761, Jyeștha Krsna pakșa, dvitīyā? which is equal to
Thursday, 8th June 170.1.3 In view of this date of one of the MSS
of the Alvaitabrahmasiddhi we may safely fix A. D. 1700 as the
later limit for Sadananda's date.
In verse 1 at the beiginning of the Advaita brahmasiddhi Sadā-
nanda bows to his guru Brahmānanda as follows :-
"नमामि सदगुरुं शान्तं ब्रह्मानन्दं मुनीश्वरम् ।
यत्कृपालबलेशेन सत्तस्फुरणं मम ॥ १॥"
In verse 2 Sadānanda bows to one Nārāyaṇācārya as follows :-
" श्रीमन्नारायणाचार्य सनातनशिवं सदा ।
वंदेऽहं वाङ्मनःकार्यद्वैतध्वान्तनिवृत्तये ॥२॥"
If we succeed in identifying Brahmananda and Nārāyaṇācārya, who
were apparently his senior contemporaries, we may be able to
throw some additional light on the date of Sadānanda Kāśmiraka.
Unfortunately this identification is difficult as we find many
authors of the names Nārāyana and Brahmānanda recorded by
Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum. For the present I may

make the following tentative remarks on the identification of
Brahmananda and Narayanåcårya mentioned by Sadananda :-
I – Brahmananda ( author of Nyåyaratnávali on the
Siddhantabindu)
(1) One Brahmananda wrote a commentary called the Nyåya.
ratndoali (or Ratnävali) on the Siddhantabindu of Madhusüdana
Sarasvati. In the colophon of this Nyåyaratnávali the author is
called Brahmananda Sarasvati, while in verse 2 at the beginning he
calls himself merely Brahmananda (“ autarea rega").'
(2) In the two verses at the end of the Nyåyaratnávali
Brahmānanda mentions Nārāyaṇatirtha as his guru along with one
Paramananda-Sarasvati.
(3) On p. 3 of the Nyayaratnávali Brahmananda refers to
Kalpataru-ţika Parimala in the following extract:-
"शारीरकमीमांसारूपचतुराध्यायीतद्भाव्यतदीयटीकावाचस्पत्यतदीयटीका-
कल्पतरुतदीयटीकापरिमलरूपप्रन्थपञ्चक-इत्यर्थः ॥"
The author of the Kalpataru-Parimala is the celebrated Appaya
Dikşita, who flourished between A. D. 1520 and 1592 (Vide p. 148 of
Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, Vol. III-article by Mahālinga
Sāstri). It is clear from this reference that Brahmananda, the
author of the Nyāyaratnávali is later than c. A. D. 1592.
II — Gauda Brahmānanda
(1) In the edition of the Säriraka-Mimāṁsa-Vārtika and its
Vivarana by Ananta Krishna'Sastri and A. Bhattacharya (Calcutta
University, 1941 ) we find Nyāyaratnávali mentioned as the work
of Gauda Brahmananda? (See Introduction).
(2) This Gauda Brahmānanda was the pupil of Nārāyaṇānanda
who completed a prose Vārtika on the Brahmasūtra in A. D. 1592.
(3) This Gauda Brahmananda was the guru of Bälakrşnānanda
(also called Abhinava-Dravidācārya) author of the Säriraka
Mimämsä-Vārtika ( see p. xxviii of Introduction) who fourished
about A. D. 1650.
1. Vide Siddhantabindu with Ratnávali ed. by Harihara Šāstri

as the work of Gauda Brahmananda,

(4) Gauda Brahmananda was the contemporary of Gadadhara
Bhattåcårya ( see p. 481 of History of Indian Logic by S. Vidya-
bhusana ) who lived about A. D. 1650.
The evidence about the name-sakes of Brahmananda and

recorded in this paper.

under the entry "Hall, p. 109”.i.e. p. 109 of Hall's Bibliography,

Madhusudana Sarasvati's sigarafe and annotations on it by the epito-
mator" viz. Brahmananda Sarasvati, disciple of Nārāyanatirtha and
Paramānanda Sarasvati. This MS bears the date Vikrama year 1743
= A. D. 1687. This date pushes back the date of Brahmananda to a
period A. D. 1592-1650. (It may be mentioned here that 970 TRITTE
is a commentary on the ferrataag of Madhusudana Sarasvati and not
a commentary on the sharaft of Madhusūdana Sarasvati).

28. Quotations from the Śrngāra-Sañjīvini of
Harideva Misra in the Sloka - Samgraha of
Maạirāma - Between A. D. 1650 and 1700*
informpublishedtely I cou
Aufrecht mentions only once an author of the name Harideva
Misra' and the only work recorded against his name is forma ,
a MS of which has been recorded by Kielhorn. Sometime ago
my friend Mr. K. M. K. Sarma, Curator of the Anup Sanskrit
Library, Bikaner, published a work called the mostiaraît by one
ficare based on a rare MS of this work. Since the publication
of this work I was on a look-out for some additional information
about this author and his works but unfortunately I could not trace
such information in published or unpublished sources. Recently,
however, I came across some information of the type required by
me but before I record it in this paper I note below some points
from Mr. Sarma's remarks on Haridevamisra in his Introduction
to the edition of the Akabarasähi-Śrngåra-darpana in which the
*Ottäistaraft is published as an Appendix. These points are as
follows :
(1) sinicazifaaft (=SS) is a poem of about 100 verses on a 17.
(2) The only MS of SS is deposited with the number 3143 in
the Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner.
(3) The last folio of this MS is "blank except for the title of
the work and the name of Grieza Aforro who was a great
scholar at the court of Maharaja Anup Singhji."

(4) From the concluding verses of the SS we get some infor.
mation about the author which may be represented as
follows:
नीलमणि
Son
tirtala ( married agaft)
Son
हरिदेवमिश्र
(alias ZIMTĀS )
I author of SS ) born and lived at
HYTIST, later lived at artioreft or Benares-
Patronized by लक्ष्मणचन्द्रदेव in whose
household he was known as लालमिश्र
(5) The SS was composed by its author to please God fazant
(of Benares ).
(6) Aufrecht (CC I, 757 ) mentions one tra are as the author
of कर्णकुतूहल काव्य, He is perhaps the same as the author
of the SS.
(7) As the Bikaner MS of the SS belonged to sifa AfOTtra of
the 17th century, graafhs should be considered earlier
than this date.
(8) Rajendra Lala Mitra ( Notices, No. 129 ) mentions one
हरिजीवनमिश्र as the author of a drama विजयपारिजात (MS dated
A. D. 1673). In the colophon the parentage of the author
is given as follows :-
लालमिश्र
Son
हरिजीवनमिश्र
(author of fanaathra-MS of A. D. 1673). This
लालमिश्र is possibly identical with हरिदेवमिश्र also
known as लालमिश्र
(9) From the evidence recorded above Mr. Sarma thinks that
Ergafas, the author of the SS is earlier than the 17th
century.
To corroborate the above conclusion of Mr. Sarma about the
date of birgafas I have to record the following additional evidence
from a new source discovered by me,

(1) The Govt. MSS Library at the B O. R. Institute possesses
a unique MS of a big anthology of about 1605 verses (MS
No. 361 of 1884-86).
(2) The name of this anthology is श्लोकसंग्रह (or पद्यसंग्रह)compil-
ed by its author AfOTTIĦ for the benefit of his son as stated
in the introductory verse.
(3) I have proved in a special paper' that this मणिराम, the
author of the श्लोकसंग्रह, is definitely later than A.D. 1600 as
he quotes from अकबरीय-कालिदास and records 4-5 verses
composed by him in praise of Raja Todarmalla (टोडरेश),
the finance minister of Emperor Akbar ( A. D. 1542-1605 ).
(4) So far no verses have been traced in any; 'work from the
शंगारसंजीविनी of हरिदेव मिश्र, which was brought to light for the
first time by my learned friend Mr. K. M. K. Sarma. My
study of the श्लोकसंग्रह of मणिराम has brought to light the
following verses of naast quoted with the name of the
author by AfOTTA and traced by me in the published text

In the above table I have traced at least 30 verses of हरिदेव.
मिश्र in the शृंगारसंजीविनी as found in the श्लोकसंग्रह of मणिराम, while the
Bikaner MS belonging to HTOITIA girea of the 17th century shows a
fairly correct text of these verses. The Jaipur copy of the stroom
संग्रह made in 1886 shows many scribal errors. It would be better
if the Jaipur original of the 1886 copy can be recovered and used
for an edition of the श्लोकसंग्रह, which a scholar like Prof. N. A.
Goré can undertake as he has agreed to study this rare MS very
closely and give us a critical analysis of it before long. It would
be in the fitness of things if the Bikaner Darbar can undertake an
edition of this rare anthology by मणिराम दीक्षित, who was protegé of

the work to a scholar like Prof. Gore who has already brought out
critical editions of some Sanskrit Kävyas in recent years. Since
the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner was reorganized by the
Bikaner Darbar through the well-planned efforts of Sardar Major
K. M. Panikkar, the present Prime Minister of Bikaner and his
friend Dr. C. Kunhan Raja of the Madras University, much useful
literary work has been done at Bikaner. In fact this activity has
linked up Bikaner not only with the different centres of learning
in India but also outside. In the present paper I have tried to
link up my discovery of an anthology by a protégé of Maharaja
Anup Singhji of Bikaner with the rare MS of the Testfaat be-
longing to this protégé and deposited in the Bikaner Library,
which bears the sacred name of Maharaja Anup Singhji, a great
lover and patron of Sanskrit learning.

29. A Rare Manuscript of the Sloka-
Samgraha Anthology by Maņirāma and the
Date of Its Composition ( Between A. D. 1650
and 1700*
The only MS of an anthology by AJUTIA recorded by Aufrecht
is the following :-
CC I, 677 - " श्लोकसंग्रह by मणिराम Peters 3. 396"
This MS is identical with MS No. 361 of 1884-86 in the Govt.
MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. It consists of about
96 folios (10 lines to a page and 52 letters to a line) of modern
paper. The MS begins :-
"ॐ श्रीगणेशाय नमः

मासोत्तमे द्वितीयकजेष्ठ कृष्णा ८ मंदवासरे लीपकृतं ब्राह्मण पारीक हरगोविंद
Fuge 11 PITIA etc."
It will be seen from the above extracts that this anthology
(पद्यसंग्रह or श्लोकसंग्रह) was compiled by मणिराम for the benefit of his
own son as stated by him in verse 1 at the beginning. I have fail.
ed to get any personal history of this HPOTITA in the body of the
work except the above statenient. The copy before me was made
at Savai Jaipur in Saṁvat 1942 (= A. D. 1886) by a tra lor of
the name Hara Govinda possibly from some old MS of the work
which the owner was not prepared to sell but allowed to be copied
for Sir R. G. Bhandarkar when he carried on his search for MSS in
1884-86.
This big anthology of about 1606 verses mentions as a rule the
names of authors and works from whom the several verses of the
compendium have been incorporated first-hand or otherwise. I
have suggested to my friend Prof. N. A. Gore of the S. P. College
to analyse this big anthology and prepare indices of works and
authors and also of the gains of the verses quoted in it. He has
agreed to this suggestion but before he gives us the results of his
critical analysis I want to record in this paper the evidence about
the chronology of the work which I could gather by a cursory
perusal of the work. I hope this evidence would help Prof. Gore
to determine more exactly my chronology of this work in the light
of his elaborate study of this unique MS.
To enable us to fix the earlier limit for the date of AfOTTTA I
note below the following evidence for the consideration of
scholars :-
(1) APOTTIA (=M) mentions and quotes from franciaofÀN e.g.
Folio 7 - “ À FEAF....EftattiTTU PAYIFT "
Folio 1 –" tariratprafer... faTTITOASTATA"
Folio 4 — “ ar tikt arbete.....80 EPTATITOÀY "
Folio 31—6aut ari ari aftugtat...8& aftaltiTo-
fYTET"
According to Dr. Chaudhuri one partenfis has
been quoted from in the पद्यवेणी of वेणीदत्त (A. D. 1644) as
the author of the following verses :-
P. V. No. 872 — " gjorta ayon"

Page 249****************************************************************************************
STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
P. V. No. 141 -- " भूभृन्मौलि तटीषु......। साहा साहिजहां
ब्रवीमि..."
In view of the reference to Shah Jahan (1628-1658
A. D.) in verse No. 141 above this हरिनारायणमिश्र is con-
temporary of Shah Jahan and I may add that he is con-
temporary of वेणीदत्त also.
If हरिनारायणमिश्र mentioned by M is identical with his
namesake mentioned in the coast we can say that M is
later than c. A. D. 1630.
(2) M mentions भोजप्रबन्ध as follows :-
Folio 48 - "भोज प्रबन्धादेतो" Folio6- "भोजप्रबन्धस्य"
Folio 8 - Do-
Follo 58 - " भोजप्रबन्धात्" Folio 72 - " भोजप्रबन्धात्"
According to Dr. A. B.' Keith (Sans. Lit., 1928, p. 293)
the Bhojaprabandha of degreea belongs to the 16th
Century. We may, therefore, conclude that M is later than
c. A. D. 1550.
(3)
M quotes from and mentions अकबरीय कालिदास e. g. on
folios 4, 6, 10, 11(=P. V. 138), 13, 54 (verses 14 and 19).
These references would make M posterior to Akbar ( A.D.
1542-1605) who patronized अकबरीय कालिदास.
(4) The following verses are quoted by M as his own in his
anthology :-
Folio 6-"टोडरेश यशोभद्या बुद्धदास्तारकबजाः ।
व्योमगंगामृणालीव फेनखण्डोपमो विधुः ॥ ६८॥

Out of the five verses which, M states, are his own composi-
tion four verses are in praise of TESTT TISTHS the finance minister of
Akbar. टोडरमल्ल (A.D. 1535-1589) was a great patron of Sanskrit learn.
ing. Is it possible to suppose that M was patronized by राजा टोडरमल ?
As M has taken special care to compose 4 verses in praise of this
Raja we can easily infer that either M had intense admiration for
टोडरमल्ल as a result of the latter's liberal patronage to M or that M
was not far removed in point of time from टोडरमल्ल so that he could
pay his tribute to SIGTHI's valour, the reputation of which must
have been fresh in the minds of the generations that followed him
say between A. D. 1600 and 1675 and to which M belonged.
(5) M mentions " आंकोल लक्ष्मण" ' on folio 7 and quotes the
following verses as his composition :-
"रघुकुलतिलक कृपाल स्वद्विष क्षोणिपाल
प्रविलसदयकीर्तिश्यामले विश्वजाले।
1. On folio8 I find another verse ascribed to आकोल लक्ष्मण as
follows:-
"देव क्षोणितलाधिप त्वयिमहादानप्रधाने विधी
चेतः कुर्वति यातयत्यपि दृशं स्वर्णादिके वस्तुनि।
विप्राणामतिघोरधारकठिनद्योतत्कुठारोद्यता-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
भगवति भजमाने कृष्णतां शूलपाणी
किमुदधि गिरिपुन्यौ चक्रतुस्समिधातः ॥ ७ ॥
आंकोल लक्ष्मणस्य"
The above verse is anonymously quoted on p. 123 of
सुभापितरत्नभाण्डागार (N. S. Press, Bombay, 1911)as follows:-
" रघुतिलक नृपाल स्वद्विषाक्षोणिपाल
प्रतिलसदपकीर्तिश्यामले विश्वजाले ।
भगवति भजमाने कृष्णतां शलपाणी
किमुदधिगिरिपुख्यौ चक्रतु स्तन विद्मः ॥ १२२॥"
"आंकोल लक्ष्मण" mentioned by M is identical with
"लक्ष्मणभट्ट आकोलकर'' the author of the anthology पद्यरचना
(काव्यमाला 89. N. S. Press, Bombay, 1908.) In my paper on
the date of garaat (Journal of Oriental Research Madras,
Vol. XIV. Pt. III) I have proved that this author flourish-
ed between A. D. 1610 and 1673 as he quotes अकबरीय कालि-
C# on the one hand and is quoted in Haribhāskara Agni-
hotri's पद्यामततरनिणि composed in A. D. 1673. As M
mentions आंकोल लक्ष्मण (Between C. A. D. 1610 and 1673)
we may reasonably infer that M was either a contemporary
of आंकोल लक्ष्मण or that he flourished later than A. D. 1630.
(6) Prof. Gore will of course deal exhaustively with the works
and authors mentioned by M in his anthology. I note
below these works and authors as I noticed them during a
rapid survey of the Ms :-

M has quoted more than 25 verses of graafist in the
present anthology. I have proved in a special paper that
all these verses have been taken by M from the DTTIT-
संजीवनी o हरिदेवमिश्र recently edited by Mr. K. M. K.
Sarma, Curator of the Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner as
Appendix to his edition of अकबरसाही शंगारदर्पण (Ganga
Oriental Series No. 1, 1943). Curiously enough the rare
MS of the forta saat on which Mr. Sarma has based his
edition belonged to traja ATOTIĦ the great scholar at the
court of Maharaja Anup Singhji of Bikaner (A. D. 1669-
1698 ) as the last folio of this MS bears the title of the
work and the Lame of TE AFOTA, as stated by Mr.
Sarma in his Introduction (p. XXVI). I am of opinion
that AfOTTIA, the author of the s ink anthology is identi-
cal with APOTTIR Firea the protège of Maharaja Anup
Singhji. Very probably M used the rare Ms of TT-
संजीवनी for the quotations given by him in his श्लोकसंग्रह.
In view of the evidence recorded above we may easily arrive
at the following conclusions :
(1) The date of the composition of the state of
AFTTTH is definitely later than A. D. 1600.
मणिराम दीक्षित, the owner of the Bikaner MS of the
शृंगारसंजीवनी, is identical with मणिराम, the author of
the link anthology.
If these conclusions are accepted the date of the 4*He lies
between A. D. 1650 and 1700.
I reported my discovery of मणिराम's श्लोकसंग्रह antho.
logy to Mr. K. M. K. Sarma, Curator, Anup Sanskrit
Library, Bikaner, who was kind enough to send me a copy
of his note on ' Tera HITTTA" (Pages 63-64 of Ind. Hist.
Quarterly, XXI, 1947) and some additional information.
While thanking Mr. Suriga for his great interest in my dis.
covery, I note for the information of readers some points

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
from Mr. Sarma's note and correspondence bearing on the
life and works of दीक्षित मणिराम :-
(1) There are many MSS in the Anup Sans. Library

गंगाराम मिश्र
मणिराम (belonging to धर्जटपुर)

अनूपव्यवहारसागर (“ अस्मद् गुरुचरण हरिनारायणमिश्र-

the श्लोकसंग्रह also मणिराम quotes some verses of
हरिनारायणमिश्र.
(4) Works of मणिराम in the Anup Library:-
(i) कात्यायनीतसूत्रभाष्य (No. 706)- At the beginning
the author says that he writes this for the benefit
of his son. At the beginning of the saint also
he makes a similar statement (मणिरामेण विदुषा
स्वसुतस्य हितैषिणा। प्राचीनकृतपद्यानां संग्रहः क्रियते स्वयम् ॥)
(ii) महाभारतसार (Nos. 984-88) signed by मणिराम and
शिवानन्द.
(iii) महाभारतभावदीपसारोद्धार (No. 989) विराटपर्वन् and
(No. 990) उद्योगपर्वन् - This is a gloss of नीलकंठ's
commentary and explains difficult passages here
and there. It is styled परिष्कार also. नीलकंठ चतुर्धर'
1. One हरिनारायण मिश्र composed (1) मधुविध्वंसभास्कर denouncing

to in No. 1.

was patronized by महाराज अनुपसिंह of Bikaner, the
patron of मणिराम. Possibly मणिराम must have
been in contact with नीलकंठ चतुर्धर during Anupa-
simha's Deccan campaigns.
(iv) अष्टादशदिवसयुद्धानि (No. 991)- There is no mention
of the author. Mr. Sarma thinks that this work is
probably a part of मणिराम's महाभारतसार.
(v) अनुपविलास in 7 parts called रत्नs dealing with धर्म-

ten sections called लहरीs - MS dated Samvat 1746

(viii) अनन्तव्रतोद्यापन ( No. 1477).
(5) A MS of the भ्रमरदृत of वाचस्पति भट्टाचार्य bears the signature
of दीक्षित मणिराम along with the following versified
endorsement :-
"रामपत्पङ्कजासक्तचित्तविद्वच्छिरोमणेः ।।
पुस्तं मिश्र मणीरामस्यास्तां ख्यातं महीतले। "
This very endorsement is found on a MS of the com-
mentary प्रकाश on प्रबोधचन्द्रोदय (MS No. 31997). Sometimes
the signature appears as "दो(क्षित) मणिराम" and sometimes
as "दी० मणिराम-शिवानन्द." This शिवानन्द needs to be identi-
fied. On a MS of नलोदय in the Anup Library ( No. 3052)
we find the following verse :-
"रसाश्विसप्तेन्दुमिते च वर्षे वसन्तमासे हि हरेस्थितौ च ।
यं कालिदासोऽपि चकार पूर्व नलोदयाख्यं हि कथानकं च ।
तं मणिरामः शिवानंद त्रिपुरस्य पुरे वसन् ।
लिलेख चैव सर्वेषां लोकानां हितकाम्यया ॥
The chronogram "रसाश्विसप्तेन्दु" = Samvat 1726 =
A. D.1670.
There are many name-sakes' of मणिराम. They should be
distinguished from our मणिराम, the protége of महाराज अनपसिंह of
Bikaner. The relative chronology of the several works of this
मणिराम should be reconstructed on the strength of the dated MSS
of his works in the Anup Library, Bikaner, but I leave this task' to
my friend Mr. K. M. K. Sarma, M. O. L. the present Curator of
this Library and the General Editor of its Ganga Oriental Series. •

(1) In verse 1 of the extract the author bows to god यदुवर (कृष्ण).
(2) In verse 2 it is stated that THAA is the author of this work
called मारुतमण्डन. He was born of a family of Brahmins
of the Bharadvāja Gotra [ भरद्वाजास्वमा is evidently a mis-
reading for भरद्वाजान्वया (ये द्विजाः)]. This family lived at a
place called त्रिशुगपुर (?) situated to the east of वृन्दावन,'
adorned by the temple of गोविंद.
(3) In verse 3 the author bows to god Ganesa (हयकंधर).

1. वनमाली was a champion of Madhva philosophy. As he hailed
from the neighbourhood of Vindāvana, the centre of Krşņa .worship
in the United Provinces, it seems that Madhvaism had spread far and
wide from its original home in South India at the time of Vana-
malin's literary career, say, between A. D. 1575 and 1650.

The foregoing analysis of the MS of Albahan before us
enables us to make the following observations :-
(1) The work #TEAST is avowedly composed in defence of
the Madhva doctrine hy its author TFATTI as expressly
stated in the oft-repeated verse “मंडने मध्वतंत्रस्य etc." on
folios 36, 42, 46, 50, 52.
(2) The later limit to the date of मारुतमंडन is A. D. 1685 in
which year the present MS of this work was copied.
(3) The reference to मनोरमा on folio 57 (No. 31 in the above
list ) needs to be identified. If it is identified with the
प्रोढमनारमा of Bhattoji Diksita ( Between A. D. 1560 and
1620) we may easily fix up वनमालिन् between say A. D. 1600
and 1685.
(4) The न्यायामृत' mentioned on folio 7(No. 25 of the list of
- -- . .- -. ...
Vide p. 172 of Adyar Sanskrit MSS Cata. Part II ( 1928 )-"न्याया-

may be a work of the author of मारुतमण्डन.

ates of the Madhva school; he died in A. D. 1533 (vide p.
759 of Henyoria araz197 by Chitrav Shastri, Poona, 1937).
Prof. B. N. K. Sarma assigns balgate to the period A. D.
1478-1539 (NIA, II, p. 659).
(5) The Farah or Far quoted several times in the work (No.
26 of the list) is possibly identical with the Fire ET (a com-
mentary on the अनुव्याख्यान of आनंदतीर्थ) by जयतार्थ, who
flourished between A. D. 1366 and 1389 (see p. 394 of Hef-
gria afiadrat).
(6) The aripiafort ( No. 21 of the list ) is possibly identical
with the तात्पर्यचन्द्रिका of व्यासतीर्थ which is a commentary on
the तत्वप्रकाशिका of जयतीर्थ. This तत्वप्रकाशिका ( No. 24 of the
list) is a commentary on the ब्रह्मसूत्रभाप्य of आनन्दतीर्थ.
(7) Owing to the loss of the 1st folio of the MS of the ATEN-
Hoza I am unable to say what information it contained
about the author and his work. In my analysis of the MS
I have indicated several verses quoted by Vanamālin
during the course of his polemical discussion. Though
incorrectly written, these verses are good composition but
I cannot say if they are Vanamālin's own composition or
his teacher's. On folios 3 and 4 he refers to his teacher
as "3767151", who needs to be identified. Perhaps the
first folio now missing in our MS may have contained a
relerence to this 371a11.
(8) I have reserved for another paper a study of the other
works of our Vanamālin, some MSS of which have been
traced by me in the Govt. MSS library at the B.O.R. Insti-
tute. In three of these works Vanamālin refers to his
teacher as मरुत् in the expressions “आचार्यान् श्रीमरुन्मुख्यान"
“Hafrath” and “Atja.” Perhaps the name “ ATER-
HºTa ” of the present work may contain a reference to
this teacher #57.
In view of the data collected above I am inclined to assign
TAHTIC, the author of the AICHAPEA, to the period, A.D. 1575-1630.
1. These works are :-(1) Hafefe auga, (2) fafetera 19971
(MS dated A. D. 1692) and (3) Fiat €197.
The 5471914aattegH ( Adyar MS) may be our author's work.
The Adyar MS of the work needs to be examined with a view to
proving this suggestion.

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The above extracts give us the following particulars about the
author and his work :-
(1) The author bows to god नृसिंह, आनंदतीर्थ (= मध्वाचार्य) and
one वनमालिदासगुरु at the beginning of the MS.
(2) In verse 1 he bows to god Ganesa (हयास्य).
(3) In verse 2 he invokes the favour of god मुकुंद.
(4) In verse 3 he bows to his preceptor मरुत् who is called यतिगुरु
and afara cartazut. He also invokes the blessings of guate and
ग्यासतीर्थ. The name of the author is वनमाली.
(5) Verse 5 gives us the title of the work, which is न्यायामृत-
AITA-7.' This title is in agreement with the following verse found
on folio 23 :-
" सामान्यतो हि मिथ्यारवभंजन माथिभंजनं ।
श्रीन्यायामृतसौगन्ध्ये श्राविते वनमालिना॥"
In the margins of folios 2 to 33 the name of the work is re.
corded as "सौग-यं." On folio 33 occurs the endorsement "अद्वत-
सिद्धिखंडन वनमालीमिश्रीय". Perhaps this endorsement is responsible
for the title "अद्वैतसिद्विखंडन' recorded in the catalogue of 1882-83

___ These verses are identical with verses 3 and 4 of the B. O. R.I.
MS No. 668 of 1882-83, which is evidently a MS of न्यायामृतसौगन्ध्य.
Besides the references (on folio 1) to जयतीर्थ, व्यासतीर्थ, मरुदंश गुरु
( author's preceptor ) the work mentions the following authors and
works :-
___1. Aufrecht (CC III, 67) records the following MS of न्यायामृत-
सौगन्ध्य :-"न्यायामृत Vedanta by व्यासतीर्थ-Comm. न्यायामृतसांगन्ध्य by वन-

"Hz 1541” = MS No. 1541 in the list of Sanskrit MSS by Hult-
zsch (Report No. 1. 1895 ). This MS contained only 8 leaves. The
beginning of this MS as given on p. 147 of the Report reads as
follows :
"कृतनिगमविभागं केशवांश मुनीदें। यतिगुरुमरुदंशदेशिकावायवयं

It is clear from the evidence recorded above that the present
MS No. 668 of 1882-83 is a MS of 7771 HaĒTaey (of hafax) of
which two other MSS have been noticed by me in this paper viz.
(1) the MS described by Hultzsch and (2) the MS mentioned in the
Adyar library catalogue. Evidently the title ngarefccisa as
applied to this MS is not correct.
Vanamālin mentions are on folio 81 of the MS. In the
Madhyayugina Caritrakośa (Poona, 1937) p. 753, we are told that
sotaat (died A.D. 1533) had a controversy with TTTST. Accord-
ing to Dr. S. K. De' the date of 497977 is uncertain. According to
Satish Chandra Vidyabhushan (Indian Logic, Calcutta, 1921, pp.
455-56) 9977 belongs to the last quarter of the 13th century (i.e.
Between A. D. 1275 & 1300 ). Gopinath Kaviraj (Sarswati Bhawan
Studies, IV, pp. 62 f.) shifts this date to the "3rd quarter of the 15th
century" (i.e., Between A. D. 1450 and 1475. If this date is correct

it will have to be reconciled with the period (A. D. 1478–1539) to
which guter has been assigned by B. N. Krishnamurti Sarma.'
Gigoitfarma who composed worksin A. D. 1555, 1589 and 1592,
states that he has taken some: passages: from suteater. This fact
harmonises chronologically with the period of: grpater viz. A. D.
1478–1539 fixed up by Dr. B. N. K. Sarma.
The work gangtrefa mentioned on folio 99 by Vanamālin is
possibly a section of the araraaraiderrufa of TEFTTFETTIHTO ( A. D.
1477–1547 ) the great logician of Nudia - p. 676 of Madhyayugina
Caritrakośa.
From the chronology recorded above the present work of
Vanamálin viz. Prota | TEZ is definitely later than A. D. 1550.
This very Vanamālin composed a vigorous defence of the facta in
a work called the ATCH"57 on which I have written a special
paper. The rare MS of this work at the B. O. R. Institute viz.
No. 718 of 1882–83 is dated Samvat 1741 = A. D. 1685. In a verse
at the end of this work the author Vanamálin informs us that he be.
longed to a Brahmin family of the Bharadvāja gotra, living at a
place not far removed from Vịndāvana (in the U. P.). On folio 7 of
the MS of the मारुतमण्डन the author mentions न्यायामृत and on folio
4 he mentions arequialaar. Both these works were composed by
Staatsf (A. D. 1478–1539).
___In view of the above evidence we may assign the न्यायामृतसौगन्ध्य
of Vanamálin to the period A.D. 1575-1650. This Vanamālin appears
to have composed strategiagiigaar ( B. O. R. I. MS dated A. D.
1692) and a commentary on the भगवद्गीता, not to say भक्तिरस्नाकर, a
MS of which has been described by Hultzsch in his Report I, pp.
56 and 129 (extract). All these three works need to be studied
separately with a view to collecting data bearing on the personality
of the author and his literary career. Besides the five works of
our Vanamálin viz. (1) aztarna ITF2, (2) ATOCAUE, (3) prarasta-
tigrast, (4) Haarfar stant and (5) eart there may be many more,
which can be proved to be the works of this author. Aufrecht re-

cords several authors of the name waardes separately, with a work
or two to the credit of each. We must, therefore, examine each
of these works and prove its authorship on the strength of internal
and external evidence. In the present paper I have only examin-
ed the so-called MS of the sigarcasa in the Govt. MSS library
at the B. O, R. Institute and proved it to be identical with TOTA-
Ärtzea of Vanamālin, represented by at least two other MSS

32. Vidyāvilāsa, a Commentary on the
Siddhānta-Kaumudi by Śivarāma Tripāțhin
--- Between A. D. 1700 and 1775 *
Aufrecht' records many commentaries on Siddhanta-Kaumudi
of Bhattoji Dikşita (c. A. D. 1560-1620). Among these com-
mentaries no mention is made of a commentary called Vidya-
viläsa by Sivarama, a MS of which is available in the collection of
the Sanskrit Pathashala at Rajapur in the Ratnagiri District of the
Bombay Presidency. I propose in this paper to examine this MS
made available to me by my learned friend Shri Raghunatha Sastri
Patankar of Rajapur.
About Vidyāvilāsa Aufrecht makes the following entry :-
CC I, 575 — "farenasta by Sivarāma. Mentioned by him in
his Lakşminicāsābhidhāna L. 723."2
CC III, 121 — "fautiame by Sivarāma, See Kaumudi-Vidya-
vilāsa.''
CC III, 28 — "genaurace" or laurrera, gr. by Sivarāma,
As, p. 51."
It appears that the work on grammar of the name "कौमुदीविद्या-
विलास" or विद्याविलास by शिवराम mentioned by Aufrecht is identical
with the fagfare commentary by fatih on the Siddhanta-
Kaumudi represented by the Rajapur MS before me. I am un.

The Rajapur MS of Vidyavilása consists of 17 folios (size :-
94 inches ~ 34 inches ; about 7 lines on each page, each line con-

As Sivarāma mentions Nāgesa (or Nāgojibhațţa) and his works
in his Vidyāvilāsa commentary on the Siddhanta-Kaumudi of
Bhattoji Dikşita he is chronologically later than Nāgesa, who is
assigned to the period A. D. 1700-1750 by Shri Chitrav Shastri.'
The identity of Sivarāma, the author of Vidyāviläsa represent-
ed by the Rajpur MS before me, with Sivarāma, the author of
the Sanskrit vocabulary Lakşminivasábhidhāna (MS described by
Rajendralal Mitra in his Notices, Vol. II, pp. 136-137) is cleary
proved by the following evidence :--
(1) Stangas 8 and 9 which refer to the author's works in the

with Stanzas 31 and 32 in the colophon of Lakşminivasa-
bhidhana (MS described by R. Mitra).
(2) Sivarama is the name of the author of the Vidyāviläsa as
also that of the vocabulary Lakşminivasábhidhāna.
(3) The work in TarasTF" or "father" on grammar
mentioned by Aufrecht (CC III, 28 ) is identical with
विद्याविलास commentary on the सिद्धांतकामुदी (represented by
the Rajapur MS). In fact the Rajapur MS (Stanza 7) refers
to the author शिवराम and his "कौमुदीविद्याविलास" in the
following line :-
"Entladia: gal TITATTĀTha: 1"
Sivarāma, the author of Vidyavilāsa commentary, is better
known as Sivarāma Tripathin. Aufrecht makes the following entry
in his Catalogus Catalogourm about his works :-
CC I, p. 652 — "FTTTT# falsa elder brother of Govinda-
rāma, Mukundarāma, and Keśzvarāma, son of Krşņa-
rāma, grandson of Trilokacandra. He quotes the

to place him in the beginning of the 18th Century.

some points from these remarks :--

In view of the evidence recorded in this paper it is clear that

Aufrecht has not identified either "सीतारामचंद्र बहादुर or विश्वनाथ-
सिंहदेव." I shall, therefore, try to examine Aufrecht's entries and
try to identify these persons.
__In June 1945:Dr. C. K. Raja of the Madras University gave
me an extract' from the MS of संगीतरत्नाकरव्याख्या called संगीतसेतु
available in the Alwar Darbar Library (No. 4628-33). Dr. Raja
asked me to study this extract and fix the date of the author and
his patron.
The extract from the Alwar MS of the itaang supplied by
Dr. Raja gives us the following points for verification :-
(1) The author of the work was one गंगाराम, son of तुलाराम of
माथुरकुल,
1. This extract reads as follows :-

(2) The patron of our author was King fararthaare or fargaret.
for a who was a lover of music.
(3) विश्वनाथसिंहदेव is described in the colophon as “महाराजा-
धिराज" and " श्रीराजाबहादूर." He is further described by
the epithet "सीतारामचन्द्रकृपापात्राधिकारी", which suggests
that he was a devotee of god सीतारामचन्द्र. सीता is referred
to in verse 1 of the extract as "garet” and
"FACETAFI."
(4) The work ofiaaa was composed in 2017 by our author
by the order of facarerranea as stated in verse 3 at the
beginning.
(5) In verse 3 at the beginning of the work our author makes
a respectful reference to one hacia who needs to be
identified.
Before proceeding to record evidence on the points mentioned
above let us see if we can trace any other MS of the pintade of
TOTTIĦ in our published catalogues of MSS. Fortunately for us
there is a complete MS of this work in the Sarasvati Mahal Library
at Tanjore. In the description of this MS the editor of the
Tanjore MSS Catalogue observes as follows :-
"Sangītaratnā karavyākhyā-Setu – A Hindi Commentary.
Though the text of Sārågadeva is published this Commentary is
not published. As this author says this work is written in Vraja-
bhāṣā or a north Indian Dialect. This commentary is called Sangita-
setu and as the author says, is written at the bidding of a prince
called Visvanathasimha Sudeva. He mentions his father's name as
one Tulārām belonging to a family residing in Muttra. The MS in
this library represents the commentary on all the seven chapters.”
( The entire commentary is represented by MSS Nos. 10754 to 10782

p. 41 of Notices, Calcutta, 1871, Vol. I) – A romance on the life of
Rama and his consort Sita, by Visvanāthasimha-folios 43 -
Country paper-MS belongs to Babu Hariscandra of Benares.
The MS begins :- "शक्तिर्येषा न पुंसां भवति न कविता लोकशास्त्रायवेक्षा।
नैपुण्यं चैव नैवाम्यसनमपि तथा शिक्षया काव्य.
गानाम् । काव्य कुर्वान्त तेऽपि प्रभुरगुणयुतं यस्कृपातो
लभन्ते । प्रेमाणं चालभ्यं तदवनितनयापादपत्रं

The MS ends :- “विश्वनाथानुभतोदितं ध्यानं हान्त भवबन्धजालं। इति
श्रीमहाराजाधिराज श्रीराजबहादूरसीताराम-
चन्द्रकृपापाचाधिकारी विश्वनाथसिंहभूदेवविर-

The above extract clearly proves the identity of the author
of this Sanskrit work with his name-sake mentioned in
the Hindi work viz. the intadt already described by
me on the strength of the extracts from the Alwar and
Tanjore MSS of this work. This Sanskrit work
रामचंद्रान्हिक with commentary gives us the following
particulars :-
(i) Its author is King विश्वनाथसिंहदेव,
(ii) In the colophon he is called "महाराजाधिराज", "राज-
बहादर" and "सीतारामचंद्र कृपापात्राधिकारी." These epi-
thets are invariably mentioned in the colophons of
the MSS of the Hindi works of our author like the
संगीतसेतु and others.
(2) सर्वसिद्धांत -A MS of this Sanskrit work is described by
Mitra in his Notices, Vol. VII, Calcutta, 1884, Pp. 99-100-No.
2329, folios 85, Extent 3300 slokas. This work is described as
"an essay on the divinity of Rāmacandra and the truth of the dual
theory of the elder Vedānta. By Raja Kumāra Vidvanāthasimha."
The MS begins :-
" सान्द्रानन्दसुधा-बुधेरुदयभूः सत्यप्रतिज्ञावशी। प्रायेशाप्रतिपादकोपनिषदा

We get the following information from the above extracts :-
(1) The author of this work was विश्वनाथसिंहदेव who is called
"श्रीमहाराजकुमार" and not “महाराजाधिराज'' as in the राम-
चन्द्रचम्पू and Gangarama's संगीत( रत्नाकर )सेतु. It appears,
therefore, that the paragia was composed by our
author before his coming to the gådi.
(ii) The guru of our author was one प्रियादास (प्रियादासगुरु.
चरणा:). The guruparamparā begins with one चंद्रलाल
and ends with प्रियादास.
(iii) When विश्वनाथसिंहदेव was a महाराजकुमार there seems to
have been a minister of the name gera mentioned
as "अमात्यश्रीभोदूलाल" at the bginning of the work.

SANSKRIT AND HINDI WORKS OF VISVANITHADINHA
(iv) One furtararei is mentioned in the colophon. We
must see if this person is imaginary or historical.
From the data so far recorded it is clear that our author was
interested in FTHET and that by his order and under his patronage
Gangarama composed the संगीतसेतु in व्रजभाषा. प्रियादास mentioned
by Gangārāma with respect is evidently identical with faigie the
guru of Gangārāma's patron forzarea. The spiritual genealogy
of this guru has also been recorded by this author in his Sanskrit
work palestra composed by him when he was an heir-apparent,
महाराजकुमार.
In view of our author's interest in HTT we must see what
works in this language were composed by him. In my search for
these works, I have found the following Hindi works in the cata-
logues of Hindi MSS available to me :--
(1) Rai Bahadur Hiralal in his Report on the Search of Hindi
MSS, Allahabad, 1929, makes the following remarks on "Visva-
nátha Simha" :-
P. 117 - "203. Visvanatha Simha Mahārājā of Rewah, who
ascended the throne in 1835 A. D. has written many
books of which Parama Tatva Prakāśa (a work on
yoga and devotion) and Rägasāgara on music have
been found in the present search in the Fatehpur dis-
trict. The first MS is dated 1837 A. D. which ap-
pears to be the date of its composition. The second
has no date. Visvanātha Simha' was a poet of
eminence."
P. 488 - MS No. 205 (a)-That798147 by Viśvanātha Simhaji,
leaves 15, 64 ślokas — Date of composition :-
Samvat 1892 (= A. D. 1835). MS ends :-"gfa SAETTTETETTHE
श्रीराजाबहादुर सितारामचन्द्र क्रपातत्राधिकार विश्वनाथसिंह जू देवकृत
qaragara ÁY BATA etc.”
In the beginning our author refers to his guruप्रियादास :- "जय
गनेश हरिगुरु प्रियादास चरण धरि सीस ॥"
1. विश्वनाथसिंह the Maharaja of Rewa should not be confounded
with fa 2777727, a Bhāț of Biswan (Dist. Sitapur) wło composed 3744171-
दरस in A. D. 1815 for one जालिमसिंह and another work अलंकारदपन in

voluminous authors and 10 of his works have been noticed,
only two of which appear to have been known before. I
may add that his son and successor Mahārājā Raghuraja
Singha (1854-80) is alone a well-known and voluminous
author.'

Bhagavata and probably he rendered that book into the
Bundelakhandi dialect as mentioned by Ward (View of the
History of the Hindus, Vol, II, p. 481) but he cannot be
the same Priyā Dās (1712 A. D.) who wrote the well-known
gloss on the Bhaktanāmävali of Nābhā Dās, as the time of
Priyā Dās alias Krşņa Datta must be fixed in the first half
of the 19th Century, when Maharaja Viśvanātha Singha, his
disciple flourished at Rewāh. The author of this MS is
one Droņācārya Tiwādi, who was a disciple of Priyā Dās

are not many. - It is, however, clear from my account that
Maharaja Viśvanātha Simba was a highly religious per-
sonage:with voluminous literary work to his credit.
My friend the: late Diwan Bahadur Janaki Prasad of Rewa,
whose contact with me for a few years prior to his sad demise
created in me a strong desire to study the cultural and literary
history of Baghel Khanda, had sent to me all typewritten copy of
his History of the Rewah State. In this copy I find the following
remarks about Maharaja Viśvanātha Simha :
ture and parent success. Like hiable ruler
"Maharaja Jai Singh Deva abdicated in favour of his son
Maharaja Kumar Vishwanatha Singh ( afterwards Maharaja Vishwa-
natha Singh) in 1813 and from this time onward Vishwanatha Singh
controlled the administration of the state until his father's death
in 1833. Jaisingh was a good scholar and author of several works
as well as a patron of learning. He was married at Manda and at
Gauria. He had three sons: (1) Vishwanatha Singh, who as
already stated succeeded him. (2) Lakshman Singh who was
granted the chaurasi Madhogarh and (3) Balbhadra Singh of
Amarpatan..............
30. Vishwanatha Singh ( A.D. 1833-1854) – We have seen that
Vishwanatha Singha was administering the state for 20 years before
his accession to the Gādi. He was a very able ruler and adminis-
tered the state with great success. Like his father he was a lover
of literature and patron of learning. Misunderstanding arose
between Maharaja Vishwanath Singh and the heir - apparent.
Some of the Sardars of the state endeavoured to create mis.
understanding between Maharaja Vishwanatha Singh and the Yuva-
rāja Maharaja Kumar afterwards Maharaja Raghuraja Singha.
They partially succeeded in doing so and the result might have
been disastrous to the state but for the foresightedness and saga-
city of Maharaja Vishwanatha Singh and good sense and filial love
of Raghuraja Singh ............ (Some Sardars were expelled from
the state )...... these Sardars went to Lahore and were in the service
of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the “ Lion of the Punjab.” They were
called back to Rewa some years afterwards at the suggestion of
Sir Henry Hardinge, the Governor General.
Raghuraja Singh was born in 1823. Maharaja Vishwanath
Singh delegated most of his powers to Raghuraja Singh in 1842
when the Yuvaraja was in his 19th year..........
Maharaja Vishwanatha Singh on the delegation of powers to
him by his father made Pande Bhondu Lal his Diwan...........

Vishwanatha Singh had only one son and three daughters. He
had five Mahārāņis......Raghuraja Singh (A. D. 1854–1880 ). Born in
1823. He ascended the Rewa Gādi in 1854 and died in February
1880. Like his father and grand-father he was a patron of learning
and was a Hindi poet of no mean order. He was Sanskrit Scholar
and knew English”.
I believe, the above remarks of Diwan Bahadur Janaki Prasad
give us the cultural background of the several Sanskrit and Hindi
works of Maharaja Vishwanatha Singh of Rewah. It is also note-
worthy that three Rewa Maharajas in succession viz. Jai Singh,
Vishwanatha Singh and Raghuraja Singh were not only patrons of
learning but were men of high literary attainments and capable
administrators.

34. Visvanātha Mahadeva Ränade, a Citta-
pāvan Court-poet of Raja Ramsing 1 of
Jaipur and his works –
Between A. D. 1650 and 1700 *
In the Gotrāvali of the Chitpāvan Brahmins of the Maha-
rashtra we find the surname Ränade. The gotra of the Rānađe
family is Bhäradvaja. There are at present numerous Ränade
families in the Maharashtra. Some of the members of these
families are highly educated and well-placed in life. During the
last 100 years the Rānades have produced some men' of literary
pursuits but it is not known if any such men were produced by
this family before A. D. 1880. It is, therefore, worth while in-
vestigating and putting on record whatever information we can
discover from authentic records about the literary men belonging
to the Ränade family preferably before A. D. 1880.
As I have no early genealogies of the Rânades with me, I shall
satisfy myself by recording here a usage of the surname 'Ränade'
which I found in a document of A. D. 1660 while studying some
documents of my own family: between A. D. 1633 and 1685. This

1. The late Justice Madhava Govind Ranade stands at the top of
such men. His versatile intellect, patriotism, and sterling character
as also other qualities of head and heart have already won for him an
immortal fame in the history of Maharashtra. Among living members
of the Rânade families mention may be made of Prof. R. D. Ranade,
now head of the Philosophy Department of the Allahabad University,
the author of some standard works on philosophy such as Construc-
tive Survey of the Upanishadic Philosophy,' 'Mysticism in Maha-
räshsra,' etc. In the field of Marathi literature I may mention here
my friend Prof. S. B. Ranade, now Professor in the Ismail College,
Andheri, who has already made a mark in the field of Marathi Poetry
by the publication of his numerous poems during the last 30 years or 60.
2. No family history of the Rānades has so far been published.
It is time that some one attempts such history.

document is a sale-deed of property by one Rogbhat bin Gopala
bhag Ränadiyā in favour of Jān Thākur bin Rām Thākur. Evidently
Rogbhat Rānadīyā was living in A. D. 1600 when he sold a
property to Jān Thākur of Jamasade near Devagad. Gopālabhat,
the father of Rogbhat, was a contemporary of Rām Thākur about
A. D. 1633, which is the date of the earliest sale deed of property
purchased by Rām Thākur. It is clear from this contemporary
document that one Ränade family was resident near Devagad in
the Ratnagiri District of the Bombay Presidency. Like many
other Chit pāvan Brahmins the Rānades must have migrated from

1938, where I have recorded the lates of sale-deeds of properties
purchased by my ancestors, viz. the Thakurs of Jamsade (near Deva-
gad in the Ratnagiri District of the Bombay Presidency.
1. Compare the following account of a Chittapāvana going to
Bengal (between A. D. 1660 and 1690) from Konkon for attaining
siddhi under the guidance of a tāntric teacher of Rādha :-
In the Fragments of Poems pertaining to the Maratha King
Sambhaji ( A. D. 1680-1689) published by me in the Annals (B. O.
R. I.), Vol. XIX, Part I (1938), pp. 49–60, we find the description of a
force of ITET in Bengal (pp. 57-58 - verses I to 32). A Chitta pāvana
Brahmin called Frami from Konkon went to this free and became
his pupil :-
" शिवयोगी नाम कश्चिद्ब्राह्मणश्चित्तपावनः ।
निशम्य तस्य सिद्धस्य चरितं परमाद्भुतम् ॥३३ ।।
हित्वा कोंकणकं देशं तं देश समुपाश्रितः।
eraarg i F ATTTATA gata: 11 3811"
This चित्तपावन Brahmin served the सिद्ध of राढा devotedly and in
course of time attained सिद्धि:-.
"प्रगल्भोदारसेवाभिराराध्य गुरुमादरात् ।
अलभच्छिवयोगी सः सिद्धिकामीप सुव्रतः॥५॥"
He then returned to stregt near Sangameshvar in the Ratnagiri
District of the Bombay Presidency and founded there a HOT or
hermitage :-
"पश्यनक्षेत्राणि नानारसभरभरितः पर्यटन्तीर्थपतीः ।
प्रेम्णा शृंगारपुर्या व्यरचदथ मठी कोंकणे करदेशे

Bengal from Konkon is correct, we have in it a parallel to the case of

Konkon to Poona and other places above the Ghāts during the
Peshwa period of Maratha history, when the rule of the Chit-
pāvans, i.e. the Peshwas attracted many Brahmins to their capital
Poona, which then provided prospects to many ambitious youths.
As I have not studied all the records of the Maratha history per.
taining to this period I am unable to say whether any member of
the Rânațe family made his home in Poona and took to any
political or literary pursuits.
The study of family history will he greatly facilitated if a
dictionary of surnames current in Maharashtra is compiled. Such
a dictionary should record the usage of every surname in a
definitely dated document so that we can have before us under each
surname dated usages of that surname from the earliest to the
latest with indication of the source for each usage recorded. In the
case of the surname Ränade we have no means of determining the
geography' of the residence of the Rānades and their migration

another चित्तपावन, viz. विश्वनाथ रानडे, going to Benares and becoming a
pupil of Kamalākara anb Dhundirāja. As the 1979197 ferair is
shown as contemporary of King Sambhaji ( A.D.1680-1689), he appears
to have been a contemporary of 1a 27.714 tras who composed his ITT-

from the earliest home to other parts of the Maharashtra or out-
side. The study of surn:mes is further rendered difficult by the
Carly Maratha practice of using only the name of the person and
his father without the use of the surname, unlike the present
practice of using the names of the person and his father together
with his surname in each case.
In spite of the tendency to omit surnames we often find the
mention of the surname or Upanāma in some late Sanskrit works
of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. In accordance
with this tendency, which finally became universal in the nine.
teenth century, we find the surname Ränade mentioned by a
writer of the seventeenth century in his two rare works, each of
which is represented by a single MS only. I shall now record
whatever information can be gathered from these two MSS about
the personal history of this member of the Ränade family belong-
ing to the Shivaji period of the Maratha history and then link it
up with other contemporary history as far as possible.
Aufrecht makes the following entries about an author fasurare

CC 1,661 -'mitati, nātaka by Viśvanātha, 10. 274. '

son of Haribhatta :
Srngäravāpikā nāļikā. He wrote this play by
desire of King Rāmasinha, son of Jayasinha.''
( Continued from the previous page )
Amritrao, the grandfather of Justice M. G. Ranade, had much inte
rest in Sanskrit learning. He prepared copies of several MSS for his
own study. In 1925 the B. O. R. Institute acquired a small collection
of MSS from Dr. N. M. Ranade, the son of Justice Ranade. This col-
lection belonged to his father. It is possible to infer that some of
these MSS may have been collected by Amritrao Ranade.
1. Vide p. 783 of Madhyayugina Caritrakośa by S. Chitrav,
Poona, 1937 - "fà 479TY HZ ( about A. D. 1650 ), author of the drama
gintzailm. He was son of Mahadeva and pupil of Dhundirāja. He
was a Chittapāvana Brahmin, possibly with the surname “ Rånade."
He wrote the drama by 'order of Rāmasinha."
It appears from the above remarks that the work of Ta, com.
posed by for THE 1778, is not known to the M. Caritrakosa.

The identity of gfostra, the guru of facraru HE (Ranade), with

"ध्यारवा मानसपूजनं च विधिवत्कृत्वा कविर्ताक्षण:
श्लोकाविश्वगुरोः पुरोऽपठदिमाम्श्रीविश्वनाथो निजान् ।"
Canto I consists of 40 stanzas, II of 80 stanzas, and III of 14
stanzas. At the end of Canto II the following date of copy is
recorded :
"संवत् १७७६ माघ-शुदि-त्रयोदशी भौमवासरे लि० ॥ उद्धवजी नागेश।"
The MS ends as follows:
“इति श्रीचित्तपावनजातीय रानडोपनामक कविश्रीविश्वनाथकृते श्रीशंभु.
विलास शेषनाम चाव्ये [.विलासारये काव्ये I, II.] तृतीयः सर्गः।"
It is clear from the above lines that fazaar was a Chitta-
pāvan Brahmin of the surname 717 who had migrated to Benares
for spiritual reasons (ब्रह्म हृदि स्मरन् ) after having realized the
futility of existence (ज्ञात्वा प्रपंचं मृपा). These reasons are stated
by him in verse 14 of Canto III which precedes the above colo-
phon and reads as follows:
" भुक्त्वा वैपयिकं सुखं कविरसौ स जातबोधस्ततो
दृश्यं स्थावरजंगमात्क( ०त्मक)मिदं ज्ञात्वा प्रपंचं मृपा ।
सर्वानंदगृहं परात्परतरं श्रीराजराजेश्वरी-

Dr. Eggeling has devoted three pagess to the description of
1. This date corresponds to 11th February, 1720, which is a
Thursday according to Ephemeris (vide 'Indian Ephemeris, Vol. VI,
p. 242).
2. In a work called the अद्वैतसुधा (B. O. R. I. MS No. 143 of
1902-07), composed by लक्ष्मणपंडित in A. D. 1662, he states that he
migrated to Benares from Maharashtra for spiritual reasons after
abandoning all his belongings (दक्षिण दिश्यपास्य श्रियः काश्यामुदासीनमति,
etc.). Lakşmaņabh atta appears to have been a contemporary of
Viśvanāthabhațța Ränade and went to Benares for reasons identical
with those mentioned by Visvanáthabhatta in verse 14 of Canto III of
the Sambhuvilasa. Laksmana had two preceptors, (1) रामाश्रम and
(2) उत्तमश्लोक, like Visvanātha's two gurus: (1) कमलाकर and (2) धुण्डिराज.

the only MS of Vibyanātha's Śrngäravăţikā. His description
pertaining to the author and the subject of the drama is as
follows:
'Syngäraväţika ( or Śrrgåravāpikà as it is frequently called in
the MS), a play (natikā ), in four acts by विश्वनाथभट्ट कवि (pupil of
धुण्डिराज), son of महादेवभट्ट सूरि, grandson of विष्णुभट्ट कोविद, and
great-grandson of हरिभट्ट पंडित of the चित्तपावन family. The subject of
the play is the love of the young King of Avanti ad and
कान्तिमती daughter of King रत्नपाल of चंपावती."
In the following verse at the commencement of the play the
author bows to this guru Dhundirāja :-
" यच्छिप्य रचिता जयंति जगति ग्रंथा हि ते यान् क्षणं
दृष्ट्वा मस्तकपूर्णनं वितनुते वागीश्वरोऽपि स्वयं ।
तस्मै वैदिकतांत्रिकाध्वरविद श्रीदुंढिराजाय मे
विश्वेऽस्मिन् स्थिरकीर्तयेऽस्ति गुरवे सद्बुद्धिदात्रे नमः ॥ १ ॥"
Evidently Dhundirāja had a large followinig of pupils includ.
ing our Chittapāvan author. These pupils had composed some
works of value, being inspired to do so by their illustrious guru
who is called by the epithet 'वैदिकतांत्रिकाध्वरविद्.'
After the above salutation to the guru the Sūtradhāra intro-
duces the author of the play in a long passage which states that
the play was written by the order of 'महाराजाधिराज-श्रीरामसिंह-
महीपाल' and then gives us some deatails about the author's
pedigree as follows :-
हरिभट्ट (पंडित) of 'चित्तपावन जाती'
Son
विष्णुभट्ट ( कोविद)
Son
महादेवभट्ट (सूरि)
Son
विश्वनाथ (कवि), author of शंगारवापिका

written in a large clear hand, about 1650 A. D.; eight lines in
a page. Foll. 27-42 in a smaller slanting hand in 1706 A. D.;
twelve lines in a page.'

The introductory passage' referred to above calls forgarar of
as 'कमलाकरांतेवासि', i.c. pupil of कमलाकर. We have already
referred to another guru of our author, viz. दुनिराज. I believe that
कमलाकर, mentioned by our author is identical with कमलाकरमह, the
author of Nirnayasindhu, composed in A. D. 1612, and whose
literary activity is assigned by scholars to the period between A.D.
1610 and A. D. 1640.
The Sotradhara next makes a reference to कुमार विष्णुसिंह for
whose entertainment रामसिंह महीपाल had ordered the performance
of this drama :-
___"भायें विष्णुसिंह कुमारं पुरस्कृत्य शंगारवापिकाभिनयप्रदर्शनार्थ श्रीराम-
सिंहमहीपालेनाशप्ताऽस्मि ।"
The play may have been meant not only for prince 'facufare
but for other associate princes as well, as will be seen from the
following words of the Sūtradhāra :
"अचासौ बहुमोदतां कविरमी शृंगारवापी यथा
गाहंता नृपसूनवः' सुखवशादात्रिर्बजेस्सूक्ष्मता ।"

We are further given by the Satradhāra the genealogy of Raja

of the idolatrous princes, who was then in the empire of the Great
Mogul.' Tavernier 'saw the children of this Prince ( Jaising) who
were being educated there and had as teachers several Brahmins who
taught them to read and write in a language which is reserved to the
priests of the idols and is very different from that spoken by the
people.' 'Having entered the court of this college being curious to
sce it and throwing my eyes upwards, I perceived a double gallery
which ran all round it, and in the lower one these two princes were
seated accompanied by many young nobles and numerous Brahmins
who were making different figures like those of mathematics on the
ground with chalk. As soon as I entered these princes sent to in.
quire who I was, and having learnt that I was a Frenchman they
invited me to ascend, when they asked me many things about Europe
and especially about France. One of the Brahmins had two globes,
which the Dutch had given him and I pointed out the position of
France upon them. After some conversation of this kind they prese-
nted me with betel, etc.'
[ The two princes whom Tavernier met are evidently Ramsing
and Kiratsing, the sons of Jaising I. It is possible to suppose that
Visvanatha Rånade may have been one of the Brahmins who educat.
ed Ramsing and his brother at the Benares College and later after
A. D. 1667, when Ramsing came to the throne, Viśvanātha was asked
to compose a drama for Ramsing's son, Vişnusimha or Bhishansing 1.

Jaipur kings as we find it recorded in the current reference books.'
As regards the date of composition of the Srrigaravāpikā I
have to point out that it must have been composed after the
succession of Rāmsing to the throne of Jaipur as it appears to
refer to this succession in the following line :-

Secondly, it refers to arrangerare' who was obviously the
heir apparant to the throne and for whose entertainment this play
was composed by Viśvanātha by the order of Rämsing, who is
called by the title 'HETTIETETTIST' as already noted above. In the
following verse we are told that Rāmsing was served by other
Rajput princes like Arjuna ( Simha ?), Hindu Simha, Hari Simha
Rāvala, Jayat Simha, etc :-

Students of the history of the Jaipur State will be able to
identify the Rajput names mentioned in the above verse.
The later limit to the date of Śrngāravāpikā would be about
A. D. 1675 because Rāmsing died about this time. It appears,

death of his father Mirza Raja Jaising in the month of July 1667 at
Burhanpur ( vide p. 112 of Chronology of India by Burgess, 1913).
Ramsing was ordered to Gawa hatti in Assam where he remained
till 1675.
Ramsing is supposed to have had a hand in Shivaji's escape from
Agra in A. D. 1666 (p. 111 ).
1. The Iśvaravilāsakāvya (MS No. 273 of 1884-86 -- B. 0. R.
Institute) gives the genealogy of the Jaipur kings in the first canto.
According to this genealogy two princes are mentioned after रामसिंह.
They are (1) कृष्णसिंह and (2) विष्णुसिंह. The interest of विष्णुसिंह in poetry
and music is testified by the following verse on folio 6 of Iśvara.

therefore, that Viśvanāthabhatta Ränade composed his drama
Srågåravä pikå between A. D. 1667 and 1675.'
The surname : Ränade of Visvanātha as also his caste-name
forrerant is clearly mentioned by him in the body of the text of the
drama Srngäraväpikä towards the close of the work which reads
as follows :-
" यो जात्या खलु चित्तपावन इति ख्यातस्तथोपाख्यया
__विल्यातो भुवि रानडा इति जडाज्ञानापहानी कृती।

The above MS of this drama, dated A. D. 1707, is the earliest
dated MS of the work. Whether Visvanātha composed any other
works I cannot say at present. It is for the present Ränade
families to see if they can identify Viſvanātha and his three
ancestors, whose names he has recorded in the drama before us.
It is also a matter for investigation whether Visvanātha had any sons
and whether his descendant is represented in the living Rānade
families in the Maharashtra or outside. I have pointed out earlier
in this paper a Rānade family residing near Devagad in the Ratna.
giri District of the Bombay presidency. It is not improbable that
Visvanātha's ancestors, viz. father asiaa, grandfather face and
great-grandfather gre had their home in the Ratnagiri District and
may have been connected with the contemporary Rânade family
residing near Devagad between A. D. 1609 and 1675.
and who, a matter names han ident;
1. Vide p. 110 of Beale's Dictionary of Ori. Biography - Bishan
Singh ( = favortat mentioned as #17 by Visvanatha) was the son of
Ramsing and father of Sewai Jaising. Bishun Singh died about the
year A. D. 1693 (A. H. 1105)
From the Hindi MSS Report (for 1909–1911), Allahabad, 1914,
pp. 16-17, we learn that Kulapati Miśra composed his 510749 HTUT or a
metrical version of the Dronaparvan of the Mahabharata in A.D. 1676
under the patronage of Ramsing of Jaipur. In the Beale's Dictionary
of Ori. Biography (p. 328) we are told that Ramsing died about A. D.
1675. This date conflicts with the date of composition of Kulapati
Misra's work composed under Rämsing's patronage,

A court-poet of Sevai Jaising, who had close knowledge of the
ancestry of Jaipur princes, has given us a fine description of
Ramsing's interest in literature. This poet is Krşņa Kavi who
in his Isvarvilāsakāvya (composed about A. D. 1744) refers to
Ramsing I as follows:-

I shall now record the chronology of Visvanātha Mahādeva
1. सेवा and सुंभा in verse 40 are Shivaji and Sambhaji
respectively. Rämsing had a hand in their escape from Agra. After
Jaising's death in A. D. 1667 Ramsing was made governor of Assam
(verse 41). Rämsing's love of literature is described in verse 42. It
was this love of नाटकs and प्रहसनs that evidently encouraged विश्वनाथ
रानडे to compose शृंगारवापिका.

Rānade, his contemporaries and predecessors as far as could be
reconstructed from the data recorded in this paper :-
A. D.
1600 ... The great-grandfather of Viśvanātha (=VMR)
probably lived at this time. His name was EITHE as
recorded by VMR.
1612 ... Kamalākarabhatța composed his Nirnayasindhu.
VMR is called the pupil of Kamalakara
(1731 straatori).
1625 ... faroghe, the grandfather of VMR was possibly living
at this time.
1633 ... One Gopālabhațța Rânade was living at Jamasade near
Devagad in the Ratnagiri District of the Bombay
Presidency. He was contemporary of Vişnubhatta
Rānade, the grandfather of VMR.
1610–1640 Period of the literary activity of Kamalakara, the
author of Nirnayasindhu.
c. 1640 ... Probable time of the contact of VMR with his guru
Kamlākara at Benares.
1660 . One Rogbhat Ränade living near Devagad
(Ratnagiri District ).
1666 ... Tavernier meets the two sons of Mirza Raja Jaising
at a Benares College. One of them was Rāmsing.
1667 ... Death of Mirza Raja Jaysing, the father of VMR's
patron Rāmsing.
1667 ... Rāmsing came to the throne of Jaipur. He had a
hand in Shivaji's escape from Agra in A. D. 1666.
c. 1675-76 Death of Rāmsing according to some sources.
1667--1683' Contact of VMR with Raja Rāmsing and composition
of Srrgåravăţikā for Prince Vişnusimha.
1. After this paper was drafted I had occasion to read Roa
Bahadur G. S. Sardesai's paper in the P. V. Kane Volume (1941) on
"An Unkown but Daring Project of King Sambhaji,'' pp. 390-394.
This paper refers to two Sanskrit letters of Sambhaji to Raja Rāmsing
of Jaipur addressed in A. D. 1683. One of these letters is dated
6. 1682. This date clearly shows that Rämsing did not die c. 1675.

as stated in Oriental Biographical Dictionary (p. 328) but that he was
living in A. D. 1682. Viśvanātha Ränade mentions FATT favorite and
also states that he composed his work for this prince by order of
Rämsing. Rao Bahadur Sardesai says (in his footnote on p. 391 of
his paper) that Krishna Singh or Kisan Singh was the only son of
Rämsing. This son was put to death at about the age of 19 near
Parenda on 18th April, 1682, by Aurangzeb for complicity with his
rebel son Akbar. Sambhaji mentions 'FHTC Ehsurfar' in his letter to
Rámsing referred to above. He also mentions 'TTET grafha' who rose
against Aurangzeb and was later killed in a fight. Viſvanātha Ränade
also mentions '31 19 fegre. Is he identical with 'ETET HATAT'?
Without a reliable history of Jaipur, based on contemporary sources,
I find it difficult to deal with these names.

Ratnākarabhațța, the Guru of
Sevai Jaising of Amber *
I have reconstructed elsewhere the genealogy of Ratnākara-
bhațța, the author of the celebrated work on Dharmaśāstra called
the Jayasimhakalpadruma. In this genealogy occurs the name of
Prabhākarabhattı who was the brother of Ratnākarabhatta. Accord-
ding to the testimony of the Isvaravilās akāvya of Krşņakavi
composed about 1744 A. D., Prabhākarabhatta was a habitual
resident of Mathura though his son Vrajanātha resided at Jaipur
in company of Maharaja Sevai Jaising. It appears that Ratnākara-
bhațța's family had a Deccani origin? and it is possible to suppose

1. Vide my article on The Ašvamedha performed by Sevai
Jaising of Amber (1699-1744 A. D.) ' in the Poona Orientalist, Vol. II,
p. 174. The genealogy of Ratnākarabhatta as reconstructed by me on
the evidence of MSS is as follows :-
Devabhațța -Prabhakara-, -Vrajanātha (A. D. 1755)
(Surname Maha- (A. D. 1734)

My friend Pandit Hari Narayan Purohit, B. A. of Jaipur informs
me in a private communication dated 12-9-1938 that there is a grand
building and garden at Jaipur which once belonged to Ratnākara-
bhatta, the guru of Sevai Jaising. The descendants of Ratnākara-
bhaſta are still living at Jaipur. His library of rare MSS or rather a
portion of it that survived was added to the Private Library of H. H.
the Maharaja of Jaipur. I may suggest that a Manucripts Library
in the name of Ratnākarabhatta should be opened by the Jaipur
Darbar as a permanent memorial of the spiritual and religious asso-
ciation of Ratnakarabhatta with Maharaja Sevai Jaising, which brought
about a revival of Hindu religion in his reign.
2. Vide p. 170, Poona Orientalist, Vol. II. My reasons for
proving the the Deccani origin of this family are as follows :-

that his father or grandfather may have migrated from the Deccan
first to Benares and thence to Jaipur.
Though in my previous papers I have gathered some informa-
tion about Ratnākarabhatta and Vrajanātha (his nephew) I could
not get any information about Vrajanātha's father, viz. Prabhākara-
bhațţa beyond the fact that he was a resident of Mathura
(Mathuraikavāsi') and that his son Vrajanātha was a follower of
Vallabhācārya.' The very names Vrajanātha and his brother
Gokulanātha indicate the influence of Prabhākarabhatta's residence
at Mathura.
The influence of Ratnākarabhatta on Maharaja Sevai Jaising
appears to have been very great as he was his guru. It is, how.
ever, interesting to find that even his nephew Vrajanātha and his
brother Prabhākarabhatta had much to do with the course of politi-
cal events during the reign of Sevai Jaising. In fact they were
his advisers on important matters of state and in diplomatic
negotiations. These remarks can be substantiated by a con-
temporary letter dated 16th August, 1734,2 from an agent of the

(2) The gotra of this family was 'Sandilya' as stated by Ratna.
karabhatta in verse 27 of the Jayasimhakalpadruma ( fol. 4 of B. O. R.
I. MS 253 of 1887-91).
(3) The family deity was 'Ramacandra' as Ratnākarabhaſta calls
himself 'Ramānghripravana'. '(Vide verse 27 of Jayasimhakalpadruma
referred to above.)
(4) The surname of the family was ‘Mahāśabda' which is equal
to 'Mahāśabde' now current in the Deccan among Rgvedi Deśastha
Brahmins of Sāņdilya gotra. This surname is recorded by Viśveśvara,
the great grandson of Ratnākarabhațţa. (Ibid., p. 173).
At Mängdari in the Bhor State near Poona there is a temple of
Rămacandra, the family deity of the Mahasabdes belonging to that
place.

lows:- 'I, Babuji Joshi, in paying my respects to Shrimant
Rajesri Svāmi ( = Peshwa) have to report that owing to the bless-
ings of the Svāmi I (the writer) have fared well up to Sravana
vadi 14, Friday. It was only yesterday that I received the letter
of Dinânāthaji, who returned to Mathura after marriage. Dhondo
Govind is at present at Delhi, engaged in carrying out the orders
of the Svāmi. His letters will reach you shortly. In particular
(I have to state): Dinânāthaji came to Mathura, where Vījanātha,
the purohit of Raje Jaising is staying at present. (In spite of his
being a purohit ) he holds considerable influence at present.' He has
addressed one letter to you and also one letter to me to the effect
that Raje (i. e. Sevai Jaising) was very much distressed on
account of the molestations to his territory caused by Malharaji
Holkar and Rānoji Sinde. He desires to maintain friendly rela-
tions ( with you ) at least in future and for this very purpose Vţja-
nāthaji pressed Dinânāthaji to stay at Mathura and letters were
despatched to us. If, therefore, you are inclined to make an
alliance with Raje Jaising kindly arrange to send a letter to Aya-
malji stating that Dinānāthaji has been sent to him as your repre.
sentative to speak on your behalf. Kindly send one responsible
man to us with Dinânāthaji. Exchange of views will thus be
facilitated — so much should be stated in your letter. You may
also add that you desire to see him personally. In short he is a very
influential man and hence it is desirable to make friends with him
so that our object may be gained in course of time. Vrjanatha
Diksita and his father Prabhākara Dikṣita have sent a letter to you
(Svāmi). After a perusal of that letter kindly reply to thein in a
gratifying manner.' 2
I have no doubt that Vţjanāth mentioned in the above letter
of A. D. 1734 is identical with Vrajanātha, the son of Prabhākara as
we know from the Isvaravilāsakāvya of Krsnakavi ( 1744 A. D.).
Vğjanātha and his brother Gokulanātha were always in the company

officers. One of these envoys was a member of the Dikşita family.
Vide P. D., Vol. XXX, Letter No. 132, dated ‘about Sept., 1735

are a fost foarte ll 9011). Obviously Sevai Jaising enjoyed their
company very much on account of his own religiosity and the
capacity of Vrajanātha to expound dharma to his royal patron.
My identification of Vrjanātha Dikșita mentioned in the
Peshwa Dafter letter with Vrajanātha the nephew of Ratnākara-
bhatta is further supported by the identity of parentage, the
father's name Prabhākara being common to both the cases. From
Syāma Lațțu's Madhavasimhāryāśataka' (composed in A. D. 1755 )
we know that Vrajanātha was patronized by Madhosing, the son of
Sevai Jaising twenty-one years after A. D. 1734, the year of the
Peshwa Daftar letter of Babuji Joshi. Even in A. D. 1734 Vraja-
nātha was competent to negotiate an alliance with Dinânāthaji, the
Peshwa's representative and to enter into diplomatic correspon.
dence with the Peshwa Bajirao the First, who has been advised
by his agent Babuji Joshi to seek his friendship on account of the
tremendous personal influence of Vrajanātha over Sevai Jaising. It
may, therefore, be reasonable to suppose that in A. D. 1734 Vraja-
nātha was at least a middle-aged person and that during Madho-
sing's reign his friendship must have been sought by his royal
patron mainly on account of Vrajanātha's personal cordial rela-
tions with his father Sevai Jaising, who died in 1744 A. D.
Vrajanātha's father Prabhākara Dikşita was living in A. D.
1734 and must have been an elderly person claiming much respect
from Sevai Jaising on account of his being the brother of his guru
Ratnākarabhatta who composed his Jayasimhakalpadruma in A. D.
1713 by the order of Sevai Jaising. It is difficult to say anything
about the date of death of Ratnākarabhatta for want of evidence
though a conjecture may be warranted that he may then have been
living in a very advanced state of old age leaving his work to his
brother Prabhākara and nephew Vrajanātha, both competent to
advise Sevai Jaising in religious and political matters as indicated
by Babuji Joshi's letter of A, D. 1734.
I believe my present paper which links up Krşņakavi's testi-
mony of A. D. 1744 with an earlier contemporary letter in the
Peshwa Daftar of A. D. 1734 has to a certain extent revealed the
personality of Prabhākarabhațţa though nothing is as yet known to

36. Krşņa Kavi, the Author of Isvaravilāsa
Kāvya - His Works and Descendants,
Between A. D. 1669 and 1760 *
In my papers' on the Aśvamedha performed by Maharaja
Sevai Jaising of Amber I have made use of a contemporary kävya
called the Isvaravilāsakāvya? composed by Kęsņakavi, a court-
poet of Sevai Jaising, by the order of Isvarasing about A. D. 1744.
Copies of my papers in question were sent to the late Rai Bahadur
Dayaram Sahani, Director of Archaeological Researches at Jaipur
and 10 Pandit Hari Narayan Purohit of Jaipur as both these scho-
lars were keenly interested in these papers and made proper use
of them. Sahani made use of my papers in identifying a sacri.
ficial posta at Jaipur which he his proved to be the relic of the
Aśvamedha referred to above. Pandit Hari Narayan put me in
touch with an illustrious descendant of Krsna Kavi, the author of
the fśvaravilāsa Kavya. This descendant is no other than
Bhatta Mathurānātha, the author of several Sanskrit and Hindi

tory of his family in detail. This history is divided into two
parts:-(1) a metrical account of his family:called कुलप्रबंध in 132
stanzas composed by one of his ancestors. viz. हरिहरभट्ट' who is
referred to by Krsna Kavi in Isvaravilāsa kāvya and (2) वंशपरिचय
in Sanskrit prepared by Bhatta Mathurānātha himself on the basis
of sources for the history of his family available with him. The
Kulaprabandha is very important as it gives us the history of this
Tailanga Brahmin family upto A. D. 1700 or so. Harihara's father
Rāmakſşğa was in favour of Raja Ramsing and was the guru of
Krşņa Sinha. Rāmakrsna was the son of artist and brother of
नारायण, who was a pupil of Jagannatha Panditaraya' but unfortu-
nately his life was a short-lived one.
The family of Krsnakavi belonged to Taa gotra' according to
the Kulaprabandha ( = KP). The original ancestor of the family
was one बावीजीदाक्षित' who migrated to Kasi or Benares from

refers to रामकृष्ण's association with Ramsing :-
"श्रीरामसिंहस्तनयस्तदीयः। श्रीरामकृष्णं रमयांबभूव ॥११२॥"
3. Verse 114 of कुलप्रबंध states :-
__"गुरुवस्कृष्णसिंहेन रामकृष्णोथ मानितः"
Harihara refers to his father रामकृष्ण in verse 123 of कुलप्रबंध as
follows:

would have remained a sealed book to us.

KRSNA KAVI, AUTHOR OF IŠVARAVILASA KÄVYA

According to Bhatta Mathurânătha Krsna Kavi was boro in
Samvat 1725 = A. D. 1669 and died after Sarhvat 1800 = A. D.
1744. If these dates are correct Krşņa Kavi was about 75 years
old in A. D. 1744 ; but as he was patronized by Isvara Sing and
Madho Sing he may have reached a fair old age. Madho Sing
came to the throne of Jaipur about A. D. 1751 after the struggle
for the throne lasting for 5-6 years and after the suicide under
tragic circumstances by Isvara Sing. The B. O. R. I. copy of the
work Sundaristavarāja is dated Samvat 1816 i.e. A D. 1769. If
Kțşņa Kavi died after A. D. 1744-45, the above copy was made
about 15 years after this date in A. D. 1760 when the age of Krsna
Kavi would have been 91 years. Perhaps he died a little earlier than
A. D. 1760, the date of the B. O. R. I, MS of the Sundaristavaraja
in which he is called “afa fifag Folara.” Bhatta Mathurânātha
states on the authority of a Hindi work' that the title oglaselja iga
was conferred on Krşņa Kavi by Sevai Jaising.

Kșşņa Kavi makes a reference to his deceased father Gehot in
the following extract of his Padyamuktāvali :-
(Sahityavaibhavam p. 557) -

Besides the title "कविकलानिधि" conferred on Krsna Kavi by
Sevai Jai sing he also obtained the title TipArai from this King
in appreciation of the poet's work “ TTATIAI." Madhosing gave
Krsna Kavi one village' (1) कर्मपुर and (2) in हथरोही village, land
measuring 100 bighas. In the पधमुक्तावली Krsna Kavi expresses
his gratitude to Madhosing in the following verse :-
(Sahityavaibhavam, p. 564)-
" श्रीमद्राजाधिराजे सतिसमुपकृतं भरि रामायणेन

Krşņa Kavi appears to have wandered in different parts of
India. His contact with Malwa is echoed in some parts of his
Padyamuktavali. In his poem Išvaravilāsa he describes the
foundation of Brahmapuri by Sevai Jai sing and the god Ganeſa
at Ganesagadh in Brahmapuri.' He also refers to the foundation

when Madho Sing came to the throne. Krşņa Kavi's work
Durgabhakatitarangiņi may have been composed at Bharatpur
before his contact with King Budha Simba of Bundi, who came to
the throne in A. D. 1707. An echo of this contact of our poet
with Bharatpur is found in the Padyamuktāvaliwhich refers to
king Suryamalla of Bharatpur. One Audumbarabhațţa was a rival
of Kţsna Kavi as we find from a contemptuous reference to him
in one of his verses.' Elsewhere we find a reflection of our
poet's sense of self-confidence and self-respect, which was charac-
teristic of the poet Bhavabhūti of old. In fact the poet was
determined to pass his last days at Vịndāvana after the tragic
suicide of Isvara Sing in A. D. 1751 but on account of the pressing
request of Madho Sing he remained at the Jaipur Court."

An accurate estimate' of our poet's learning and poetic
abilities has already been given by Bhatta Mathurānātha who is
himself a Sanskrit poet of no mean order and hence I need not
enter into this aspect of my study, which is merely confined to
Krşņa Kavi's life and works as disclosed by his own works and
contemporary history.
So far I have dealt with the ancestry of our poet as rocorded
in the Kulaprabandha of Harihara Kavi, a cousin of the poet.
Bhațța Mathurānātha has given us the genealogy of Kșşņa Kavi's
descendants and their lives in the Vamśavithi which closes with an
account of his own life up to date. We need not, therefore, deal
with it here.

37. Some contemporary Evidence regarding
the Aśvamedha Sacrifice performed by Sevai
Jayasing of Amber ( 1699-1744 A. D.) *
In an article on “Sewai Jayasingh of Amber, A. D.
1699-1743" Mr. Dines Chandra Sircar states :-
“I am going to show that Sewai Jaising most probably did not
celebrate any Aśvamedha and that he was certainly not a vassal of
the Mughal emperors of Delhi during the later years of his
reign."'s
ludes his arms that Sewis feuda
He further concludes his article with the remarks: “We
therefore, hold that the suggestions that Sewai Jayasing of Amber
performed a horse sacrifice and that he was a feudatory of the
Mughal emperors all through his life ( or at the time of celebrating

2. Vide Peshwa Daftar Selection No. 14 ( Maratha Conquests in
the North) Letter No. 39, dated 21st October, 1735 - This is a news
letter received at Satara from the Maratha agent, Mayaram at Delhi
and communicated to the Peshwa. It mentions the Plans of the
Emperor to oppose the encroachments of the Marathas. It states
further :-"The Mogul Emperor (pātashah) is displeased with Jaya
Singh because he made an alliance with tñe troops of the enemy (i.e.
the Marathas ) by paying them some money.
Another letter in the Peshwa Daftar (selection 9, Letter No. 16,
dated April, 1736 ?) from Narayan Dikshit Patankar to Bajirao Ballal
advises the latter to perform religious sacrifices (while at Jaipur) only
through Deccani priests. It further states :-- "I hear that you have
gone to Jayanagar this year... the Raja ( viz., Jaya Singh ) is very tricky
(pratāraka). He will press you to perform Agnihotra or sacrifices but
please tell him that you are unable to do so without the command of
your guru...... If, however, you are constrained to respect his pressing
request I am sending priests ( to help you to perform these sa crifices)

EVIDENCE REGARDING ASVAMEDHA SACRIFICE BY SEWAI JAYASING 289
the supposed Aśvamédha) are both inadmissible. (Some points
in this note were suggested to the author by Prof. H. C. Ray
Chaudhari).”
It is for students of history proper to see how far the conclu.
sion reached by Mr. Sircar regarding the Aśvamedha sacrifice is
tenable. I shall, however, record here the following evidence
which definitely contradicts Mr. Sircar's conclusion that Sewai
Jayasingh did not perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice.
I think the testimony of a court-poet of the Jaipur State will
have to be considered with some respect to decide the point at
issue. Such testimony is fortunately available in a historical poem
called the I svaravilāsa Kāvya,' which was written by order of
Isvara Singh, the son of Sewai Jayasingh of Jaypur, the subject of
Mr. Sircar's note referred to above. The following verse 13 of
Chapter I of the I'śvaraviläsa Kävya, supports my statement :
" Bria: qalgratatfuqa: hakata:
संप्राप्तोत्साहकश्रीहरिहरसुकवे संशयं संशयन्नं ।
काव्यं नव्यं सुभष्यं भुवि रचयति यः प्रीतये पंडितानां
सोऽयं श्री कृष्णशर्मा कृतमति नमति श्री गुरोरंघ्रिपनं ॥ १३॥"
It is, therefore, clear that Krsna Kavi was the court-poet of
the Jaypur State about A. D. 1743-44 and even earlier. He com-
posed the poem under reference at the tim.c of the coronation of
Isvara Singh under an express order from this prince as stated in
verse 34 of chapter X which reads as follows :-

of the Yajamāna who was no other than Sewai Jayasingh himself
as stated in verse 22 of chapter V which deals with अश्वमेधवर्णन or
description of the Aśvamedha sacrifice :-
"द्वौ वीणागायिनी विप्रो श्रीकृष्णकविलक्ष्मणौ।
राजर्षिभिः समं तत्र यजमानमगायताम् ॥ २२ ॥"
Chapter IV of this poem deals with a HÀNH or the prepara-
tions of this Ašvamedha sacrifice while the next chapter V deals
with the detailed description of the sacrifice. Brahmans wearing
red turbans stalked in the sacrifical maņdapa distributing blessings
to the Yajamāna :-
" विरेजुलोहितोष्णीषाः प्रचरंतो मखे द्विजाः ।
राज्ञेऽस्मै यजमानाय दायमानाः शुभाशिषः ॥ २८॥"
A beautiful picture of the Yajamāna, Sewai Jayasingh, is
given by the poet in the following lines :-
" तत्र धौततमे सूक्ष्मे वाससी विमले वहन् ।
कृष्णाजिनधरः स्कंधे मृगशंगं करे दधत् ॥ ३७ ॥
अश्वमेधमखे दीक्षा विभ्रस्परमदुर्लभां ।

शिखासूत्रधरोदारं दीप्तिराजर्षिसंस्तुतः ।
साक्षाद्धर्मावतारोऽसौ यजमानोव्यराजत ॥ ३९ ॥"
The Yajamāna had his sacrificial hath in the waters of the
Manasagara lake :---
" नानातीर्थशतानीता नीरनिक्षेपभासुरे ।
मानसागरतोयेषु चकारावभृथं नृपः ॥ ५१ ॥"
In verse 8 of chapter III Sewai Jayasingh is called "वाजिम-
खयाजिभूपति." In verse 23 of chapter IV we are told that Sewai
Jayasingh announced his intention of performing an Aśvamedha
sacrifice "अतः परं कत्तुमनाः किलास्मि भवस्प्रसादादहमश्वमेधं" and sent
letters to learned Brahmans of Benares to that effect "चक्रेऽधिवा.
राणसिपत्रलेखं महामहापंडितराजचक्रे" (verse 28). The sacrificial mandapa
was erected on the banks of the lake Mānasāgara as stated in the
closing verse of the chapter called वाजिमेधारंभ :-
" पूर्व मानक्षितिपतिकृतेः सागरस्य प्रतीरे ।
राज्ञा तेन व्यरचि विभवैमंडितो यज्ञवाटः ॥"

EVIDENCB REGARDING ASVAMEDHA SACRIFICE BY SEWAI JAYASING 291
The date of Sewai Jayasingh's death is recorded by Krona
Kavi in verse 11 of chapter X :
"वर्षे सोष्टादशशततमे विक्रमार्कस्य शाके
मासे चैवाश्विननिगदिते शुक्लभूतादिने च ।
प्रातःकाले हृदयकमलानीतगोविंददेवो
देवो देवोपमगतिरसून्प्रोग्यतस्मिन्विलिल्ये ॥ २१॥"
The date recorded in the above verse tallies in material parti.
culars with the date of Sewai Jayasingh's death as given in Vira-
vinoda' viz., 14th day of the bright half of Aśvina, 1800 Vikrama
Samvat” which corresponds to Tuesday, 9th October, 1744 A. D.
In view of Krsna Kavi's testimony regarding the performance
of the Aśvamedha sacrifice I find it difficult to agree in the opinion
expressed by Mr. Dines Chandra Sirkar that Sewai Jayasingh
did not perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice. Mr. Sircar states:“ If he
(Sewai Jayasingh) performed any Aśvamedha at all he might
have done it after 1739 and before 1743.” Presuming this state.
ment to be correct I would like to point out that the difference
between the date of composition of the Isvaraviläsa Kavya and the
date of the performance of the Aśvamedha sacrifice would not be
greater than 5 years and consequently the testimony of Kțşņa Kavi
regarding the performance of the Aśvamédha sacrifice and its
graphic description as indicated above, will have to be regarded
with some respect as it is a contemporary piece of evideoce.
Secondly, Kțşņa Kavi was himself present at the sacrifice as stated
by him.

38. The Aśvamedha performed by Sevai
Jayasing of Amber ( 1699 - 1744 A. D. ) *
In my article published in the Journal of Indian History,'
Madras, I produced contemporary evidence to contradict the
suggestion of Dr. Dinesh Chandra Sarkar that “ Sevai Jayasing
most probably did not celebrate any Aśvamedha." Since the publi.
cation of my paper I have come across some more documentary
evidence of an anthology called the Padyatarangiņi, 3 MSS2 of
which are available in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Insti-
tute, Poona. This evidence corroborates the evidence already
recorded by me proving beyond all doubt the performance of the
Ašvamedha by Sevai Jayasing. I shall refer in this paper to the
MS of the Padyatarangini viz. No. 725 of 1886-92 acquired by
Peterson for the Govt. of Bombay. The work was composed by
* Poona Orientalist, Vol. II, pp. 166–180.

corresponds to 14th January 1753. Verses 1 to 37 at the end of

Sevai Jayasing and the sacrifice performed by him. I shall, there-

The mention of TTÀ (v.3) and of ÀY (verses 4 and 5) by
Vrajanātha in A. D. 1753 will settle once for all the doubts of
historians regarding the performance of the Aśvamedha sacrifice by
Sevai Jayasing. The explicit statement of Vrajanātha that Jaya.
simha performed the hayamedha according to Vedic injunctions
("acticà a fargar TÀ ... ETO") is another direct contemporary
testimony of a writer connected with the Jaipur court in 1753 A.D.
and it would be worthwhile recording in this paper some informa-
tion about this writer furnished by contemporary records.
A poem in praise of King Mādhava Simha = Madhosing, son
of Sevai Jayasing, was composed by one Syāma Lattū in Saka
1677 (= A. D. 1755 )i.e. two years after the composition of Vraja-
nātha's Padyatarangiņi. The title of this poem is Mādhava-
simhāryā-Sataka.' It mentions the names of several learned men
who flourished at Jaipur during the reign of Madho Sing. They
are :- Gangārāma (v. 122), Rāmeśrara (v. 123), Gopinatha
(v. 124), Viśvanātha (v. 124), Vrajanātha (v. 125 ), Sudhākara
Śarmā (v. 126), Yamunākara Śarmā (v. 127), Haridatta Śarmā
(v. 128), Kevalarāma ( v. 129 ); Sadāśiva Sarmā ( v. 130), Ravidatta
Sarma ( v. 131 ), and Samkaradatta (v. 132), who was perhaps a
Mahārāstra Brahmin ( ETTEI tra 90979iamyrat - "v. 133). The
verse which describes at reads as follows :-
" जयति श्रीव्रजनाथः कविरिह सततं व्रजाधीशे ।
सुकलितदृढतरभक्तिर्जयपुरनगरे पुराधीशे ॥ १२५ ॥"
The statement made in the above verse that Vrajanātha was
strongly attached to Madhosing is proved by the composition of

his patron.
More information about the family of Vrajanātha is supplied
to us by Krşņakavi the author of the Isvaravilāsakāvya, only one
MS of which is available in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R.
Institute, Poona viz. No. 273 of 1883-84. In chapter X of this
historical kāvya we get the following verses regarding Vrajanātha
Sarma and other members of his family :-
Folio 37 -

The above verses explicitly tell us that Sevai Jayasing
entrusted the administration of the state to his son Isvarasingh
(v.5). He then spent his time in devotional duties towards God
Govinda ( v. 6). In the whole assembly of pandits at his Court
there was always by his side one Vrajanātha Sarmā, who was the
son of the brother of his guru and who was very much respected on
account of his deep learning. Vrajanātha had performed a Paun.
(Continued from the previous page)
upon the Maratha forces by orders of Madhosing.” In an earlier
letter ( No, 29 dated 15 Feb. 1751) Madhosing is styled "दुर्बुद्धि" or
wicked and " विश्वासघातकी" or treacherous.
. 1. In the colophons of the MSS of Jayasimhakalpadruma
compiled by Ratnakara, the author is called "देवभट्टात्मजपौंडकियाजि-
रत्नाकर" (See MS No. 253 of 1887-91, folio 193).

ďarika sacrifice. Ratnákara was the guru of the King (Jayasingh).
He was an ornament to the line of Rgvedi brahmins. He had a
brother by name Prabhākara, who always resided at Mathura
(v. 8). One of his sons was Vrajanātha while the other was called
Gokulanātha. These two brothers were always at the side of the
King expounding to him the meaning of the Sāstras (v. 9). Vraja-
nátha, who was the wisest among the brahmins personally expoun-
ded the Šāstras to the King almost without a break and in this
manner the King passed his entire time in the company of the
learned, listenting to the Sāstras and acting according to dharma
(v. 10).
After the tragic end of lśvarasingh,' Vrajanātha appears to
have transferred his loyalty and attachment from Sevai Jayasing
to his other son Madhosingh as evidenced by the composition of
the work Padyatarangiņī referred to above which was definitely

1. Vide Peshwa Dafter II, (p. 53) Letter No. 31 dated 21st
February 1751. This is an important news letter addressed to Govind-
pant Bundele by his accountant Baburao Vishnu, from the camp of
Malharrao Holkar and Jayapa Scinde in the vicinity of Jaipur.
This letter of five pages gives a detailed account of the circumstances
which resulted in the suicide of iśvarasing and the treacherous
conduct of Madhosing against the Maratha forces led by Subhedar
Malharrao Holkar and Jayapa Scinde.
The old administiators of the State viz. Hargovind and Vidya-
dhara reported to Iśvarsing that the troops of Holkar had arrived at
the gate of Jaipur. Išvarsing asked them to negotiate for peace but
they refused to approach Holkar whereupon feeling helpless and
desperate 1śvarsing ordered his page to get a live cobra as also some
somalkhär ( = arsenic). He then took some of this poison himself
and got the cobra to bite him. He died early at dawn. His three
wives and one mistress also poisoned themselves and fell dead in the
palace rooms. Har Govind and Vidyadhara reported this tragic
occurrence to Holkar, who kept a guard at the palace and later
cremated the body of Išvarsing with due honour along with the
bodies of three wives and one mistress. After successful negotia.
tions carried on by Har Govind and Vidyādhar, Ilolkar withdrew
his forces from the town of Jaipur. One queen and twenty mis-
tresses of Išvarsing burnt themselves as Sati. Madhosing returned
to Jaipur after a fortnight and rode into the town on elephant's
back together with Holkar. Jayapa Scinde came to Jaipur eight days
after Madhosing's arrival.

composed to please his new patron. From the verses quoted
above from the Isvaravilāsakāvya we get the following genealogy
of Vrajanātha's family :--
Ratnakara
--
Prabhākara
Vrajanatha
Gokulanātha
Ratnākara mentioned in the above genealogy given by Krşņakavi
in his Isvaravilāsakāvya is identical with Ratnākara, the author
of the Dharmaśāstra compendium called the Jayasimha-Kalpadruma
composed at the request of Sevai Jayasing. Ratnākara belonged
to the Sāņqilya gotra and was the son of a Brahmin, Devabhatta, a
resident of Benares.' The Isvaravilāsa Kävya has given us the
name only of one brother of Ratnākara viz. Prabhākara. It ap-
pears, however, from Ratnākara's reference to his brothers in the
Jayasimha-Kalpadruma that he had two brothers.?
Ratnākara completed his Jayasimha Kalpadruma in A. D. 1713
Samvat 1770, in the month of nabhas i.e. Bhādrapada ) as stated
in verse 5 of the colophon. Further information about the
descendants of Ratnākara is luckily available and my attention
d. Vide the following verses at the beginning of Jayasimha-
Kalpadruma ( MS No. 253 of 1887-91) fol. 4 -
"तेन श्रीजयसिंहन सर्वशास्त्रार्थसंविदा ।

The two brothers to whom Ratnākara bows in the above verse
may have been older than himself and it is possible to conclude that
Prabhākara was one of them.

is Saturday, 25th of July, 1713, which is the date of completion of

was drawn to it by Dr. Hara Datta Sharma.' His study of a work
on Dharmaśāstra composed by the great grandson of Ratnākara
gives us some more details not recorded in the Jayasimha-Kalpa-
druma or the Isvaravilāsakāvya. This great-grandson is none other
than Visvešvara, who wrote a work called Nirnaya-Kaustubha?
between A.D. 1788 and 1803 according to Dr. Sharma. Višveśvara's
surname was Mahāśabda.' In another work composed by Visvešvara
and called Pratāpārka“ he states that his surname was Mahāśabda
(HETTOCITAT) and that he was the great grandson of Ratnākara-
bhatta, the author of the Jayasimha-Kalpadruma, grandson of
Gangārāma® and son of Rāmeśvara.? We have already seen that
Ratnākara mentions his gotra viz. Śâņạilya in his Jayasimha-
Kalpadruma. Viśveśvara also has mentioned this Sandilya gotra
in his Pratápārka.8 The genealogy of Ratnākara's family gathered
from the work Pratápārka may now be presented as follows :-
------- - --- ---
1. Dr. Sharma has submitted to the Ninth Oriental Conference
an article on “Nirnaya Kaustubha or Laghunirnaya-Kaustubha of
Visvesvarabhatta — Its date and Contents.” I am thankful to Dr.
Sharma for allowing me the use of this article to make my account of
Ratnākara's family as complete as possible.
2. Only one MS of this work is available in the Govt. MSS
Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, viz. No. 350 of 1875-76
( 45 folios ) dated Samvat 1863 = A. D. 1807.
3. Ibid, verse 1 at the beginning :-
"प्रणम्य जानकीजानि महाशब्दोपनामकः।
fargent: garH aifaTETTEL 1" etc.
"HETSTES" is a surname current among the Maharashtra
Brahmanas. It is possible to conclude that Ratnākara's family
came from the Deccan and resided at Benares.

ऋषिरिव बभूव चास्यां पुर्या भूदेववोयं ॥ १२२॥
तरसूनुर्द्विजराजः श्रीरामेश्वराभिधः सूरिः।
श्रीपौण्डरीकयाजी विराजते ब्रह्मपुर्या यः ॥१२३॥"
In the colophons of जयसिंहकल्पद्रुम its author is styled “पौण्डरीक.
याजि रत्नाकर." In verse 3 at the end of the जयसिंहकलाम the perfor-
mance of पौण्डरांक sacrifice is attributed to रत्नाकर (श्रेष्ठं सर्वक्रतुभ्यो विविध
विधियुतं पौण्डरीकं च युतं etc.). I have no doubt that गङ्गाराम and his son
रामेश्वर mentioned in 1755 A. D. are identical with their namesakes
mentioned later in the प्रतापार्क of विश्वेश्वर.

THE AßVAMEMEDHA PERFORMED BY SEVAI JAYASING
301
Sevai Jayasing we have also the testimony of a pandit at the court
of Mādhavasing in A. D. 1755. He is described by Syāma Lattu,'
the author of Madhavasimhāryā Šataka as follows :
"Fala pariata graf glagaunf quiaa: 1
Atyatargani acha GTA: FTUATAT: 11 93011".
The Sadāśivaśarmā mentioned in the above verse in a work
composed in A. D. 1755 is possibly identical with the author of a
work on dharmaśāstra called the Acārasmſticandrikū2 by name
Sadāśiva. This work begins as follows :-

2. MS No. 236 of 1887-91 in the Govt. MSS Library at the B.
O. R. Institute, Poona. Vide P. V. Kane's History of Dharmaśāstra,
Vol. I, p. 754 where we have the following information about Sadā-
śiva and his works :
"सदाशिव, son of गदाधर of the दशपुत्र family. First quarter of the
18th century ; author of 31197Ħaaraat ( composed for king für
of FIFTTT), forma ef71.".
The B. O. R. I. MS mentioned above is the only MS of Acara-
smſticandrikā recorded by Aufrecht ( Vide Cata. Catalo. III, p. 9.)
Vide also Peshwa Daftar No. II - Letter No. 7 dated A. D.
1747 — This is a news-letter addressed to the Peshwa from the
Maratha camp near Jaipur. It describes the great terror and
anxiety created by the presence of the Maratha forces in the mind
of Madhosing. The letter contains a reference to “HE TIG GT-
rarepoft” who is also called " HEUT" and whom Madhosing consulted
in his embarrassing situation. Most probably, this matt Hot is
identical with CTTATAI mentioned by Syāma Laţțu in 1755 as associ-
ated with the court of Madhosing. A person whom Madhosing con-
sulted in his troubles in 1747 may have attained some influence at
his court later after the enthronement of Madhosing on the gådi of
Jaipur in A. D. 1751.

In the above extract verse 4 is very important as it mentions
the performance of ITTÀU or Aśvamedha by Sevai Jayasing and
the attendance of Benares pandits on the occasion, not to say the
numerous presents given by the king to these Brahmins.
We shall now quote a few verses at the end of the work which
contain a reference to Jayasing by our author. These verses
read as follows :-
" मीमांसानयमांसलातिविमला प्रज्ञा तया भूयसी
दृष्टिः श्रौतनिबंधचारचतुरा येषां सदाचारिणां।
तेषां दृष्टिपथं प्रयातु सुहृदां संदर्भ एषस्थितः

इति श्रीमहशपुत्रकुलावतंसेन विरचिता सदाशिव-

In the foregoing extract the author Sadāsiva definitely states
that the work was composed to please his patron Jayasing (जपसिंह-
alhau tratare ar partrar ). We must, therefore, presume that this
work on dharmaśāstra was composed during the life-time of
Jayasing i.e. before A. D. 1744, the date of Jayasing's death. As
this work refers to तुरगमेध (or अश्वमेध) it must have been composed
after the performance of the Asvamedha. We must, therefore,

Page 334****************************************************************************************
THE ASVAMBDHA PERFORMED BY SEVAI JAYASING
303
attach the highest evidential value to Sadāśiva's reference to
ITTÀU as it is a piece of contemporary evidence coming from a
person in direct contact with his patron Jayasing. We also find
that Ratnākara, the author of the Jayasimha-Kalpadruma, though
he refers to the other kinds of sacrifice in which Jayasing was in-
terested, does not make any reference to Aśvamedha-an omission
which may enable us to fix the probable limits for the date of the
performance of the Aśvamedha viz. A. D. 1713, the date of com-
pletion of the jayasimha-Kalpadruma and say about 1742 A. D.
presuming that Sadāśiva must have taken at least two years for
the composition of his work Acarasmşțicandrikā and shown it to
his patron some time before his death. In addition to the refer-
ences about the Aśvamedha found in contemporary and subsequent
works of the 18th century as pointed out by me above I have found
a reference to it in a still later work called the Dharmasaṁgraha'
composed by Hariscandra by order of Rāmasimha of the Jaipur
dynasty. Hariscandra records in the beginning of his work some
genealogy of his patron and in doing so he refers to Sevai Jayasing
1. Only one MS of this work is recorded by Aufrecht (CC
II, 58) viz. " Peters 4.8". It is the same as No. 223 of 1886-92 in
the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona.
2. Ibid, folios. 1-3 — verses 2 to 22 read as follows :-

and his Asvamedha in verse 6 ( देवा : संतोषिता येन चाश्वमेधेना कर्मणा).
The genealogy recorded by Hariscandra is of the princes from
Sevai Jayasing onwards. It is as follows :--
(Sevai) Jayasimha-Mädhavasimha-Pratāpasimha - Jagatsimha
-jayasimha-Rāmasimha.
The above genealogy appears to be substantially correct.'

with the exception of the omission of the names of Isvarasimha
and Pșthvīsimha, whose careers were not apparently very impor-

I have recorded the testimony of Hariscandra regarding the
Aśvamedha of Sevai Jayasing even though it belongs to the middle
of the 19th century to make my list of references to Aśvamedha as
comprehensive as possible.

contact of this author with Sevai Jayasing has been amply
proved in this paper.
4. Evidence recorded by Visvešvara in his work called the
Pratāpārka composed between 1788 and 1803.
5. Evidence recorded by Fariscandra about the middle of the
19th Century in his work called the Dharmasaṁgraha.
The foregoing references to the Aśvamedha performed by
Sevai Jayasing made by pandits patronized by the Jaipur line of
princes are conclusive so far as they go. The echo of this epoch-
making religious event which then caught the imagination of the
citizens of the Jaipur State must have reverberated throughout the
lengih and breadth of the Hindu India and hence it is possible to
collect more references to this Aśvamedha in Rajputana records
which unfortunately are not at present accessible to me. Perhaps
in the Peshwa Daftar recently published by the Govt. of Bombay
a few contemporary references to this event are likely to be traced.
I shall, however, conclude this paper by reproducing a reference
to this Ašvamedha made by a Maharashtra Brahmin in 1782 A. D.
This reference as found in the Sources of Maratha History' publi.
shed by the Maharashtra historian V. K. Rajwade is as follows :-
Letter No. 136 - dated Saka 1704, Māgha vadya 5 (=Sunday
3rd February 1782 ) Mādhavrao Anant Vedānti writes to the young
Peshwa a long letter of advice in which he deplores the decay of
Hinduism in general and notes the special efforts made by certain
Hindu kings to revive it. One such effort was made by the king
of Jaipur by the performance of Aśvamedha. In the opinion of
the writer all these efforts were disconcerted and hence not quite
effective. He then refers to the incarnation of God Siva on this
earth in the form of the Maratha king Shivaji the Great and his
life-long efforts to preserve Hindu literature and culture,

(1699-1744 A. D.) as given in the
Isvaravilāsakāvya of Krşņakavi *
Fitz-Edward Hall in his preface to the Edition of the
Sankhyapravacanabhāşya' observes :-"An anecdote, which I have
heard from several pandits, synchronizes Nägeśa ( Nāgojibhațța)
with Jayasimha, Raja of Jaypur, who, as is known from the Jaya.
simhakalpadruma-by Ratnākarabhatta, son of Devabhatta--was
reigning as late as the Samvat ycar 1770 or A. D. 1713.” This
anecdote is identical with the traditioncurrent at Jaipur, which
refers to an invitation for a horse sacrifice (Aśvamedha)
received in 1714 1. D. by Nārnjibhatta from Sevai Jaysing ( 16.99-
1744 A. D. ) hat which Nagusihitta refused on the ground that
he had taken kşetras:nyās i and hence could not leave Benares to
attend the ceremony. James Todd' ( 1782-1835) refers to the
Aśvamedha as follows :-
“ Amongst the vanities of the founder of Amber it is said that
he intended to get up the ceremony of the Aswaméda yúga or
sacrifice of the horse."A Perhass the vague nature of these refer-
ences was responsible for the theory recently postulated by
Dr. Dinesh Candra Sarkars that " Sevai Jayasing most probably
did not celebrate any Aśvamedha.” I controverted this theory on

the strength of contemporary evidence' furnished by a historical
poem called the lśvaravilāsakāvya. This poem was composed by
one Kșşņa Kavi, a court-poet who wrote this poem to commemo-
rate the coronation of Iśvarasing, the son of Sevai Jayasing of
Jaipur. Krşņa Kavi states that he and another fellow-poet ( Śrī
Kệşņa Kavi-Laksmanau ) were assigned the parts of singing
the praise of the Yajamāna at this horse-sacrifice or Aśva-
medha, to the description of which he devotes two chapters
viz. Chapters IV and V of his poem. As the Government Ms
Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, possesses the only
known copy of this poem (No. 273 of 1884-1886) and as Kļşņa
Kavi's description of the sacrifice appears to me to be an eye-
witness's account of this epoch-making religious event, I have
thought it advisable to reproduce the text of these two chapters
about the Aśvamedha of Sevai Jayasing as it is found in the Ms.
I have recorded additional evidence regarding this Aśvamedha
from contemporary and subsequent sources in a recent paper
contributed to the Poona Orientalist, Vol. II. That evidence
combined with the description of the sacrifice contained in the
chapters reproduced below will satisfy all historical curiosity
about this event. I may, however, note here the names of persons
who were present at this sacrifice as stated by Krşņakavi :
(1) Kțşņa Kavi, the author of the Isvaravilāsa Kāvya.
(2) Lakşmaņa.
(3) Rāmacandra Ayācita.
(4) Rāmacandra Dravida.
(5) Vyāsa Sarmā
(6) Guņākara.
(7) Hari Krsna Sarmā, a Karnātaka Brahmin. He appears to
be identical with हरिकृष्णमिश्र who composed a work वैदिक-
a coceragrart by order of Sevai Jayasing (Ms No. 443 of
1891-95.B. O. R. Inst. ).
It may be possible to identify some of these names from con-
temporary and other sources,

Dr. BelVALKAR in his Systems of Sanskrit Grammar' mentions
an author of the name Varadarāja in three places but does not
record any information regarding his date. Dr. A. B. KEITH also
refers to the school grammar of Varadarāja in his History of Sans-
krit Literature but does not record any chronology for this author
and his works. Pandit Ganesh Dutt SHASTRI in his Edition of
Varadarāja's Madhyakaumudis has no remarks to offer about this
author's chronology. Pandit Uddhavaji Ranachodji SHASTRI in his
edition of the Laghusiddhantakaumudia does not deal with Varada-
rāja's chronology. He, however, records the opinion of some
scholars that Varadarāja, the author of Laghukaumudi was a pupil
of Bhattoji Dikșita and hence his contemporary. It is not, how-

1. Poona, 1915 - Pages 51, 62, 104. Varadarāja is the author of
abridgments of the Siddhanta-Kaumudi of Bhattoji Dikşita. These
abridgments are represented by three editions : (1) Madhyaº, (2)
Laghuº and (3) Sāra-Siddhanta Kaumudi. The major abridgment
was commented upon by Rāmaśarman at the request of one Sivā-
nanda and the middle one by a Jayakşşņa, son of Raghunāthabhațţa
and grandson of Govardhanabhațţa of the Mauni family. - Varada-
rāja's Laghu-Kaumudi corresponds in treatment and subject-matter
to the recast called Bålāvabodha of the Candra grammar by a Ceylo-
nese Buddhist priest about A. D. 1200 - In later times no attempt
was made to improve or supplement the Sarasvata grammar and the
abridgments of Varadarāja and other works ousted the Sarasvata
from the field.

ever, possible to find from any source an account of Varadarāja's
life.
In view of these remarks of the editor of Varadarāja's works
I propose to record in this paper some data regarding the works
of Varadaraja with the intention of clarifying to some extent at
least the chronology of this author left in a nebulous state by pre-
vious scholars in the field.
Owing to the popularity of Varadarāja's works we find nu-
merous MSS of them recorded by Aufrecur in his Catalogus Cata-
logorum under the titles of the following works attributed to
him :-

2. In the Preface to the Laghu Kaumudi Edition ( 1849 ) of Dr.
J. R. BALLANTYNE we find no information regarding Varadaraja's
chronology. He merely states that Laghu Kaumudi of Varadarāja
is an abridgment of the Siddhanta Kaumudī of Bhattoji Dikșita.

One Dhundirājakavi composed at Benares a work called, “fajo-
वाङ्मञ्जरी" which appears to be similar to Varadarāja's गीवाणपदमञ्जरी.
It may have been an imitation of Varadaraja's work but I have not
studied the chronology of Dhundirāja Kavi and hence cannot deter-
mine his indebtedness or otherwise to Varadarāja.

Now let us try to put some limits to Varadarāja's chronology.
As Varadarāja has abridged Bhattoji's work Siddhānta-kaumudi
with a view to popularising it we shall put about A.D. 1620 as one
limit to Varadarāja's date. I have proved elsewhere that Bhattoji
Dikşita flourished between A. D. 1560 and A. D. 1620 and the
above limit for Varadarāja's date harmonises with Bhattoji's date
fixed by me. The other limit to Varadarāja's date is furnished
by a dated MS9 of his work Sārasiddhantakaumudi available in the
Govt. MSS Library (B. 0. R Institute, Poona). It is dated
Samvat 1739 = A. D. 1683. On looking to the other dated MSS of
our author's works at the B.O.R. Institute I find that the above MS
of A.D. 1683 is the earliest dated MS of Varadaraja's works at least
among MSS of his works available at the B. O. R. Institute. In
1. CC I, 714; CC II, 170; CC III, 714.
2. Annals of S. V. Oriental Institute, Tirupati, Vol. I, Part 2,

3. MS No. 539 of 1886-92 — Colophon records the date of the
MS:-"संवत् १७३९ ज्येष्ठमासे कृष्णपक्षे अष्टमी शुक्रवासरे प्रयागतः लिषितं नरोत्तम.
For FTTA Fesariadi etc.” This is in harmony with other dated MSS of
Varadarāja's works at the B. O. R. Institute:--

view of this MS may we may fix Varadarāja's date between A, D.
1620 and A. D. 1683.
With a view to narrowing down the limits given above we have
to examine the tradition recorded by Pandit Uddhavaji that Varada-
rāja was a pupil of Bhattoji and hence his contemporary. It
appears to me that this tradition does not conflict with the limits
for Vardarāja's date given by me above viz., A. D. 1620 and 1683.
In fact Varadarāja bows to his guru Bhattoji Dikşita at the begin-
ning of his Madhyakaumudi as follows in the Lahore Edition of the
work (1899) :--
" नवा वरदराजः श्रीगुरून्भट्टोजिदीक्षितान् ।
करोति पाणिनीयानां मध्यसिद्धान्तकौमुदीम् ।। १ ॥"
If this verse is a genuine part of the text of Varadarāja's work
the traditional statement that our author was the pupil of Bhattoji
1. The B. O. R. Institute MS of Madhya-Siddhānta. Kaumudi
No. 564 of 1887–91 begins as follows:
"येनाक्षरसमाम्नायमधिगम्य महेश्वरात् ।
कृत्स्नं व्याकरणं प्रोक्तं तस्मै पाणिनये नमः ॥१॥
येन धौता गिरः पुंसां निर्मलेः शब्दवारिभिः।

पायकारं वररुचि भाष्यकारं पतञ्जलिम् ।

नत्वा वरदराजः श्रीगरून्भट्टोजिदीक्षितान् ।
FITFH 4T forfra 1714 1,chfugi (a) a HTH 11 % II”
In the above extract the fourth verse containing a reference to
Bhattoji Dikșita is preceded by 3 verses while the India Office MS of
the work No. 667 (p. 178 of I. O. MSS Cata. Part II, 1889 ) begins
with the verse "791 GTGT:... Hely." as in the Lahore Edn. of 1899.
2. M. M. Haraprasad SĀSTRI accepts this tradition (Vide, pp.,
cix of Preface to Des. Cata. of V yākarana MSS. Vol. VI, 1931 - R.
A. S. Bengal) -- " Bhatļoji Dikṣita had a disciple named Varadaraja
who made three abridgments of his works......... " Speaking of Hext-
HATCHT the comm. on Fetoget of Varadarāja M. M. Šāstri says :-
" It is simply abridgment of the Praudhamanorama as far as it re-
lates to the Sūtras of the Madhya. The commentary is by Ramacandra
Surmă who wrote it at the request of Sivānandabhaçţa or Sivananda
Gosvami and it was dedicated to Vidyānivasa the most prominent
Pandit of Bengal at the time of Akbar and who was perhaps the guru of
the author" (p. cx).

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Dikşita is directly borne out by the text. Towards the close of
the Madhyakaumudī or Madhyasiddhantakaumudi Varadarāja refers
to this work as his own production.' It appears to me that both
the verses i.e., the verse at the beginning referring to Bhattoji and
the verse at the close mentioning Varadarāja's authorship of the
work are Varadarāja's own composition as these verses have one
line in common. The statement of Aufrecht that Varadarāja was
the son of Durgātanaya is evidently based on the following verse
at the end of the Sarasiddhāntakaumudi (MS No. 539 of 1886-92
dated A.D. 1683, folio 33):-
" कृता वरदभट्टश्रीदुर्गातनयसूनुना।
वेदवेदप्रवेशाय सारसिद्धांतकौमुदी॥"
At the close of his Laghusiddhānta Kaumudi: Varadarāja refers to
the Sabdakaustubha of Bhattoji as follows :-
"शास्त्रांतरे प्रविष्टानां बालानां चोपकारिका ।
कृता वरदराजेन लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी।
सिद्धान्तकौमुदीशब्दकौस्तुभाभोगभोगतः ।

VARADARAJA AND HIS WORKS
321
Varadarāja in his Girvanapadamanjarī' refers to several works
which ought to be studied by a Pandit. In this list? he refers to
some works on grammar in which we find the following works :-:
___(1) मनोरमासहितसिद्धांतकौमुदी, (2) मध्यसिद्धांतकौमुदी, (3) लघुसिद्धान्त-
कौमुदी, (4) शब्दकौस्तुभ, and (5) लिंगानुशासनवृत्ति,
Out of the five works on grammar mentioned by Varadarāja three
belong to Bhattoji while the other two viz:-(1) मध्यसिद्धान्तकौमुदी
and (2) लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी are the works of Varadarāja himself as we
have seen above. As Varadarāja refers to two of his works in the
गीवाणपदमञ्जरी composed by him we have to presume that they were
composed by him earlier than the गीर्वाणपदमञ्जरी and by putting
them side by side with his guru's work viz. सिद्धान्तकौमुदी with
मनारमा and शब्दकौस्तुभ and others in the course of grammatical
works he has apparently tried to give them a status and popularity
which these abridgments of Bhattoji's works have ever since enjoy.

of the Gbäts' of Benares. This contemporary list of Ghats
would be useful for the history of Benares topography. In this
list we find a place called Kedåreśvara-Ghatta. In the account of
Bhattoji's life recorded by Rao Bahadur W. A. BAMBARDEKAR* we
are told that Bhattoji Dīkşita built a house for himself at Kedar-
Ghäța in Benares and settled there permanently. It would be
worthwhile examining this statement on the strength of con-
temporary topography and settling the exact location of Bhaſtoji 8
house at Kedarghat.
Varadaraja refers to the houses of some contemporary
Brahmins but the names of these Brahmins recorded by him may
be imaginary names mentioned for purposes of illustration only.
We also find in this work a list of holy places or tirthas on folio 6
of the MS as follows:

Can any scholar at Bea ares verify the names recorded in the
above extract and see if they are imaginary or otherwise ? In case
they turn out to be real names of owners of houses at Benarcs wc
shall have to identify these names, if possible, in contemporary
sources. We know that ATTEIHE was the son of one F274373 but it is
difficult to connect this शिवभE with the शिवभगृह near दुग्धविनायक in

I have recorded above the lists of Southern and Northern holy
places in India which Varadaraja has taken care to record
incidentally in bis Girvanapadamañjari, which appears to have
been composed say between A. D. 1600 and 1650. In this list the
reference to rettanta is important as the presiding deity of this
place i.c. कालहस्तीश was the family deity of रजोजिभट्ट, the brother
of महाजिदीक्षित.' In my present analysis of Varadaraja's Girvāna.

padamañjari I have used only the MS of this work at the B. O. R.
Institute. The India Office Catalogue' describes a MS of this
work as follows:-
“Samskrtamañjari (or Girvånapadamañjari) being courses of
elementary conversational questions and answers on everyday
occurrences, on literary, devotional and other subjects ; by Varada-
rāja Diksita." Though in the Colophons of this MS the work is
called संस्कृतमञ्जरी, its correct title is गीर्वाणपदमञ्जरी as stated in the
body of the work. Rajendralal MITR+' describes a MS of this
work as follows:
“An elementary grammar of Sanskrit language, in the form
of a dialogue interspersed with moral tales. "
The colophon of this MS calls the work by the name afrator-
पदमारी and not संस्कृतमम्जरी as stated in the Colophon of the India
Office MS of the work. The Ujjain MSS Library has also a copy
of oraingeht. From the data recorded above we are able to
establish the following conclusions :-
(1) Varadarāja (=VR) was a pupil of Bhattoji Dikşita ( = BD).
(Continued from the previous page)
BAMBARDEKAR is of opinion that the native place of Rangojibhatta
must have been somewhere in the territory adjoining this temple in
the country of Telangana. It is, therefore, reasonable to suppose
that both Rangoji and his brother Bhattoji were Tailanga Brahmins,
and not Särasvatas as claimed by some writers.

(2) VR appears to have been a Southerner:as his name Varada-
räja suggests. He should be distinguished from his namesake,
the author of a dharmaśāstra work called the spaarpfatura, which
was composed before A. D. 1350.'
(3) As V R has abridged Bhattoji's Siddhantakaumudi and as
he mentions Bhattoji's works like सिद्धांतकौमुदी with प्रौढमनोरमा and
शब्दकौस्तुभ in his own work गीर्वाणपदमम्जरी we may say that he flouri-
shed later than A.D. 1620 about which time Bhattāji's literary career
appears to have come to an end. This fact coupled with the fact
that Bhattoji was the guru of Varadarāja, enables us to fix about
A. D. 1600 as the earlier limit to Varadarāja's date. The later
limit for the date of VR may be fixed at about A. D. 1650 as we
have a copy of V R's work dated A. D. 1683.
(4) VR appears to have been a contemporary of another pupil
of Bhattoji viz. Nilakantha Sukla, who composed his Sabdasobha
in A. D. 1637 and a small poem called the Cimanicarita in A. D.
1656.
(5) VR does not record any biographical information regard-
ing himself in his four works known to us except the name of his
father who is called griau in the Sarasiddhantakaumudi (MS of
A. D. 1683). At the end of the गीर्वाणपदमञ्जरी he says " गीर्वाणपद-
ASTTT ... Togsfradt Hàa." It is possible to suppose that notar
was the name of V R's father and gai the name of VR's grand-
mother? As god Gaņeśa is the son of Durgā or Pārvati VR may
have used the name rinat to suggest: (1) notat the name of
his father, and (2) gni the name of his father's mother i.e. V R's
grandmother.
(6) As regards the relative chronology of V R's four works we
1. Vide my paper on the Date of V yavaharanirnaya (Mimänsä
Prakāśa, Poona, Vol. III, pp. 15-18). Pandit Jvālāprasad Miśra in
his edition of the Laghu-Siddhanta-Kaumudi (with Hindi comm. )
1927, pp. 18-20, states that Varadaraja composed this work in A. D.
1593. He further states (1) that this Varadarāja composed the 49ert-
Faculet and (2) that Bhattoji Dikşita was contemporary of Sted the
author of the quarta-This mixture of anachronism and dogmatism
has been severely criticized by Rao Bahadur BAMBARDEKAR ( Vide pp.
180-188 of Bhagfoji Dikșita – Fñātiviveka, 1939).

author of the Sabda-Sobha and Nilakantha Sukla, the author of the

are able to state that his मध्यसिद्धान्तकौमुदी' and लघुसिद्धांतकौमुदी were
composed earlier than गीर्वाणपदमञ्जरी. Perhaps सारसिद्धान्तकौमुदी may
have been composed later than the oiatoregavit, which though it
mentions #787°2678 and syalyst does not refer to the attºrget.
This omission appears to me significant in the case of Varadarāja
who has put his own abridgments side by side with Bhattoji's
works referred to in the staforgga 570t.
(7) The earliest dated MS of VR's work so far as I know is
dated A. D. 1683. This MS is at the B. 0. R. Institute. It
supplies to us a sure later limit to VR's date as we have seen
above.
(8) VR shows a close knowledge of the City of Benares in the
first half on the 17th Century as will be seen from the list of
Ghațțas of Benares incidentally recorded by him in the staja.
Tht.
(9) VR's works were commented on by two commentators
रामशर्मन् and जयकृष्ण. Perhaps an examination of these commentaries
and their chronology may throw some more light on VR's works
and personality.
(10) VR appears to have been a contemporary of the celebrat-
ed Kavindrācārya Sarasvati who was successful in persuading
Emperor Shah Jahan to abolish the Pilgrim Tax on pilgrims visit-
ing Benares and Prayāga and who lived between A. D. 1600 and

Cimani-Carita are identical, though there is a difference of about 20
years between the dates of composition of these two works. See also

1902 - BENDALL gives "in or about the 16th century” as the date
for Bhattoji's pupils and their works while describing a MS of Hello
hatargat.
2. There is a MS of Laghu-Siddhanta Kaumudi described by
H. POLEMAN on p. 130 of his Catalogue of Indic MSS in U. S. A.
and Canada ( 1938). It is dated Samvat 1680 = A. D. 1624. If this
date is correct this is the earliest dated MS of Varadaraja's work and
hence most important for bis chronology.

1670.' In the collection of addresses presented to Kavindācārya
we find a small prasasti of Kavindra attributed to an author of
the name fasuro A7,who remains unidentified. In the Girvana-
padamañjari of Varadarāja ( MS No. 395 of 1899–1915) there is a
reference to a place or locality called fassaport. The connection
of the author faasa rout with a locality of the same name cannot
be definitely determined at present. Perhaps the author in ques-
tion may have been named after the place-name fashTOTT or vice
versa.
11. A MS of Laghusiddhānta-Kaumudi in America is dated
A. D. 1624. Presuming this date to be correct we have to consi-
der the effect of this date on the chronology of Bhattoji as also
that of Varadarāja. In my paper on Bhattoji's date I had noted a
MS of Bhattoji's Sabdakaustubha (R. A. S. Bengal) dated A. D.
1633 and on the strength of this date and other evidence I had
suggested that Bhattoji's career may have ended in about A. D.
1620. This inference gets strengthened by the date A.D. 1624
of a MS of Laghusiddhānta-Kaumudi, which is an abridgment of
Bhattoji's own work Siddhantakaumudi. If the abridgment of a
work is represented by its copy in A. D. 1624 we must presume
that the original work must have been composed some years ear-
lier than the abridgment.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
As the Girvånapadamañjari mentions (1) Madhyaº Kaumudi
an I (2) Laghuº Kaumudi composed before A.D. 1624, I am inclined
to hold the view that these two abridgments of the Siddhanta-
kaumudi may have been composed before A. D. 1620 and they may
have received the benefit of Bhattoji's guidance during the last
decade of his literary career.
I shall now close this paper with the following chronological
table showing at a glance the dates of Bhattoji's guru Nțsimhā-
śrama and his own pupils (1) Varadaraja and (2) Nilakantha Sukla:-

during the 18th century. I am not so far aware of any early ver.

Cimanī-Carita*
A ROMANTIC LOVE-POEM BY A PUPIL OF BHATTOJI
DIKSITA DEALING WITH THE LOVE OF THE DAUGHTER-
IN-LAW OF ALLAH VARDI KHAN TURKMAN
(BETWEEN A. D. 1605-1659 )
Mr. Q. M. Moneer' has recently published three Persian
inscriptions of Allāh Vardi Khān Turkmãn from the ancient
hill-forts in the Nasik District of the Bombay Presidency. They
are engraved on rocks in the Sātmāla ranges on which are erected
the ancient forts of Indrā'i, Chāndor and Dhodap. They were
inscribed in the name of and very probably at the instance of Allāh
Vardi Khân himself, who conquered not only the forts on which
they are carved, but thirteen other forts in the same area, which
are mentioned by name in two of these three inscriptions. Allāh
Vardi Khão Turkmãn of the inscription claimed descent from a
Sovereign of Central Asia of the name Sultan Sanjar (A. D.
1086-1157 ). The chronology of Allāh Vardi Khān's life as record-
ed by Mr. Moneer ( on p. 9) is as follows:

Shujā returned and by false means got hold of
AVK and his son Saifullāh. The father and the
son were then paraded on elephant's back through
the City of Benares and put to death.
The above history of AVK's career at the Mughal Court as
recorded by Mr. Moneer shows AVK's importance at the Imperial
Court, though unfortunately it had a sad end. This history is
based on contemporary Persian Chronicles. I propose to record

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
in this paper some interesting information about the household
affairs of AVK as revealed in a Sanskrit poem called the Cimani.
Carita,' composed by Nilakantha Sukla in A. D. 1656. I shall
prove in a special paper, that this author is identical with
Nilakantha Sukla, pupil of Bhattoji Dikşita, who composed a
grammatical work called the Sabda-Sobhā in A. D. 1637.2 From
these dates of the works of Nilakaņķha Sukla it is clear that he was
a contemporary of AVK. This contemporaneity coupled with
the contact of A VK between A. D. 1656 and 1657 with the City
of Benares, where AVK and his son met their sad end, leads me
to infer that Benares Pandits must have been well aware of the
life-history of A VK then current in Benares academic circles
which were in the favour of Dārā Shukoh, who met his death almost
in the same manner in which AVK and his son were put to death
by Dārā's brother Shujā. My inference further gets support
from the contact of Dārā with AVK in A. D. 1653, in which year
AVK accompanied Dārā to Qandhār to capture that city from
the king of Persia. It is thus possible to suppose that Nilakantha
Sukla residing at Benares and composing his works in A. D. 1637
and 1656 must have been fully aware of the personal history of
AVK through some Pandits of Benares in direct contact with
Dārā Shukoh. If this position is accepted we can easily explain
how Nilakantha Sukla composed his poem Cimani-Carita (in A. D.
1656i.e, one year before the death of AVK at Benares) in which
a Muslim noble of the name “stocracia " is actually mention.
ed. In fact this romantic poem is based on a contemporary
scandal developed in the harem of Alaha Virdī Khān mention-
ed in the poem. I am of opinion that the Muslim noble “ 374E-
faglara” of Cimani-Carita is identical with Allāh Vardi Khân of
the inscriptions dated A. D. 1636, in which year Nilakantha com-
posed his work at Benares called the Sabdasobhā. Before I men-
tion my points of identity it is necessary to give the reader an
idea of the contents of this short poem called the Cimani-Carita
in which Cimanis is the heroine belonging to the harem of this

Muslim noble. Her relation to Allāh Virdi Khān is clear from
the following stanza ( 52 ) of the poem :-
"यासावासीदलहविरदीज्येष्ठबंधोस्तनूजा

याता ख्याति जगति चिमनीत्याक्षया या गवाक्षे

Cimani was, therefore, the daughter of the elder brother of
Alaha Virdi Khān and at the same time his daughter-in-law, being
the wife of his eldest son. Her romantic love with Dayādeca
mentioned in the above stanza is the theme of the poem. In
Stanza 1 Dayādeva Sarma is introduced as a handsome youth.
In St. 2 his beauty and youth are described as bewitching to the
ladies of the harem of Alaha Virdi Khān. Dayādeva approached
the Khân for some employinent and was appointed as a tutor to
the ladies of his harem ( St. 3). The khân ordered an old lady of
the name Mānikā to attend during the time of instruction impart-
ed to the young ladies (St. 4). Further as a precaution against
the possibility of any workings of the Cupid in the harem, con-
sequent upon such factors as the beauty and youth of the ladies,
the presence of a Brahmin guru of a youthful age and the privacy
of the harem, the Khân appointed a Chamberlain of the name
Aniša to keep a watch during the iine of the lessons (St. 5-6).
But these arrangements of the Khân proved futile and the
Chamberlain Anisa proved of no avail in preventing the
mischievous activities of the God of Love (St. 7). The poet
then describes these workings of tlie Cupid in a charming manner.
In Stanza 52 we are introduced to the heroine of the poem viz.
Cimanī, the daughter of the elder brother of Alaha Virdi Khân,
who was at the same time the wife the eldest son of this Khān.
Cimani falls in love with Dayādeva Sarma and the poet des-
cribes their course of love in the latter half of the poem. In St. 67
we find two names मुखलिस and झाफरीय आलय or the house of Jafar

lady or may have been the daughter of a Hindu lady admitted into
the Muslim harem and then converted to Muslim faith. The sojourn
of Allāh Vardi Khan in the Deccan in A. D. 1636 for conquering the
forts in the Nasik District may explain the Marāțbā name “Cimapi"
of our heroine. “Cimani” means a sparrow and by metaphor is
applied to young ladies as a pet name.

(Khão ). Mukhalis' was the elder brother of Alaha Virdi Khan
while Jafar was the name of Cimani's husband. Mukhlis is again
referred to in St. 71 by the poet.
Jafar mentioned in the Cimani-carita (St. 67 ) must be distin-
guisbed from Jafar Khan (mentioned by Bernier )s who was the
Prime minister of Aurangzeb. Bernier referes to the perfidy of
one Allah-verdi-khan with Sultan Sujah. This Khân may be
identical with AVK of the Cimani-carita and of Mr. Moneer's
inscriptions of A. D. 1636.
The love between Cimani and Dayādeva developed intensely
in course of time but Cimani was curious to know if Dayādeva
was really a Hindu :-

----
---
1. In the account of AV K given by Mr. Moneer .we are told
that Mukhlis Khan was the brother of AVK. This brother was
companion to Prince Parviz between A. D. 1606 and 1627. Through
Mukhlis Khăn AVK was presented at the court of Jahangir. It
seems that Cimani, the heroine of the Cimanicarita, was the daughter
of this Mukhlis Khân mentioned by our poet.
2. Vide p. 186 of Bernier's Travels ( 1656-1668) Constable,
London, 1891 - Among partisans of Aurangzeb Bernier mentions "the
son of that Allah-oordikan, whose advice cost Sultan Sujäh the battle
of Kadjoue, was made Governor of Scimdy." The Editor remarks :
" Jafar Khân, appointed Subadar of Allahabad, where he died in
1669 ( Beale )” and identifies the son of AVK with Jafar Khăn. If
this identification is correct the Jafar of Cimani-carita was the son
of AVK, husband of Cimani and the son-in-law of AVK's brother
of Mukhlis Khân. The love of Cimant with a Brahmin youth Daya.

"हिंदु काय ब्रजसि हृदयं कुत्र मे चोरयित्वा

Dayadeva replied that he was Brahmin and showed her his

"विप्रोऽहं तत् प्रणयपदवी तेऽधिगन्तुं न योग्यो"
Cimani said :-
" मेवं ब्रूयाः पुनरपि सखे योग्य एवासि यस्मात् ।"
Dayadeva :-
" स्वन्मायुध यदवधि मनोमनमासीन्ममासं
विप्रोऽहं तत् प्रभृति पुरतः पश्य यज्ञोपवीतं ॥ ८८॥"
The two lovers passed their time happily as stated in St. 101
which concludes the romantic poem :-
" अनुनिशमवशिष्टं कर्तुमासीव किंचित्
किमपि न कृतमेव प्रत्यभानुप्रभाते ।
यवनिपतितनजे प्रोषिते भाग्यभाजो-
रिति विविधविलासैर्वासराणि व्यतीयुः ॥१०॥"
The poet is conscious of the beauty of this romantic poem as
depicted by him :-
" रस एव स ईश्वरः श्रुताविति नितिमतोऽभिधीयते।
चिमनीचरिते रसाश्रितं वचनं चेन मम श्रमः श्रमः ॥ १.२॥"
The poem scems to be a true story based on a contemporary
love affair developed in the harem of Allāh Vardi Khän Turkmän.
Whether any echo of this love story is found in Persian Sources,
I cannot say at present as I am not conversant with these sources.
With a view to helping further investigation of this story I repre-
scot its historical back-ground with the persons concerned in it as

The occurrence of the names Alaha Virdi Khan, Mukhlis, and
Jafar in the Cimani-carita composed in A. D. 1656 by a pupil of
Bhattoji Dīkşita and their indentification in other sources dealing
with the life-history of Allāh Vardi Khan Turkman is not a mere
coincidence. We are, therefore, fully justificd in presuming that
the author of this romantic poem was in full knowledge of the love
affair of the daughter-in-law of the celebrated Muslim noble of
Shah Jahān's court. It appears that this noble , who employed a
Brahmin tutor for the ladies of his household, may have patronised
another Pandit of the name Lal Bihari' who is the author of a
Persian version of Mitäkşara composed in A. D. 1657 or so.
As the poem Camani-carita is not a historical Kāvya we can-
not expect any history in it pertaining to the careers of the
members of the family of Allāh Vardi Khān. In the foregoing
study I have used two rare Manuscripts of the poem in the Govt.

the Mss of this poem about 15 years ago but I could not then
determine with certainty its historical background. Contem-
porary Kävyas, though not exactly of the historical type have a
value of their own in giving to the history of a period that colour
which is sometimes lacking in the dynastic and political history of
the same period. Poetry as a reflection of contemporary life
cannot fail to enrich the cultural history of a period, provided we
are able to penetrate the gossamer of the poet's idealized narration
and plant our feet on the terra firma of historical truth. I feel
confident that close students of the Persian sources of the Mughal
period will throw more light on the subject of this paper than
what I have been able to do by presenting some new material
regarding the household affairs of Allah V ardi Khan Turkman.

The Oriental Biographical Dictionary by Thomas William
Beale ( London, 1894), p. 47 contains biographies of three persons
of the name Alahwirdi Khan (or more correctly Ilahwirdi Khan).
Two of these persons are mentioned in Cimani-carita as Alaha
Viradi Khan and Jafar respectively. Their biographies as given
by Beal may be recorded here :-
(1) “Alahwirdi Khan - a nobleman of the reign of Emperor
Jahangir. He was raised to the rank of 5000 in the time of Shah
Jahan and held several offices of importance. He was appointed
Governor of Patna and espoused the cause of Sultan Shujā,
brother of Aurangzeb A. D. 1658 (A. H. 1068 ) and after the
defeat of Shujā accompained him to Bengal where he was slain
together with his son Saif-ullah, by order of that prince in July
A. D. 1659 ( Zil-qa'da A. H. 1069 ).”
(2) "Alahwirdi Khan or more correctly Ilahwirdi Khan,
title of Jafar Khân, the son of Ilawirdi Khān the first. He was
raised to the rank of an Amir by ‘Alamgir' with the title of
Ilahwirdi Khãn' Alamgir-Shāhi'. He was appointed Subadar of
Allahabad where he died in A. D. 1669 ( A. H. 1079). He was an
excellent poet and has left a Diwan.”

attempt to fix the limits of the date of the Padyaracanã on the
strength of these names.
The Kävyamālā edition of the Padyaracană contains lacunae in

the authorship of the work is ascribed to ( " farface more"

ses were composed by our author. The last 2 verses of the antho-
logy are followed by the endorsement "gat anuT " which leaves
no doubt about their authorship.
The total number of verses in the Padyaracana is as follows :-

The total number of verses as specified above comes to 769,
and if we add the 2 verses found at the end of MS No. 726 of
1886-92 ( Padyaracanā) this number would be 771.
We have now to see what exact contribution Lakşmaņa has
made to the present anthology. The following table records
verses in each chapter which are followed by the endorsement
“ TEHOTET " and which may, therefore, be looked upon as the com-
position of our author :-

Total 152 Verses ascribed to Lakşmaņa.
It would be seen from the above analysis that out of the total
of 769 verses of the Padyaracanā, Lakşmaņa claims no less than
152 verses i.e. about one fifth of the entire anthology. Evidently
he wanted to shine among the learned of the past generations by
incorporating his own compositions in this anthology of their ver-
ses. His purpose appears to have been served by the publication
of the anthology in the K’ävyamālā Series, which has already immo-
rtalised many poets and poetasters.

In the above list we find that Laksmana mentions and quotes
from an author called 370 371a Flegral who was of course patro-
nized by Emperor Akbar ( A. D. 1556-1605 ).
In view of the references to waita ere found in the
Padyaracanã we may fix A. D. 1610 or so as the earlier limit to
the date of the Padyaracanã of Lakşmaņa. The later limit to the
date of this anthology may be fixed at A. D. 1710 or so in view of
the dated MS of the work copied in A D. 1741 (B. D. R. I. MS
No. 7.6 of 1886-92).
Mr. Krishnamachariar states that Lakṣmaṇabhatta, the com-
mentator of the Naişadha kavya of the Sri Harsa “ also wrote a
poem Padyaracana.” Let us now see if this statement is correct.
Lakşmanabhaſta, the author of the commentary on the Naişadha
was the son of Rāmakſıņas but the name of the father of Lakşmaņa
the author of the Padyaracana is not traceable in the Padyaracanã.

In the same manner it is difficult to identify CROT the author of
the Padyaracanã with E FUT the author of a work called TAROT as
appears to have been done by Aufrecht (CC I, 536). In the
Pad yaracanã the author invokes God Siva in the first verse while
in the Ratnamāla he bows to God Krsna (“ कृष्णं नमामि मनसा वसुदेव-
Th”). In the absence of any objective proofs to enable us to
identify the three authors of the name o' it is open to doubt if
they are identical or otherwise. At any rate no a priori case for
their identity has been forthcoming.
Onp. 8 of the Padyaracanã the following verse is introduced
as "लक्ष्मणस्य" in the manner of many other verses of लक्ष्मण the
author of the anthology :-

article on the date of this commentator in the Calcutta Oriental
Journal ( Vol. II pp. 309-312) where I have proved that this author
Aourished between A. D. 1431-1730.
Aufrecht (CC I, 536 ) makes the following entry regarding the
author of the Padyaracana :-
" लक्ष्मणभट्ट - Padyaracanā
- Ratnamälä"
R. Mitra describes a MS of TWAIST ( p. 286 of Vol. VI of Notices,
1882) as a “collection of miscellaneous verses illustrating particular
rhetorical maxims, with many riddles and enigmas.” In this descrip-
tion the name of Lakşmaņa's father is not found. The work consists
of 354 Slokas.
1. Peterson (p. 54 of Third Report) describes a palm-leaf MS
of a work called Fararst composed by 28 (“planiratt inė atau genuit
Gare - verse 1). This MS was in the Temple of Sāntinátha,
Cambay.

In the Padyamstatarangini' Haribhaskara composed in A. D.
1673 we find the above verse quoted as follows:
Folio 18a of MS No. 314 of 1884-86.
" इयं चिपापि प्रकटजलरूपापि भगवती
यदीयाम्भोबिन्दुर्वितरति च शम्भोरपि पदम् ।
पुनाना धन्वाना निखिलमपि नानाविधमघ
जगत्कृत्स्नं पायादनुदिनमपायात्सुरधुनी ॥४१॥
-ZEROTET'
I am inclined to presume that Haribhāskara Agnihotri who
composed nis anthology in A. D. 1673 and who quotes one of
Lakşmana's verses about Gangā apparently knew the Padyaracanã
for which I have fixed the chronological limits, viz.“ Between
A. D. 1610 and 1710.” If this presumption is correct we must
suppose, on the strength of the identification of the two verses,
that the Padyaracanã of our Lakşmaņa is earlier than A. D. 1673,
the date of composition of the Pädyāmſtatarangiņi. I am, there
fore, inclined to hold the view that the date of the Padyaracana
must lie, say between A. D. 1625 and 1650. This view is consistent
with the statement made by the editors of the Padyaracanã that
Lakşmaņa Arkoļkar' was a native of Mahārāştra. It is possible to
suppose that Haribhāskara, who was himnself a native of Nasik in
Mahārāştra, knew the work of Lakşmaņa Anko!kar, another earlier
author of an anthology similar to the Padyaracana.
1. Vide my article on this anthology in the Calcutta Oriental
Journal, Vol. III pp. 33–35. The exact date is 12th June 1673. ...
2. This verse has been quoted in the Subhāşitaratnabhändā.
gåra ( N. S. Press, 1911 ) p. 9 — verse 124.
3. Surnames ending in Kar current in the Mahārāştra generally
indicate that the native place of the holder of the surname is identical
with the name of the place preceding the affix Kar. Lakşmapa
Asko!-Kar may have been a native of Ankoļ. There is a village of
the name Akol in Chikodi Tāluka of the Belgaum District in the
Bombay Presidency. I cannot say if Ankoļ = Akoļ.

43. Some Verses about the Kāyastha-
Parabhūs composed by Keśava Pandita by
the Order of King Sambhāji, Son of Shivāji
- c. A. D. 1675 *
In a work called the Parabhū-prakaraṇa' which contains an
account of the Parabhū grāmanya of A. D. 1747 during the reign
of the Maratha King Shāhu, grandson of Shivāji, some 33 verses
are quoted as the composition of Sambhurāja or Sambhāji (“TH-
aglat:”). The Parabhū-prakarana is a work of anonymous
authorshipcomposed by some one after A. D. 1759 and before
about A. D. 1800.' In view of these verses appearing in a later
work removed more than 100 years from Sambhāji's death in A. D.
Annals ( B, O. R. Institute), Vol. XX, pp. 235-248.
1. Two Mss of this work are available to me viz. (1) No 567 of
1883-84 and (2) a Ms in the Limaye Collection of the B. O. R.
Institute.
2. Verse 1 at the beginning roads :--
“श्रीसिद्धिबुद्धिसहितं प्रणम्य गणनायकं ।
केनचिद्विदुपा रुच्या लिख्यते परभुकथा।"
The B. O. R. I. Ms ( No.567 of 1893-84 ) of the 91495107 has the
following closing verse :-
" इत्थं तु परभूवृत्तमभूच्छाही प्रशासति।
स्मृत्यर्थ तत् फक्किकाभिरबध्नात् कोपि पंडितः॥"
It will thus be seen that the author of the work has taken suffi-
cient care to keep himself anonymous. Both the above verses occur
in the Calcutta copy of the work made by 77950 TTC Fuita in A. D.
1810 ( Saka 1732). Vide Mitra's Notices, X., p. 296.
3. The Calcutta M8 of the work is dated Saka 1732 = A. D. 1810
(Vide p. 296 of Mitra's Notices, Vol. X, 1892) M8 No. 4198. The
latest date mentioned in Limaye Ms of the 974799TU is Saka 1681
for A. D. 1759).

1689 their authorship as mentioned in the Parabhū-prakarana' is
open to challenge. We must, therefore, record and discuss these
verses to enable the students of the Maratha history to form their
own judgment on the question of the authorship of these verses.
The text of these verses based on the two Mss of the
Parabhū-prakarana available to me reads as follows:
Folio 6 - " श्रीम(त) छंभुराजकृत श्लोका यथा ॥
आसीत् पृथिव्यां शिवभूप इंद्रो'
विराजमानः सचिवैर्यथेन्द्रः ।
प्रसघ यस्मै भवनस्य राज्य

1. Cf. Kayastha Parabhi-Dharmadarsa of Nilakantha Vinayaka
Thatte composed between A.D. 1823 and 1827 ! pp. 129-139 of the Jour.
of Ori. Research Madras, Vol. XIII, part II, April-June 1939). This
work was composed possibly in connection with the Parabhu-grāma.
nya of A. D. 1823 with which Balajipant Natu of Poona was closely
associated. (Vide चांद्रसेनीय कायस्थप्रभु अस्सल आज्ञापत्र by T. V. Gupte,
Poona, 1918 - The 31751193 of Samkarācārya published here on pp.
1-21 is dated Saka 1748 = A. D. 1826. Nilakantha Sastri mentioned
in this 31751197 is identical with the author of the Kayastha-Parabhū
Dharmadarta. On p. 21 of this आज्ञापत्र we read “पुणे मुक्कामी निलकंठ
शास्त्री प्रभृती ब्राह्मणांनो आग्रही तंटा करून दोन वर्षे तड पाडून दुफली केली होती" etc.

In the B. O. R. I. Ms ( No. 567 of 1883-1884) of the Parabhi-
prakarana the following colophon has been written in the top-
margin of folio 11 as an addition after verse 33 :-
" इति श्री शंभुराजाज्ञया शंभुराजसभायां विद्वजनसहकेशवपंडितकृत-
कायस्थपरभूनिर्णयः ॥ शके १५९७ राक्षसनामसंवत्सरे तहिनि रामचंद्रज्योतिर्विदा

The above colophon suggests that the verses quoted above
were copied from some Ms having the above colophon which
states the following important particulars :-
(1) The title of the verses taken together was कायस्थपरभूनिर्णय.
(2) The verses were composed by a fra by the order of
er or Sambhāji in consultation with other learned men of the
court of Sambhāji.
(3) The verses were copied by one Rāmacandra Jyotirvid or
Joshi of Kalyana in Saka 1597 or A. D. 1675.
This colophon also suggests that the Mss of Aruktura Faure by
Kesava Pandita (from which yerses were reproduced in the परभू-
प्रकरण) actually existed, one such copy having been made in A. D.
1675 as proved by the above colophon.
The year of the Kalyāņa copy of Keśava Pandita's work viz.
A. D. 1675 ( Saka 1597) seems to show that this copy was prepared
in the very year in which the Parabhū gråmanya of Saka 1597 took

particulars about 9 Parabhū grāmanyas, the 4th of which took place
at Kalyāņa in Saka 1595 = A. D. 1675. The identity of subject
matter, date and place as proved by the B. O. R. I. Ms colophon
and the list published by Rajawade is not a mere coincidence and
hence it retains its evidential value unless contradicted by
stronger contemporary evidence.
The contents of the 33 verses quoted already may be briefly
indicated as follows:-
Bālāji Prabhū of the Kāyastha caste hailed from the village
Pāncvad fourded by Shivaji. He was a scribe to Shivāji. Bālāji
wanted to perform the Muñja ceremony of his son Khanda' and
made arrangements accordingly. He went to Shivāji with an
invitation for the Muñja ceremony. Shivāji directed Bālājia to
follow the advice of Sambhāji in this matter of the performance of
the Muñja ceremony of his son. He, therefore approached
Sambhāji and invited him to attend the ceremony. He also
sought his order for performing the ceremony. Sambhāji refused
to allow the performance of the ceremony, as according to the
Šāstras the Kāyasthas could not do so. Thereupon Bālāji
returned home rather disappointed and then dispersed his friends
and relatives that had gathered at his house for the Muñja cere-
mony. -- Keśava Pandita composed by royal order these verses
containing the substance of Sambhāji's advice to Bālāji Parabhū.
I am inclined to believe that Keśava Pandita who composed
the verses under discussion is identical with Keśava Pandita, the
author of the Räjärāma Carita published by Mr. V. S. Bendre. In
fact the following verse 22 of Sarga IV (p. 42) of this poem
composed by this Pandita refers to Khando Ballāļa, who is no
other than master Khanda, the Son of Bālāji Parabhū mentioned in
the verses (Circa A. D. 1675 ) :-
" FUSTAFETT *refeATHFTT: 1
चंद्रसेनान्वयाश्चान्ये श्रीदाभ्यकृतगोपनाः ॥ २२ ॥"
1. Khando Ballal Chitộis died in A. D. 1726 (vide p. 263 of
Marathi Riyasat ( Part II, Vol. IV, 1922 ) by G. S. Sardesai. His son
Govind Khando ( A. D. 1716-85 ) was a Chitņis to Raja Shabu.
2. Bālāji Avji became Chitnis to Shivaji in Saka 1570 = A. D.
1648. This date is given in the Bakhar of Malhar Rāmrao and in the
Sivapratāpa but the Jedhe Chronology has no mention of it ( vide p.
203 of fragittariq-S. N. Joshi's article ).

SOME VERSES ABOUT THE KÄYASTHA-PARABHOS
355
This verse tells us that in the expedition of Rajārāma Chatra-
pati to Jinji in A. D. 1690 Khando Ballāļa and other men of his
caste were present. This caste is specified by our author by the
adjectives -
“*1941: Paggar:, dharagt: " and " Text antigar: "
The origin of the Cândraseniya Kāyastha Parabhūs as speci-
fied by the above adjectives in the Rājāräma Carita is analogous
to that mentioned in the Sahyadri Khanda of the Skandapūrāņa ;
but it is difficult to assert that Keśava Pandita had before him a
the text of the Sahyādrikhanda as we find it today.'

its owner Mr. R. K. Patankar calls it " FTT F TOHO:" in the versi-

Kesava Pandita, the author of the Rajäråmacarita. If this view is ac-
cepted the importance of these verses will be easily recognized cspc.
cially in view of the fact that no other original work of this author
except the Rajaramacarita (edited by Mr.V.S. Bendre) has been so
far discovered and published. As Keśava Pandita was closely con-
nected with Śrī Shivaji Mahārāja and also his sons Sambhaji and
Rājārāma, an effort should be made by all interested in the Mara.

of this important personality who lived, moved and had his being
in the personal presence of the three outstanding Chatrapatis bet.
ween A. D. 1650 and 1700.
P.S.'1) Keśava Pandita appears to have compiled a work on
Dharmaśāstra called Dharmakalpalatā for King Sambhaji, son of
Shivaji. A portion of this work called दंडनीतिप्रकरण 'is represented
by a copy preserved in the Tanjore Mss Library (Ms No. 536-

Velankar for B. O. R. Institute (1926). Mr. V. S. Bendre intends
to publish in the near future the g ifagastu referred to above so
that we shall have before us three works of Keśava Pandita viz.

(2)-As the march of :Rajarama Chatrapati to Jinji in 1690
became the subject of the poem Rājārāmacarita by Kesava Pandita
in the Maratha country, the siege of Jinji (1689-1697) appears to
have captured the imagination of the people in the south so as to
become the subject of a Mono. Drama in Tamil called “Seyda-K.
Kadi Nondi.Natakam" (Ed. with Notes and English Introduction

by Dr. S. M. H. Nainar, University of Madras, Annals of Oriental
Research, 1939, Vol. IV, Part 1). This is a drama of the lame man,
who sings in honour of Seyda-K-Kādī, a generous patron of Tamil
poets, both Hindu and Muslim. This patron was a great friend of
Vijaya Raghunath Tevar alias Kilvan Setupati, ( 1674-1710). The
author of the drama appears to have been a convert to Islam. The
lame man gives in the drama his autobiography in which he re-
counts his adventurous journey to Jinji where the war between the
Mughals and the Marathas was in full blaze after the execution of
Sambhaji Chatrapati in A. D. 1689. The drama contains a con-
temporary picture in words of the Siege of Jinji and is full of
references to contemporary Mughal commanders under Zulfiqar-
khān and the Maratha commanders under Rājārāma Chatrapati. He
refers to Rājārāma in the following manner :- “At Jinji, great
among the far-famed cities, lived the son of Shivaji Raja, the lion to
his foes, at whose feet the enemies prostrate. He was a stern
upholder of justice. He was gifted with a beaming face and an
attractive personality. He was addicted to the pleasures of life."
We must remember that this is a contemporary picture of Rājā-
rāma's personality by a Muslim convert and hence should possess
some historical value for the students of the Maratha history. This
Mono-Drama in Tamil edited for the first time by Dr. Nainar with
an excellent historical introduction and based on only one Ms in
the Govt. Oriental Library, Madras, deserves to be translated into
Marathi or English for the benefit of the people of the Maharastra.
May I suggest to the Bharata Itihasa Samshodhak Mandal, Poona,
to include such a translation of this Mono-Drama in its project of
the Sources of Maratha History? As this institution has already
published some volumes of the Canarese and Persian sources of
the Maratha History, the publication of this Tamil source in the
form of a translation will enrich our knowledge of this period. As
Dr. Nainar observes the author of the Drama “sends the hero to
Jinji and through him has contributed in his own way some intere-
sting materials which help us in our historical studies."
[ In the Sāhendravilāsa-Kävya we find a reference to the siege
of Jinji (vide p. 187ff of Indian Antiquary, 1904). This poem was
composed by Sridhara Venkatesa. Rājāram received help from the
then Raja of Tanjore :-
" बलैमहाराज भवनिर्दिष्टदिल्लीन्द्रसैन्यानि विदारितानि ।
स राजरामश्च तथाभिगुप्तस्तदति स्वां महती यश:श्रीः ॥"]

birth date may lie between A. D. 1640 and 1645 but we require
evidence on this point.

Bernier' in his letter to Monsieur Chapelain? despatched from
Chiras in Persia on 4th October 1667 describes “the superstitions,
strange customs and doctrines of Indous or Gentiles of Hindo-
ustan." This letter is very valuable for students of the history of
Sanskrit learning at Benares during the 17th century, which yet
remains to be written on the strength of contemporary sources,
Indian and foreign. We know from Sanskrit sources many eminent
pandits of Benares and their illustrious works, but unfortunately
no attempt has been made to reconstruct any biographical accounts
of them from sources, other than Sanskrit works, which lack in
historical materials, unlike the Persian chronicles or the Travel

books of foreign observers which are full of chronological and other
details so essential for the reconstruction of history. Bernier not-
withstanding his “ignorance of Sanskrit, the language of the
learned and possibly that of the ancient Brahmans " has some-
thing' to say about books written in that tongue. His Agah,
Danechmend kan partly from Bernier's solicitation and partly to
gratify his own curiosity took into his service one of the most cele-
brated Pandits in all the Indies who had formerly belonged to the
house-hold of Dara, the eldest son of king Shah Jahan. This
Pandit, Bernier states, was his constant companion during a period
of three years and he introduced Bernier to the Society of other
learned Pandits, a whom he attracted to his house.

Jahan was made a prisoner. His son Dara Shikoh, a patron of Hindu
Pandits was executed in A. D. 1659. “One of the most celebrated
pandits in all the Indies " who was taken into the service of Ber-
nier's patron Danishmandkhan after Dara's execution in A. D. 1659

years must be say between A. D. 1660 and 1667 ( the date of Bernier's

These Pandits of Benares were all of them contemporaies of
Kavindra who was held in high esteem by Shah Jahan and his son
Dārā We must presume them to be living at the time Bernier visit-
ed Benares before A. D. 1667 when he wrote his letter from Shiraz in
Persia. It is possible to suppose that Bernier may have come into
contact at least with a few of them through' the Chief of Pandits at
Benares between A. D. 1656 and 1667.

record the names of these Pandits from whom he got his informa-
tion about Sanskrit learning.
I am concerned in this paper with the question of the identifi.
cation of the “Chief of the Pandits" at Benares described by Ber-
nier in the following extract from Bernier's letter of A. D. 1667
referred to above :-
"When going down the river Ganges, I passed through Bena.
res and called upon the chief of the Pandits, who resides in that
celebrated seat of learning. He is a Fakire? or Devotee so eminent
for knowledge that Chah Jehan, partly for that consideration and
partly to gratify the Rajas, granted him a pension of two thousand
roupies which is about one thousand crowns.
1. Possibly this Chief of the Benares Pandits is identical with
Kavindrācārya about whom M. M. Haraprasad Shastri writes as
follows:-
"He journeyed to Agra with a large following and proceeded to
the Diwan-i-am and there he pleaded the cause of the Hindu Pilgrims
with so much force of eloquence that all the noblemen of the Court
from Irak, Iran, Badak-Shan Balkh etc., were struck with wonder
Shah Jahan and Dara Shikoh relented and abolished the tax ( i. e.
the pilgrim tax). That was a day of great rejoicing throughout
Hindu India. It was on this occasion that the title of natanatyta
was conferred on him” - Indian Antiquary Vol. XLI, 1912, p. 11
( Vide p. iii of Introduction to Kavindra-Candrodaya ed. by Sharma
and Patkar).
2. In his Kavindrakalpadruma (India Office Cata. Part:VII,
No. 3947) Kavindra refers to his asceticism :-
"Seterağacı#TOTTEITTO Hà T: 1
ततः स्वीकृत्य संन्यासं ब्रह्माभ्यासं समाश्रितः।"
3. If this grant of a pension to Kavindra is confirmed by any
other independent testimony it would prove beyond doubt our
suggested identification of Kavindra with this Pandit. Kavindra,
though a Sanyasin as stated by himself in his 321-87297used to
distribute gold to learned Brahmins as stated in the Kavindra.
Candrod aya:- Page 53 -"graetari gadger and Page 41 "Ta
कविवरासि मोहरा जो असे प्रभुवरात मोहरा (i.e Kavindra distributed gold
Mohors to eminent poets). Evidently he used the royal patronage
from Shah Jahan and Dara for rewarding poets and learned Brabmins
though he himself was an ascetic. This reminds me of Kālidāša's
line " Ma Ágaraiath."

The foregoing contemporary tributes to Kavindra establish the
following points beyond doubt :-
(1) His contact with Shah Jahan's Court and other princes
(भूपाला : p. 8.)
(2) Title विद्यानिधान conferred on him by Shah Jahan (p. 5.)
(3) His all-sided learning and eminence acknowledged by
all contemporary Pandits of Benares.

one year he was in the constant habit of visiting my Agah,' to whom
he paid his court in the hope that he would exercise his influence

Oxford History of India by V. A. Smith, 2nd Edn. 1923). Dara was

monial.
3. The Editor of Bernier's Travels in footnote l'on p. 341
possibly identifies this University library with the College at Benares
maintained by Mirza Raja Jaisingh for the youth of good families.
Tavernier travelled with Bernier from Agra to Bengal in 1665 and
visited this college on 11th, 12th and 13th December 1665 ( Vide pp.
234-235 of Tavernier's Travels, Vol. II). In this connection I have
to point out that Kavindra had a Library of his own (See at Tato-
491454 published in the G. 0. Series (No. XVII), Baroda, 1921.
This Sūci or Catalogue was obtained from a Math at Bcoares (p. V
of Foreword). Dr. Ganganath Jha states that Kavindra was a Sanya-
sin and a rich man." It is surmised that this Library of Kavindra
was dispersed after the death of its owner, who being an ascetic had
no heirs. Several Kavindrācārya Mss are in the Oriental Institute,
Baroda. These Mss can be identified as they contain an endorse-
ment - "para entitarijaththaatai gf " on their covers.
The B. O. R. Institute contains a Ms of data of FATCA (No. 762 of
1891-95) with the above endorsement. The date of this Ms is
Samvat 1514 - A.D. 1458. The endorsemnt reads:-- "TATEETTTT7fà.
आचार्यसरस्वतीनां वेदान्ततत्वालोकः"
4. It may be possible to identify these Six Pandits with some of
the 69 admirers of Kavindra who have contributed their prašastis to
the Kavindra Candrodaya and who were contemporaries of both of
Kavindra and Bernier before A. D. 1667.

before the eyes that fixes the mind; but in fact we acknowledge that

ndra as revealed by the Kavindracandrodaya pertains to a period
of Shah Jahan's reign which ends with A. D. 1658. It will thus be
seen that, if we accept the identity of Bernier's Chief Pandit of
Benares with Kavindra, Bernier supplies to us a sort of supple-
ment to the information regarding Kavindra recorded in the Kavin.
dracandrodaya, the two contemporary sources thus revealing the
personality of this learned Sanyāsi in the proper historical pers-
pective. In fact no scholar has as yet identified Kavindra in any
other contemporary historical source and so far we are required to
to be content with the Praśastis as found in the Kavindracandro-
daya. We must, therefore, try to link up the two contemporary
sources to enable us to form a picture of Kavindra more full of
historical details than what it is at present in spite of the attempts

Kavindra or Acārya Kavindra was originally an inhabitant of
Punyabhūmi on the banks of the river Godāvari. He learnt the
Veda, the Vedāngas and other Sastras and later took to asceticism

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
de: When Shah tohaving taken Sanvien nood he lost his
and commenced meditation on Brahman. He had studied the
Ašvalāyana Sakha of Rgveda. In bis very childhood he lost his
interest in the world and having taken Sanyāsa he made Benares
his abode. When Shah Jahan levied the pilgrim tax on pilgrims
to Allahabad and Benares Kavindra, the acknowledged head of the
Pandits at Benares exercised his influence effectively on the
Mogol Emperor and made him abolish this tax. It was a joyous
occasion for the Hindu community in Benares who felt extremely
grateful to Kavindra for his miraculous influence with the Emperor
which was responsible for the removal of the tax for good. This
gratefulness is reflected in the tributes paid to Kavindra in the
Kavindra-Candrodaya. Kavindra was well versed in all branches
of Sanskrit learning. He appears to have had a fine collection of
MSS as proved by the Kavindra List published in the G.O. Series,
Baroda. In recongition of Kavindra's eminence in learning the
Emperor Shah Jahan conferred upon him the title Vidyānidhana or
Sarvavidyānidhāna as stated in the Kavindra-Candrodaya. Shah
Jahan had also given him a pension of Rs. 2000 but it was stopp-
ed by Aurangzeb as soon as he came to the throne in 1658–59.
Dārā Shikoh the eldest son of Shah Jabān who was a lover of
Hindu Philosophy had gathered many pandits round him. Kavindra
occupied the foremost place among these pandits and he was in-
cluded in Dārā's household as stated by Bernier.
After the deposition and imprisonment of his patron Shah
Jahần in A. D. 1658 the pension of Kavindra was stopped and this
misfortune, coupled with the execution of Dārā Shikoh in A. D.
1659 led Kavindra to seek a new patron viz. Danishmand Khan
who was a patron of Bernier the celebrated French traveller.
This patron had a soft corner for Dārā and his associates. It was
his voice alone that was raised against the capital sentence passed
on Dārā by a council of theologians. He entertained Kavindra in
his service for some years at the request of Bernier. Kavindra
wanted to use the influence of Danishmand Khân to renew the pen-
sion of Rs. 2000, stopped by Aurangzeb about A. D. 1659. How
far this attempt was successful we cannot say as we have no evi.
dence on the point. Danishmand Khan was, therefore, a common
patron of both Bernier and Kavindra after about A. D. 1658-
59 when the pataonage from Dārā and Shah Jahần given to
him came to an end. For three years. Kavindra was a constant
companion of Bernier and when Bernier paid a visit to Benares,
Kavindra received him warmly in the “University Library"
where he had invited six eminent Pandits to discuss many matters
of interest to Bernier. Bernier has given us in his letter of A. D.
1667 a detailed account of these discussions. What happened to

Kavindra after say A. D. 1667 is a matter for investigation but as
Danishmandkhān died in A. D. 1670 Kavindra must have been
left without any patronage.
The foregoing connected account of the career of Kavindra
between A. D. 1628 and 1667 is based on two contemporary
sources viz. (1) Bernier's letter of A. D. 1667 and Kavindra-
Candrodaya which was composed before A. D. 1658. It is also
based on my identification of Kavindra, the head of Benares
Pandits with the Chief of Benares Pandits mentioned and describ-
ed by Bernier. If my identification is accepted by scholars intere.
sted in the problem they would be curious to know something
about the common patron of Bernier and Kavindra viz. Danish-
mand Khân and record here some information about this Khan
as recorded by Bernier himself :-
Bernier states (on p. 4) that he was reduced to penury by
adventures with robbers and by the heavy expenses of the journey
of nearly seven weeks from Surat to Agra and Delhi. He accepted
a salary from the Great Mogol in the capacity of physician and soon
afterwards by chance he procured a salary from “ Danechmendkan'
(= Danishmand Khân) "the most learned man of Asia, formerly
Bakchis or Grandmaster of the Horse and one of the most power-
ful and distinguished Omrahs or Lords of the Court.''
On p. 100 Bernier states : “ Danechmand Khan although
he and Dara had long been on bad terms enforced this opinion
viz. that Dara should be taken to Gwalior with all his powers of
argument but it was ultimately decided that Dara should die.”
"Rouchenara Begam betrayed all her enmity against her helpless
brother combating the arguments of Danech.Mend and exciting
Aurnga. Zebe to this foul and unnatural murder."
On p. 186 Bernier informs us :- Danechmend-Kan was ap-
pointed Governor of Delhi and in consideration of his studious
habits, and the time which he necessarily devotes to the affairs of
1. Editor's footnote 2 reads :-"A Persian merchant by name
Muhammad Shafi, or Mullā Shafi. He came to Surat about the years
1646 from which place he was sent for by the Emperor Shah Jahan
who conferred upon him the command of 3000 men and made him
paymaster of the army ( Bakshi ) with the title of Danishmand Khăn
(Learned Knight). In the reign of Alamgir he received still further
promotion and was appointed Governor of ShahaJāhanabad or new
Delhi where he died in 1670."

the foreign department, he is exempted from the ancient cere-
mony of repairing twice a day to the assembly for the purpose of
saluting the king.”
On p. 352 Bernier in his letter of 14th December 1664 writes :
-"Besides my Navab or Agah Danechmend-Khan expects my
arrival with much impatience. He can no more dispense with
philosophical studies in the afternoon than avoid devoting the
morning to his weighty duties as Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs and Grand Master of the Horse. Astronomy, Geography
and Anatomy are his favourite pursuits and he reads with avidity the
works of Gassendi' and Descartes."
On page 414 – Danechmend-Kan made an attempt to induce
Bernier to renounce his religion by making him visit a place called
Baramoulay where he might bear testimony to a miracle and be a
convert to Muslim religion, but Bernier detected the cheating
process and ran away from the place.
The above remarks regarding his patron Danishmand Khân
made by Bernier make it abundantly clear that this Khān was a
very cultured man of literary abilities and attainments besides
being an influential person at the Mogol Court during the reigns
of Shab Jahān and Aurangzeb. It is therefore, no wonder that he
should patronize other devotees of learning like Bernier and the
Chief of the Benares Pandits whom I have identified with Sarva-
vi tyänidhana Kavindrācārya Sarasvati. It was the tie of learning
that brought together a Frenchman of Puris, a Muslim of Persia
and a Brahmin of Benares actuated by the only motive of exchange
of thought, which we value so so much in modern times and on
which depends all advancement of knowledge. As Danishmand
Khân died in 1670 A. D. Kavindra may have lost the patronage
he had been receiving from this Khân presuming that he survived
alter A. D. 1670, when he must have been a pretty old man. I
am, therefore, inclined to assign the life-period of Kavindra
between A. D. 1600 and 1675."

Travels ) Bernier owed his great powers of accurate observation to his
training under Gassendi, the French philosopher.

I have recorded the above entry from Aufrecht's catalogue
with a view to indicating what works have been attributed by
Auſrecht to Kavindācārya. It is not possible for me to examine
all the items of this entry by a personal access to the MSS recorded
by him. Such work must be left for future study but in the mean-
while I take this opportunity of requesting scholars interested in
this historic personality to throw more light on the problem of the
present study from any source whatsoever which would be helpful
either for contradicting my hypothesis os corroborating it on the
strength of contemporary evidence.

Vol. IV, No. 3, pp. 134-135, 1939 ).
1. Vide p. 71 of Cata. of Bikaner MSS by R. Mitra, Calcutta,
1880 - MS No. 179- The MS is described as “A commentary on
the 6th book of the शतपथब्राम्हण by कवीन्द्राचार्य सरस्वती" The extracts
given make no reference to कवीन्द्राचार्य.
2. Vide Burnell's Cata, of Tanjore MSS (1879), p. 1634 -
98154 This MS described in Des. Cata. of Tanjore MSS, Vol. VII,
1930, pp. 2893-96. The endorsement "paragraf 1970 lat
Fantat” indicates that the MS once belonged to Kavindra. The
year of the copy is 1650 ( Saka ? or Samvat?). If Samyat the year
would correspond to A. D. 1594. The author of the work is un-
known. Burnell's description" Hansadüta by Kavindrācārya
Sarasvati " is misleading as it is not a work of Kavindrācārya.

45. A Topical Analysis of the Bhojana-
Kutūhala, a Work on Dietetics, composed
by Raghunātha - Between A. D. 1675 & 1700 *
I have proved in a special paper' that Raghunatha, the author of a
work on dietetics called the Bhojana-Kutūhala, was a protégé of the
Queen Dipābāi, wife of Ekoji Bhosala of Tanjore, the step-brother
of Shivaji the Great. Raghunātha composed some Marathi works
at the instance of Queen Dipābāi. In one of his Marathi works
called the Narakavarnana he gives us a list of his Sanskrit works
in which we find two works viz.(1) धर्मामृतमहोदधि and (2) भोजनकुतूहल.
The Dharmāmſtamahodadhi was composed in A. D. 1701. The
Narakavarnana was composed between 1701 and 1712 A. D. The
Bhojanakutūhala was composed before A. D. 1700. As the author
of this work was a Mahārāştra Brahman he not only refers to the
Deccani dietetics but records and describes the dietetics of
other Indian provinces also at times. The B. O. R. Institute has
a Ms2 of the 1st Pariccheda of this work. With a view to facilitat.
ing a close study of this work it is necessary to acquaint interest-
ed scholars with its topics. I have, therefore, thought it fit to
record below the topics of the treatise as found in the Ms itself.
This Ms is No. 594 of 1899-1915 in the Govt. Mss Library at the
B. O. R. Institute. It is dated Saka 1723 = A. D. 1803.

46. Raghunātha, a Protégé of Queen Dīpābāi
of Tanjore, and his Works –
Between A. D. 1675-1712 *
Aufrecht' mentions an author of the name Raghunātha Sūri,
who composed a work on Dietetics called the Bhajana-kutūhala.
He mentions no other works of this author, though many other
namesakes? of Raghunātha and their works are recorded by
Aufrecht. I propose to examine in this paper the question of the
identity of some of these namesakes with Raghunātha Sūri, the
author of the Bhojana-kutūhala, with which I have dealt with else-
where.When I studied this work on dietetics I had no idea that
this author had composed any other works. Subsequently Mr. R.
Rangachariar published a paper“ on the Bhojana-Kutūhala in which
* Journal of the University of Bombay, (N. S.) Vol. X, Pt. 2,
pp. 132-140.
1. CC.1, 484 — "194194ft - Bhojana-Kutūhala.”
2. Ibid, pp. 483-486.
3. Annals ( B. O. R. Institute ), Vol. XXII, pp. 254-263.
4. Journal of S. M. Library, Tanjore, Vol. 1, No. 2 (1939–
1940), page 29 — Raghunathsūri and his Bhojana-Kutühala." Here
the Colophons of the भोजनकुतूहल and धर्मामृतमहादधि are recorded as
follows:
___ - " इति श्रीमद्विद्वद्वन्दवन्द्यपादारविन्दश्रीमदनन्तदेवोदयस्य रघुनाथविदुषः कृतौ

मदनन्तदेवोदयस्य रघुनाथविदुषः कृती धर्मामृतमहोदधिनिबन्धने गोदानविधिः"
Mr. Rangachariar identifies 37aa&a common to both the above
Colophons with अनन्तदेव, the author of the मीमांसान्यायप्रकाश, who "is
known to have flourished during the end of the 16th Century A. D."
The author of मीमांसान्यायप्रकाश was आपदेव and not अनन्तदेव. His genea-
logy is as follows :-

he disclosed another work of this auttor, viz., Dharmāmītamaho-
uudhi. This paper led me to an inquiry regarding any other
works of this author and the evidence for proving the identity of
the authors of these works with Raghunātha, the author of the
Bhojana-Kutuhala. Fortunately for my inquiry I was able to get
the necessary evidence to prove the authorship of several works
attributed to the namesakes of Raghunātha, the author of the
Bhojana-kutūhala. This evidence is as follows:-
Raghunātha, the author of the BK (= Bhojana-K'utūhala) took
to the composition of Marathi works after he had composed many
Sanskrit works as stated by him in his Marathi work Narakavar-
nana composed in Ovi metre. A MS of this work is available in
the Sarasvati Mahal Library at Tanjore.' In this work Raghunātha
not only claims the BK as his own work but also gives us a list of

Tepatu → 37190a (I) — 347779 (I) — 371999 (II) (A. D. 1600-1650)
→ Haraga ( a. of FaÏETH) (A. D. 1675-1700 ).
(Vide my paper on Apadeva in the F. W. Thomas Com. Volume).
If the statement of the colophon of EHIEDHETETA is correct we
must verify what para a is connected with Tap the author of the
BK and the STEHETETE.
Mr. Rangacha riar further observes :- "This Raghunāthasūri
appears to be a native of northern parts and a Maharatta for he
quotes Maharatta synonyms frequently in this work”. (i.e. 119-
5). These remarks are correct as will be seen from the Marathi
works of our author mentioned later in this paper.

chandrarao, 1929, p. 191 — No. 573 -71qu1a ga1988 - Tayt

तें तें सांगितले शुकें ॥ तें सर्वही दीपांबिके ॥ प्रति निरूपिलें रघुनाथ ॥४९॥"
Dipambikä asked Raghunātha to compose Marathi works for the
benefit of the masses who found Sanskrit difficult to understand
(#ena for FETTET ATT ). Raghunātha devotes in this work some Ovis
(55-67 ) to the eulogy of his patron दीपांबिका called दीपांबास्तवन. She was
a royal personage with three illustrious princes as her sons :-"ata
पुरुषार्थ तिघे भूप । जयेचे पुत्र कुलदीप । दीपांबिका यथार्थरूप । नाम म्हणौनि शोभतसे."

his earlier Sanskrit works. According to this list Raghunātha com-
posed the following works :-
(1) Bhojana-Kutahala, (2) Sahitya-Kutahala, (3) Prāya-
Ścitta-Kutūhala, (4) Janārdana-Mahodadhi, (5) Dharmāmſtama-
hodadhi, (6) Kasimimāmsa. The identity of the author of the Nara-
kavarnana, a Marathi work composed by Raghunatha, with his name-
sake, the author of the BK is clearly proved as the former men-
tions ihe BK as his own work in the Narakavarnana represented by
the Tanjore MS referred to above. We are thus in a position to
have reliable information regarding Raghunātha's literary activity
both in the Sanskrit and the Marathi fields as this information is
vouched by the statement of the author himself. In fact the list
of our author's works as recorded in the Narakavarnana is a key to
the author's literary career covering a period of at least one
decade, if not more. We must, therefore, see if we can trace MSS
of works mentioned in this list in the collections of various MSS
libraries in India. We must also identify the royal patron
Dipāmbikā who inspired Raghunātha to compose Marathi works' for
the benefit of the public who could not understand the difficult
Sanskrit language. It is for students of the history of Marathi
literature to trace the Marathi works of the author of the BK and

1. Ibid, p. 193 - Besides the Narakavarnana MS there are 2
MSS of a work called पतिव्रताधमे (on the duties of wives) in the
Tanjore Library vis., Nos. 578 and 579. I have no doubt that रघुनाथ
the author of this work is identical with the author of the नरकवणेन
and भोजनकुतूहल. On Folio 1 of MS No. 578 the author informs us:-
"समस्त जनांस उपकारक ।। हा मनों करूनिया विवेक । पाहोनिया पुराणश्लोक ॥ भाषा-
प्रबंध करीतसे." This work may have been composed earlier than the
नरकवर्णन which states that the author wrote on स्त्रीधर्म by order of
दीपांबिका:-"मग दीपांबिकेच्या वचनें ॥ प्राकृत सीधर्मकथनें."

nätha's works referred to above I must try to identify his royal
patron, viz., Dipámbika because this identification will alone give
us an exact chronology for the literary career of our author. In the
Marathi works of Reghunatha he refers to Dipāmbikä as follows:-
(१) नरकवर्णन - " तीन पुरुषार्थ तिघे भूप। जयेचे पुत्र कुलदीप ।
दीपांबिका यथार्थरूप । नाम म्हणोनि शोभतसे."
(२) पतिव्रताधर्म - " मग दीपांबिकेच्या वचनें । प्राकृत स्त्रीधर्मकथनें."
It is clear from the above references that Dipämbika was a queen
and she had three illustrious princes' as her sons (तिघे भूप कुलदीप.)
and hence the name दीपांबिका or the mother of these कुलदीपs was
significant. The queen Dipambikā mentioned by Raghunātha in
the two works in Marathi appears to me to be identical with the
queen Dipambikā, wife of Ekarāja (or Ekoji) step-brother of the
Maratha King Shivaji the Great. She has been mentioned in a
contemporary Sanskrit work called the Bhosalavamšāvalia in the
following verses :-
1. One of these three princes viz., Sarabhoji composed a maha.
kāvya called Raghavacarita (vide pp. 17ff of Tanjore Library Journal
Vol. I, No. 3). In the 10 introductory verses of this poem he refers to
his grandfather " TIETG" (v. 2), his father“ paroit" (v. 5 ) whom he
calls तजाधिप. He refers to his mother queen दीपांबिका and himself
and his elder brother Ter in verses 7, 8, 9, 10, which read as
follows :-
"विश्वभरोऽसाविह दीव्यतीति । स्वयं च लक्ष्मीरवार्य भूमौ ॥ दीपांविकेति प्रथिता
पति तम् । अविन्ददिन्दुं किल रोहिणीव ॥ ७॥ तस्यामजायन्त सुतास्त्रयोस्य । शस्त्रे च शास्त्रे

I have no doubt that the queen Dipāmbikā mentioned by Venkata-
bhațța in his account of the genealogy of the Bhosalas of Tanjore
is identical with Dipāmbikā the royal patron of Raghunātha, the
author of the BK. If this identification is accepted we must
regard Venkațabhatta as contemporary of Raghunātha because the
former composed his Bhosalavamśävali during the reign of Shahāji,
the son of Dipambikä and Ekoji' (or Vyankoji ) the step-brother of

1925, pp. 129-134. In the Intro. (p. 11 ) we are told by the Editors
that Venkatabhațţa composed the Bhosalavamśāvali during the reign
of Shahāji, son of Vyankoji (also called Ekoji or Ekarāja). The
author refers to the ancestors of Shivaji, viz., Ekoji, Parasoji,
Bābāji, Maloji and Shahāji and then deals with Shivāji and his step-
brother Ekoji. In verse 16 Shivaji is called as the very incarnation
of God Śiva - "Tags: fira ga ATATT."
1. According to Sabhasad Bakhar (composed A. D. 1697) pp.

bika. The Jedhe Chronology refers to the meeting of Shivaji with
Ekoji in Saka 1599 ( = A. D. 1677) in the month of Srāvana and the
defeat of Ekoji by Shivaji in the month of Kārtika of the same year
(vide pp. 28-29 of Siva-Caritrapradipa). The poet Jayarāma Pindye
in his Parnālaparvatagrahaņākhyāna composed in Saka 1595 (A. D.
1673 ) refers to Ekoji as “CHAEOT. ” (1.3) and his “sirfiiagra"
assembly hall at Bangalore (aastCTATI). In this poem Jayarāma
gives Ekoji an account of his elder brother's (Shivaji's ) exploits. In
1, 51, .Shivaji is called " ETSTESTET.' Jayarama has given us an
account of the life of Shahaji in his Rådhâmadhavavilāsa Campū
(composed about A. D. 1653-58 ). In this poem one TEFTTY HE 27552T
is mentioned ( p. 230 of Rajawade's Edn. ) as also one TITAT OTA (p.
245). On p. 267 g TTAT or Ekoji is mentioned along with his mother

Shivaji the Great. Ekoji was the founder of the Maratha rule at
Tanjore.' He ruled from A. D. 1676-83. At the time of his death
in A. D. 1683 Ekoji was only 54 years old. Shivaji's expedition
into the Carnatic to claim his share of his father's jahagir from
Ekoji, the husband of Dipămbikā, took place in A.D.1676-77. Ekoji
left three sons: (1) Shahaji. (2) Sarabhoji, and (3) Tukkoji.
These sons ruled jointly.' Shahaji died heirless in A. D. 1712
at the age of forty. After him Sarabhoji ruled jointly with
Tukkoji till his death in A. D. 1728. Tukkoji succeeded
Sarabhoji as sole ruler in A. D. 1728 and ruled till his death in
A. D. 1736.
In view of the above chronology of the three illustrious sons
of Dipambika we must put A. D. 1736 as the later limit for Raghu.
nātha Sûri, the author of the BK. As the husband of Dipāmbika died
in A. D. 1683 and as Raghunātha refers to her and her three sons as
Kings (498) I presume that Raghunātha composed the Marathi
works when all these three sons were living. As Sarabhoji died
in A. D. 1712 the later limit to Raghunatha's vorås will be about
A.D. 1700 while the earlier limit may be about A.D. 1676 the year
of Ekoji's capture of Tanjore. Perhaps he may have migrated to
Tanjore about this time from the Mahārāşțra to seek patronage of
the Tanjore rulers and their accomplished queens and mistresses."

the Tanjore inscription in Marathi which dates this death in Saka

period. Translations, panegyrics and a few original works con-
stitute the legacy in this field. The Deccan was the chief source
of Marathi literature of Tanjore." ?
I am of opinion that the literary career of Raghunātha, the
author of the BK, was synchronous with the first half of Shahaji's
reign. He was under the patronage of Shahāji's mother and we
must assign him to a period between A. D. 1650 to 1700..
We shall now consider the different works of Raghunātha in
the order in which he mentions them in his Marathi work Naraka-
varpana.

called Firetrage with a commentary
35628981 by ferfer (I. Q. 1616 fr.).
Raghunatha states in his Narakavarnana that he composed a
work called साहित्यकुतहल and that it was devoted to चित्ररचना only (दुजे

the title areegala and its subject matter is also fazania or
artificial poetry and the different modes of its construction such as
quay, 5*, patate, etc., as stated in the I. O. Catalogue. It is
however, difficult to prove the identity of Teftart with gater in
spite of the similarity of subject-matter and the identity of the
titles of this work, viz., art .

The statement of Raghunatha, viz., " जनार्दन महोदय आधी" in
the list of the works composed by him is probably a misreading for
the correct title of his work "जनार्दनमहोदधि" because in the next
line he refers to a similar title of his work, viz , "धर्मामृतमहोदधि."

If the date of composition of this work, viz., Saka 1623 ( = A.

we shall have to adjust the chronology of other works of Raghu-

its date must lie between A. D. 1701 and 1712.

Apart from the five Sanskrit works attributed to Raghunatha
recorded above, out of which four appear to have been represented
by MSS, he mentions that he wrote some Marathi works viz. :-

of this work.
(ii) स्त्रीधर्मकथने - Possibly same as पतिवताधर्म represented by
two MSS in Tanjore Library.
(iii) नरकविषयविवेचन - Same as नरकवर्णन of which only one MS
is found in the Tanjore Library. As this work gives us a list of
the author's works in Sanskrit and Marathi it is very important.

The Chronogram recorded above gives us Saka 1623 = A. D. 1701
as the date of composition or rather the completion of the work as
stated in the above Catalogue. If this date is genuine the relative
position of Raghunatha's works will be as follows:-
Tauta Before A. D. 1712 and after A. D. 1701 as it mentions
all the three sons of Dipābai as living. One of these
song, viz., Shahaji died in A. D. 1712. It mentions
YaqaHeig, composed A. D. 1701.
HAETERE - A. D. 1701 ( if the date recorded in the only

In my recent papers' on Raghunātha a Protégé of Queen Dipă.
bäi of Tanjore I have recorded an account of the several Sans-
krit and Marathi works of this author on the basis of several MSS
in our MSS Libraries. This account has also shown the following
particulars about this author:
(1) He went to Tanjore and composed some works under the
patronage of Queen Dipäbãi possibly after the death of Ekoji
Bhosale, her husband, the founder of the Tanjore Kingdom. Ekoji
died in A. D. 1683.
(2) He was the pupil of Anantadeva, the author of Smyti-Kau-
stubha and other works on Dharmaśāstra.
(3) He was a Mahārāşğra Brahmin.
(4) He composed Sanskrit works like the भोजनकुतुहल, प्रायश्चित्त-
are etc. as stated by him in his Marathi work 770ia, a Ms of
which has been preserved in the Tanjore Mss Library.

the celebrated author of Smyti. Kaustubha and other works on Dha-

the writing of Marathi works under the patronage of queen Dipa-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
A. D.
1674 - It appears from Ramadasa's letter to Raghunatha (=R)
that R was already a middle-aged person in A. D. 1674.
This inference is consistent with the epithet qtogarar
used by H T Tiereft in his letter ( No. 51 )of A.D. 1682.
Rwas also reputed to be a man of considerable learning
at this time. Most probably he composed his works
HISTAFE and stafarroa etc. before A.D.1674 or so.'
1650-1675 – Literary activity of waraa the Guru of R.
1674 - Shivāji's Coronation at Raigad.
1676-77. Shivaji's expedition into the Carnatic.
1676 - Ekoji Bhosale, the step-brother of Shivaji, captures
Tanjore.
1679 - R was residing at Chafal, the headquarters of Rāmadā sa.
In this connection I may state that the temple of ritgara
was built at Chafal in Saka 15702 = A. D. 1648 and
Shivaji came to Chafal and met Ramadāsa in A. D. 1649.
If these facts are reliable we may conclude that R was
appointed उपाध्याय and पुराणीक at Chafal temple some-
time about or after A. D. 1648 and was given the inām at
faciat subsequently. R enjoyed this inām upto A. D.
1683, when he relinquished his duties at Chafal as also
the inām in favour of his son-in-law भैरवभट महाबलेश्वरकर.
1. I have come across a rare MS of the gasa (1st pari-
ccheda ) which is a contemporary copy of the work belonging to
Syamji Nayak Punde and bears his endorsement 'शामजी नायकपुण्डयो-
qaraig.' Syamji Nayak was the Maratha Subhedar of Karnatak
about A. D. 1682. The B. B. R. A. S. Ms (No. 618 ) of graphers is
' at least 300 years old ' according to Prof. H. D. Velankar. If this
statement is correct the B.B.R.A.S. Ms No. 618 will be another con-
temporary copy of Raghunātha's work. Both these contemporary
Mss lead me to infer that the भोजनकुतूहल and प्रायश्चित्तकुतहल were
composed by Raghunātha say between A. D. 1650 and 1675.

ple of Raghupati was built at Chafal by Saint Ramadāsa upto A.D.
1712, when Shahāji, the son of Dipăbăi died at Tanjore. This life-
history is mainly divided into 2 periods : 1. Life-history before
Raghunātha's pilgrimage to Benares in A. D. 1683 and 2. that bet-
ween A. D. 1683 and 1712. The first period pertains to Raghu-
nátha's contact with and training under Anantadeva, the great-
grandson of Saint Ekanātha of Maharashtra as also his contact with
Saint Ramadāsa say, between 1648 and 1682 A. D., the year.of

rashtra after Shivāji's death in A. D. 1680 as also the demise of

Saint Ramadāsa must have led Raghunatha to undertake the Maha
yatra and after its completion to migrate to Tanjore, where con-
ditions of life were more favourable for learned pandits requiring
means of livelihood and peaceful atmosphere for their spiritual
and academic pursuits. Queen Dipābāi, the able administrator of
Tanjore during her son's rule ( A. D. 1684-1712 ) was a pious lady
who appears to have gathered round her learned pandits of high
character like Raghunātha Ganesa Navahasta, who by his deep
learning and personal contact of many years with the premier Saint
of Maharashtra must have been highly respected by the Queen
Mother Dipābāi and her three illustrious sons to whom Raghunatha
refers as follows in his Narakavarnana :-
"तीन पुरुषार्थ तिघे भूप
जयेचे पुत्र कुलदीप।
दीपांबिका यथार्थरूप

”
We have already noted that Raghunatha's daughter was married
to Bhairava Bhat, the son of Divakara Gosavi and that in A.D. 1683
Raghunatha relinquished his duties as 397E914 and grroira at Chafal
Math in favour of his son-in-law Bhairava Bhat. The original
surname of Bhairava Bhat's family was HETTATO but since he be-
came the 3977ta of Chafal Math the original surname was changed
and at present the descendants of Bhairava Bhat are called by the
surname 39147. The genealogy of this family has been recorded
by Mr. S. S. Dev but he nowhere gives us the genealogy' of
Raghunatha Navahasta, the author of Bhojana.kutūhala and other
works. Whether Raghunatha had any male issue is doubtful but
it is possible to investigate the genealogy of his family. His sur-
name was नवहस्त which is equal to नवाथे or नवाथ्ये, a surname cur-
rent among the Karhada Brahmins of Maharashtra at present. I
understand that there is a family of Navathes ( Karhada Brahmins )
at Dhavadshi near Satara. The gotra of this family is also afhTB
which is identical with that of Raghunatha Navahasta mentioned
many times in contemporary documents. If Raghunatha Nava-
hasta was a Karhada Brahmin, the marriage of his daughter with
Bhairava Bhat Mahabalesvarkar, who is obviously a Desastha Brah.

Raghunatha Navahasta among the extant Navathe families in the
different parts of Maharashtra,

title “TICHETU" was probably a misreading for “ garen.
HETCIE” which is the name of a work recorded by Aufrecht.*
Secondly Raghunātha composed a work called “higa FEIERT"
which he mentions in his list of works referred to above. Since
expressing this view my friend Pandit Raghunatha Shastri Patankar
of Rajapur has sent to me his own article on Raghunātha Ganesa
Navahasta published by him in 1931 in a Marathi journal“ (now
stopped ) together with an actual MS of Far ETH EICH, now the
property of the Sanskrit Pāțhaśālā at Rajapur. This MS has been
briefly described by Pandit Raghunātha Shastri in his Marathi
article under reference but for the benefit of the students of the
history of Sanskrit literature I must present a critical analysis of
it, especially because the work is unknown to Aufrecht's Cata-
logus Catalogorum. I am thankful to Pt. Patankar for sending me
the MS of FAIDAHEREU and also for drawing my attention to his
article referred to above.
This MS of Janārdana-mahodaya ( = JM) belongs to the
collection of MSS acquired by the above Pathashala from Pandit

which contains the text with the comm. सनाभि by ज्योतिर्विद्राय दाजी

There are two MSS of this text in the Govt. MSS Library but they
are late copies prepared in Saka 1789 = A. D. 1867. This HIEFFU is
ascribed to Vedavyasa. It describes the holy places of Kolhapur.

BTUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HİBTORY
The MS is.incomplete and we have no means of knowing the
number of chapters it contained originally.
The foregoing analysis of the available sections of the MS
before us gives us the following particulars about the work and its
author :-
(1) The title of tlic work is 7TTCHETTA as stated in the several
colophons recorded in the work. This title exactly tallies with
that mentioned by the author in his list of self-composed
works found in the Marathi work नरकवर्णन.
(2) The author of the work JM is रघुनाथ, pupil of अनंतदेव,
the great writer on dharmaśāstra who composed gritty and
other works in the middle of the 17th century.
(3) In addition to the identity of the name tears, the author
of the JM, and his guru's name hacer as also the identity of the
name of the work viz. FICTAEA which he claims as his own
work we find close parallelism of expression in the introductory
and closing verses of the जनार्दनमहोदय and प्रायश्चित्तकुतूहल which read
as follows:
The section on 381ia ends :-
"अवादीत्थमनन्तेन गुरणा करुणाधिना ।
आचारगोचरं प्रायश्चित्तं तत्र निरूपितम् ॥"
Compare JM:-
" अवादीत्थमनन्तेन शिष्टजनतुष्टये।
प्रातःकृस्याधनुष्ठानं तेन तुप्यतु मत्प्रभुः ॥"
Compare again प्रायश्चित्तकुतूहल (ending verse):-
" pateignasa a integHATI
प्रायश्चित्तविधिहौभ्य संसंक्षेपोधिरूढतः ॥"
(4) Irrespective of the above proofs regarding the identity
of authorship we can say that the work JM represented by the big
fragment before us was composed later than c. A. D. 1630 as it
refers to HEITTEITA (on folio 19 of the first Chapter). I have
proved elsewhere that Bhattoji Dikşita flourished between A. D.
1560 and 1620 and consequently the reference to Bhattoji in the
JM clearly proves that the JM is later than a. A. D. 1630.
Raghunatha Gaņeśa Navahasta, the author of several works in
Sanskrit and Marathi flourished between A. D. 1640 and 1712
or so.

(5) As the title starTHETET indicates and as the contents of
its fragment before us prove the JM is a sort of manual of Vaişņa-
vite ritual and worship. In the 3rd section of the MS we find
some matter on the worship of I# and TATT. The material for
Rāma worship is introduced by our author with the following
verse on follio 42:-
“अथातः संग्रवक्ष्यामि नानायन्त्राणि मन्त्रिणां ।
नानाथदानि रामस्य नानाकल्पागमात् पृथक् ॥"
Then again the incomplete material in this section about
EHHI ( folios 125 - 129 ) is also important in view of the life-long
devotion of Saint Rāmadāsa for Rama and Hanūmān. I have proved
in a special paper the contact of our author with Saint Rāmadāsa
between A. D. 1648 and 1682, the year of Saint Rāmadāsa's death.
(6) Students of Saint Rāmadāsa's literary biography should
investigate the influence exercised by this learned Sanskrit Pandit,
the author of the JM, on Rāmadāsa's writings and teachings say
between A. D. 1648 and 1682. In a complete edition' of Rāma-
dāsa's works we find the following sections :--
(1) TTATGT ( Pages 494 – 593).
(2) stragantafi JAIETE (p. 388) dealing with the
manner in which the Rāmanavami festival should be
celebrated.
(3) Aitatat sejar (p. 631 ) or a prayer to God Māruti or
Hanūmān.
(4) Harê gia (pp. 593 - 605). These Slokas are very
popular in Mahārāşțra as they contain spiritual advice
saturated with devotion to Rāma.
(5) IHTIN (pp. 605-608). Stanzas emphasizing the
value of 717 71A.
(7) In Rāmadāsa's lettera dated A. D. 1674 to Raghunatha,
the author of the JM and other works, Rāmadāsa calls Raghunātha
"aa'' or“ all-knowing' and further shows his extreme con-
fidence in Raghunātha by identifying himself with his learned
friend ("anes TET BIE 73 Hare BIE"). We have, there-

STUDIBB IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
fore, reason to believe that the constant presence of such an inti.
mate pandit by the side of this illustrious Sajnt of Mahārāştra
must have wielded considerable influence on Râmadāsa's writings.
At any rate the material regarding # and TATTI worship in the
fragment of the JM before us leads me to infer that it is a con-
necting link between the author of the JM and his saintly friend
Rāmadāsa. If this suggestion is accepted the date of composi-
tion of the JM may be taken to be earlier than A. D. 1682, the
year of Rāmadāsa's death.
(8) The material incorporated in the JM about the goddess
HEISERT of salt or Kolhapur is also important. Raghunātha was
a Karhāļa Brāhmin of the surname aasta (or gate) of Vasiştha
Gotra as I have shown already.' The goddess Helgear of Kolhapur
is the family deity of the Karhāda Brahmins in Mahārāştra. This
fact explains why Raghunatha has thought fit to incorporate in his
JM the material about the goddess महालक्ष्मी of करवीर or Kolhapur.
(9) M. M. Prof. P. V. Kane does not mention the JM in his
History of Dharmaśāstra? though he mentions other works of Raghu-
nātha and deals with the works of his guru 37asa in a special
Section (No. 109 ) and assigns his literary activity to the "third
quarteỊ of the 17th Century" i. e., between A. D. 1650 and 1675.
This periodº is consistent with the chronology of his pupil Raghu-
nātha, the author of the JM represented by the big fragment of
MS analysed by me in this paper.
· I now close this paper with a request to scholars in Mihā-
rāșțra and outside that they should try to trace a completo MS of
he Fanārdana-mahodaya of Raghunātha Gaņeśa Navahasta.

49. A Contemporary Manuscript of the
Bhojana - Kutūhala of Raghunātha
belonging to Śāmji Nāyak Punde —
Between A. D. 1650 and 1685 *
Recently I published some papers' on the life and works of
Raghunātha, the author of a work on dietetics called the Bhojana-
Kutūhala. As a result of my investigation I have been able to
prove on contemporary evidence the following facts about the
life-history and chronology of this Deccani author :-
(1) The full name of this author was Raghunatha Ganesa
Navahasta; (2) He was the Upadhyāya of the Chafal Matha of Saint
Ramadasa between about A. D. 1648 and 1683 ; (3) He was a
very intimate friend of Saint Rāmadāsa as we find from a letter
addressed to him by this Saint ;( 4 ) In A. D. 1683 he renounced
all his property in the Satara District in favour of his son-in-
law Bhairavabhat and then proceeded on a mahāyātrā or pil.
grimage ; (5) He later migrated to Tanjore and composed some
Sanskrit and Marathi works under the patronage of Queen Dipā-
bãi the wife of Ekoji Bhosale, the brother of Shivaji the Great,
between A. D. 1683 and 1712 or 30; (6) During his stay in Mahā-
ſāştra he was the pupil of Anantadeva, the author of the Smſti-
Kaustubha. Raghunātha's Bhojana-Kutūhala was most probably
composed in Mahārāştra prior to his mahāyātrā of A. D. 1683.
Since the publication of my papers my friend Rajavaidya
S. A. Jagtap of Kolhapur sent me a bundle of MSS of Raghu-
nātha's Bhojana-Kutūhala. These MSS may be briefly described

1. The Bhojana-Kutühala is found in the list of works under-
taken for the G. O. Series, Baroda. Mr. B. V. Bhat, Secretary, Raja-
wade Samshodhan Mandir, Dhulia, also intends to edit the work with
a Marathi translation.
2. Kesava Pandita compiled a work on Dharmasastra called धर्म-
कल्पलता for King Sambhaji, Son of Shivaji the Great. A portion of
this work called satiatur is preserved in the Tanjore MSS Lib-
rary (MS. No. 536). This copy was made for Shamji Nayak Punde
in the year दुंदुभि which corresponda to A. D. 1682-83 ("शके राज्या-
भिषेकीये दुंदुभसंवत्सरे लिहमिदं पुस्तकम्"). The copy contains the following
endorsement :-" दण्डनीतिव्यवहारमजरी श्रीशामजीनायक पुंड्योपनानां ग्रंथः पत्र-
TT 39 11." This endorsement is identical with that on the Jagtap
Ms of the 1st Pariccheda of Raghunātha's work described above.
The identity of endorsements regarding the ownership of the copies
of भोजनकुतूहल and दण्डनीतिव्यवहारमन्जरी leaves no doubt about the con-
temporary nature of these copies.

a definitely prove that he flourished after A. D. 1600.' This
earlier terminus further supports my chronology for Raghunātha,
viz. between A. D. 1640 and 1712 or so to which I have referred
in my earlier papers on him. I am, however., mainly concerned
in this paper with the MS of the 1st Pariccheda of the 1977
belonging to Sāmji Nāyak Punde, about whom my friend Mr. V.S.
Bendre has supplied to me the following historical information:-
The Puņde family belonged to Sbrigonde village in the
Ahmadnagar District of the Bombay Presidency. Sesavvá Naik
Punde of this family was contemporary of Māloji Bhosle, the
grandfather of Shivaji the Great. His son Babāji Naik Punde
was Shivaji's l’akil at the Bijapur Court but was recalled from that
Court in November December 1673. Bābāji Naik died beween July
and November 1675. Bābāji's son Shāmji Naik Puņde was Potdar
(Treasurer ) of Shivaji. He accompanied Shivaji in his Karnāṭak
expedition. Later in December 1680 Shāmji was sent to Karnatak
under Ilarji Mahādih in charge of the Karnātak province. Shāmji
left Räigad for Karnātak in March 1681 but was arrested at Jinji
under the orders of Sambhāji, son of Shivaji, in August 1681.
In view of the above information about Shâmji Naik Punde
we may suppose that the MS of the 1st Pariccheda of the Bhojana-
Kutūhala belonging to this Marath: officer was copied for him
sometime prior to A. D. 1681 - 82 or in this very year, when
another MS, viz , that of yozatra TTTTTTT was copied for him in
the year as proved by the Tanjore MS of this work. It seems
certain, however, that Raghunātha composed this work in Mahā.
rāștra prior to A. D. 1680 or so when he was under the influence of
his guru Anantadeva, the author of the Smặtikaustubha. The three
Paricchedas of the Bhojana-Kutūhala clearly show that our author
had made a very close study of the Dharmaśāstra literature possi.
bly under the guidance of Anantadeva, who was the direct descen.
dant of the Maratha Saint Ekanāth ( 1528 - 1600 A. D.)2 ; and who
flourished in the “ 3rd quarter of the 17th Century," i. e., between
A. D. 1650 and 1675. This period is synchronous with the period
of Raghunātha's stay in Mahārāştra and his contact with Saint
Rāmadāsa as I have already shown in my papers. Whatever be the

exact date of composition of the Bhojana Kutūhala the association
of the Jagtap MS of the 1st Pariccheda of this work with Shamji
Nāyak Punde, a Maratha oflicer of Shivaji and Sambhaji, say bet-
ween A. D. 1650 and 1685, clearly proves that this MS is a con-
temporary copy and hence extremely important both from the his-
torical and textual points of view as will be seen from the facts
noted below:
(1) The B. O. R. Institute MS of the 1st Pariccheda of the
757a ( No. 594 of 1899-1905 ) is dated A. D. 1803. On folio
45a of this MS we find the following verse about the properties
of the Custard-apple or ffar90:-
"सीताफलं सुमधुर सीतलं पित्तनाशनं ।
सुपक्वरुचिकृताते हितं न कफकृत् परं ॥ सिताफळ ॥"
When I read this verse I was under the impression that the Sita-
phal or Custard-Apple was known to Raghunātha (c. A. D. 1650).
I now find that this verse is missing in the Shamji Nayak Puņde's
MS of the HT.TET. It appears therefore, that the above verse
was added to this work by some Vaidya during the Peshwa period
when the Sitāphal had gained sufficient popularity in the Deccan.
I have projected a special paper on the history of Sitāphal
from Indian sources. In this connnection I obtained the following
remarks from the Horticulturist to Government, Bombay, through
the favour of Mr. B. Suhay, l. C. S., Secretary of the Imperial
Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi, in May 1942:-
“ Sitäphai and Ramphal — The names of the two varieties of
Custard Appis, Rāmphal and Sitāphal are in themselves almost
enough to show that from very early times, the trees have been
grown and honoured by the Hindus."
This view about the antiquity of Sitāphal and Rāmphal is not
warranted by any evidence from Indian sources prior to A. D.
1500 or so as I propose to show in my projected paper on this sub-
ject referred to above.
(2) In the B. O. R. Institute MS of A. D. 1803 we find
the following verse about the properties of Orqaror papayā fruit :-
Folio 46 -
" वातकुभफलं ग्राही कफवातप्रकोपनं ।
तदेव पकं मधुरं पित्तनं रोचनं गुरु ॥ पोपया इति ॥"

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The above verse is found in the Jagtap MS of A. D. 1851
(Šaka 1773) and reads as follows :-
Folio 396 -
" वातकुंभफलं पाहि कफवातप्रकोपनं ।
तदेव पक्कं मधुरं पित्तघ्नं रोचनं गुरु ॥ पोपये ॥"
The above verse regarding Papaya found in the MSS of A. D.
1803 and 1851 is missing in the contemporary MS of Shamji Nayak
Punde's ownership.
The Horticulturist to Government, Bombay, makes the fol.
lowing remarks about Papaya :-
" Papaya -- It was introduced into India by the Portuguese.
Since Papayā seeds were sent from India to Naples, it is believed
that the plant must have been introduced into India at an early
date or shortly after the discovery of America."
(3) In the B. O. R. Iastitute MS of A. D. 1803 we find the
following verse regarding the properties of the fruit gaat or
pine-apple :-
Folio 40 -
"आमं तु कौतुकं रुण्यं कफपित्तकर गुरु ।
अन्नप्ररोचक हा श्रमलमनिबर्हणं ।।
Jei a fouTT TATATEI997 li sarah 11"
The above verse is found in the Jagtap MS of A. D. 1851 and
reads as follows :-
Folio 36a
"भामंतु केतकं रुच्यं कफपित्तकरं गुरु ।
अन्नप्ररोचकं हृष्यं श्रमक्लमनिबर्हणं ॥
पकं तु पित्तहृत् स्वादु रसमातपहोपनुत् । "
The above verse regarding Ananas is missing in Shāmji Nāyak
Punde's MS of the भोजनकुतूहल.
The Horticulturist to Government, Bombay, makes the fol.
lowing remarks about Ananas ;-
Ananas -- It is a native of Brazil. It was introduced by the
Portuguese into Bengal in 1594. Its introduction is particularly
mentioned by Indian authors such as Abul Fazl,"

Page 464****************************************************************************************
MANUSCRIPT OF BHOJANA-KUTOHALA OF RACHUNÄTHA 33
From a comparison of the Shāmji Nāyak Punde MS of about
A. D. 1680 with the late MSS of A. D. 1803 and 1851 of the 1st
Pariccheda of the stars we see that the verses regarding
(1) Sitāphal, (2) Ananas and (3) Papaya found in the 1803
and 1851 copies are exactly missing in the contemporary copy of
c. A. D. 1680. These omissions are not a mere matter of accident
especially when Raghunātha, the author of this work on dietetics,
has taken special care in recording the properties of all important
articles of diet known to him as current in the Deccan in the 17th
century. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that the
Custard- Apple, the Pine-apple and Papayā were not so popular in
his time as to find a mention in his treatise specially devoted to
dietetics. At any rate the ommission of these late additions to
Indian materia medica in a treatise of c. A. D. 1650 represented by
a contemporary copy before us is quite significant and convincing
regarding their late character and popularity. We have, however,
reason to believe that Saint Rāmadāsa, the friend of Raghunātha,
was quite acquainted with the fruits Añjira, Papayā, Sitāphal,
Ananas, etc.'
It appears, however, that the Chillies ( or Miraci ) had become
current in the Deccan in the 17th century. The Bhojana - Kutū.
hala MS of Shāmji Nāyak Punde contains the following verse
regarding them :-
Folio 55 -
"मरीचं क्षुपज रुच्यं दोषलं सर्वरोगकृत् ।
विशेषतः प्रमेहार्मोविकारेषु न शस्यते ॥ मिरसेंगा।"
The term “ ATAT" for Chillies is even now current in some
parts of the Konkan and I'shall prove in a separate paper on the
history of Chillies that this term was applied to Chillies after their
introduction into India in the Maratha Country. At any rate the
1. Vide p. 410 of 99605 of ITIACHIaft #faat (First Edition,
Dhulia, Saka 1830 = A. D. 1908 ). In the Section 4929770 we find
the following references :-"Braet grat aft,'"agtige BiHITT.”
In the बागप्रकरण (pp. 627-628 of रामदासाचे समग्र ग्रंथ by G. G.
Gondhalekar, Poona, 1906), we have an exhaustive list of plants to be
planted in the garden. In this list there are references to 999,
efetto, faarna and Bare as follows :-"194, as, a977," "ata, faz,
state, estarnia," "sta, WTA, TT&TT." The above references, are
historically important presuming that the texts in which they occur
are genuine works of Saint Rámadása.

mention of " for TT " and their properties in the Shāmji Nāyak
Puņde's MS of the Bhojana-Kutühala of c. A.D. 1650 proves
beyond doubt the antiquity of about 300 years for the term
"TOTT."
The Horticulturist to Government, Bombay, makes the fol.
lowing remarks about Chillies :-
"The introduction of Chillies is believed to be of recent date,
having been brought by the Portuguese from West Indies. Hove
alludes to Capsicum as growing in Bombay in 1887."
Evidently the reference to ATA or Chillies and its proper-
ties by Raghunātha, a Deccani author of the Satara District of the
Bombay Presidency about A. D. 1650, proves their popularity and
cultivation in the Deccan about this time, if not many years earlier.
This popularity has increased by leaps and bounds during the last
300 years. In fact at the present time the foreign origin of Chillies
is absolutely forgotten by Indians. During the latter half of the
18th Century the Chillies had already captured the palate of the
Marathas as stated by Rāghava Apā Khāņdekar' in the following
verse in bis Sanskrit anthology (c. A. D. 1800):
“FAT fare पाको मरहट्टानां कचिन रुचिदोऽस्ति"

50. Samudra - Sangama, a Philosophical Work
by Dara Shukoh, Son of Shah Jahan,
Composed in A. D. 1655*
Beale in his Oriental Biographical Dictionary' states that Dara
Shukoh was the author of "a work entitled Majma'-ul-Bahrain
(i. e. the uniting of both Seas) in which he endeavours to reconcile
the Brāhman religion with Muhammadan, citing passages from the
Qurān to prove the several points. In 1656 he likewise with the
same intent caused a Persian translation to be made by the Brāh-
mans of Banāras of the Anikhat a work in the Sanskrit language
etc.”
In Aufrecht's Catalogous Catalogorum there is only one MS
recorded of a work called Samudra-Sangama? which is identical
with Ms No. 1043 of 1891-95 in the Govt. MSS Library at the
B. O. R. Institute, Poona. The title " Samudra-Sangama" cos.
responds to the “uniting of both Seas" or Majma'-ul-Bahrain
referred to above. Most probably the Samudra-Sangama is a Sans-
krit adaptation of the Persian work of a similar title mentioned
by Beale.
* B. I. S. Mandal Quarterly, Vol. 24 ( 1943), pp. 75-88.
1. New Edition, London, 1894, p. 117 - article on Dara Shukoh.
The Chronology of Dara's life as found in this article is as follows:
Dara, born - 20th March 1615 ( 29th Safar, A. H. 1024).
His marriage -- A. D. 1633 ( A. H. 1043).
Battle between Dara and Aurangzeb - 29th August 1659 ( 2180
Zil-hijja A. H. 1069 ).
Dara caused the Upanishads to be translated by Benares Pandits
-A. D. 1656.
2. A work of this name is recorded by Poleman in his list of
Indic MSS in U.S. A. ( 1938 ) as follows:
Page 277 - MS No. 5463 HYEHTA ( by fat97 ? ) Cosmology, 144 ff.
8.25 ~ 4.75 (Harward 1212).
Perhaps this is identical with Dara's work FASHTA.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Prof. Kathawate who acquired the MS of the Samudra-San-
gama for the Govt. of Bombay in 1891 has described its contents
in detail in his Report' for 1891-95 and hence I need not deal with
them in this paper: I shall only discuss here the date of composi-
tion of the work in question as recorded in our MS No. 1043 of
1891-95 which begins as follows:-
"॥ सर्वत्र प्रकटः स सर्वावभासः स आदिः सोतस्तदतिरिक्तं वस्तु नास्तीति
प्रतिवेशी सवासी च सहगः सर्वमेव सः पटच्चरे दरिद्रस्य क्षौमे राज्ञः सर्वतः भाति संस-

कास्मवादतात्पर्य आसाथ" etc.
It appears from the above passage that महम्मद दाराशुको, who is
described by the adjectives "वीतराग," " विगतशोकसंदेह," is the
author of the present work. One ararre is mentioned in line 6
on folio 10 of the MS. He appears to be some contemporary mys-
tic and perhaps a guru2 of Dara Shukoh as he is reverently men-
-
1. Published at Bombay, 1901, Pages 18-20.
2. On folio 7a Dara refers to some Muslim Saints and divines
as follows :-

(2) the Author (Gratis AETHT FITigant) was running the
42nd year of his life.
(3) The present MS was completed in Samvat 1765, in the
dark fortnight of the month of Märgaširşa on the 7th
tithi which was a Monday (day of Candra ).'
The Hijra year ( 1065) was completed on 20th October 16552
and hence we must infer that the work was composed subsequent
to this date. Dara was born on 29 Safar 1024 A. H. (20th March
1615 A. D.).' According to the method of calculating age in Hijra
years then current, he completed his 41st year on 28th Safar 1065
(28th December 1654.) He was 41 years and 10th months old when
the Hijra year 1065 ended (last day of Zilaija) on 28th October
1655. As he had not completed his 42nd year when the Samudra-
Sangama was composed we must infer that this work was composed
between 21st October ( 1st Moharam 1066) and 27th December 1655
(28 Safar 1066 A. H.) the date of Dārā's completion of his 42nd
year.“
The foregoing details of the chronology of Dārā's present
work are in harmony with the following facts about his life and
his contact with Benares Pandits as known to contemporary
authors :-
(1) Berniers in his letter dated 4th October 1667 from Chiras
in Persia to Monsieur Chapelain refers to Dārā's heresy as
follows:-
1. This date is equivalent to 23rd November 1708 ( Vide p. 219
of Indian Ephemeris, Vol. VI ).
2. Vide p. 113 of Indian Ephemeris, Vol. VI.

was constantly in the society of Brāhmans, Jogis and Sanyäsis......
He was under such delusion about this Bed that he collected
Brāhmanas and Sanyasis from all parts of the country, and paying
them great respect and attention, he employed them in translating

“In conclusion I shall explain to you the Mysticism of a Great
Sect which has latterly made a great noise in Hindoustan. in as
much as certain Pendets or Gentile Doctors had instilled it into the
minds of Dara and Sultan Sujah, the elder sor of Chah-Jehan."
(2) Dara when Governor or Viceroy of Benares in 1656 caus-
ed a Persian translation to be made from the Sanskrit texts of the
Upanishads. This translation was made by a large staff of Benares
Pandits. It has been rendered into Latin by Anquetil-Duperron
and published by him at Paris in 1801.'
(3) Bernier makes the following remarks about Dārā else-
where in his travels :-
“Born a Mahomedan, he continued to join in the excercises of
that religion ; but although thus publicly professing his adherence
to its faith, Dara was in private a Gentile with Gentiles and a Chri.
stian with Christians. He had constantly about him some of the
Pendets or Gentile Doctors on whom he bestowed large pensions
and from these it is thought he imbibed opinions in no wise accor-
dant with the religion of the land etc.”
(4) I have suggested in my paper on "Bernier and Kavindra-
cārya Sarasvati at the Mughal Court" that “one of the most cele-
brated Pendets in all the Indies who had formerly belonged to the
household of Dara" was identical with Kavindrācārya Sarasvati,
---

1. Vide footnote 5 on p. 323 of Bernier's Travels. Duperron's
version is criticised in the Edinburgh Review ( Jan. 1803) by Alexander
Hamilton, who was in India and who later was Professor of Sanskrit
in the East India College at Hailey bury. Hamilton pays a glowing
tribute to Dara's abilities.
On p. 592 of Elphinstone's History of India ( 1874) it is stated
that “Dara had written a book to reconcile the Hindu and Maho-
metan Doctrines.” Cowell in his footnote on this page states that
the Persian translation of the Upanishads made by Dara's order was
finished in Ramazan A. H. 1067 (A. D. 1657). He also invites our
attention to "the account of Nădir-in-nikåt or Seven days' dialogue
between the prince and Bābā Lāl in Wilson's Hindu Sects (Collected
Works Vol. I, p. 348). Evidently this Båbā Lāl is the same as his
name-sake referred to in the समुद्रसंगम.

who after Dåra's murder in A. D. 1659 was taken into service by
Danechmandkan, the patron of Bernier himself. Kavindrācārya's
contact with Dara before A. D. 1659 may have been responsible
for the production of such works like Samudra-Sangama in A. D.
1655 about which year Dara caused a Persian translation of the
Upanishads to be made from the Sanskrit original.
(5) Another noted Sanyasi revered by Dara was Gosvāmi
Nțsimhāśrama. Dr. C. K. Raja recently published a Sanskrit
letter' of Dara addressed to this Sanyasi. I have proved in a
special paper that this Sanyasi was identical with Brahmendra
Sarasvati, who is a signatory to a Nirnayapatra drawn up at
Benares in A. D. 1657.
(6) In a Hindi work called the paigacquar represented by a
MS' in the Anup Sanskrit Library, Bikaner, there is a Section con-
taining Dohas in praise of Dara Shukoh. This work was recently
brought to my notice by Prof. Dasharatha Sharma of Bikaner. Its
author is no other than Kavindrācārya Sarasvati who held much
influence over Emperor Shah Jahan, to whose praise he devotes a
big section of the present work. According to Prof. Dasharatha
Sharma this poem was composed " Somewhere between 1638 and
1657." This poem is a direct contemporary testimony from

BAMUDRA-BANGAMA OF DARA SAUKOH
Kavindrâcārya himself about his intimate contact with Emperor
Shah Jahan and his brilliant but unfortunate son Dara Shukoh, the
author of the Samudra-Sangama. The Mishra Brothers state that
Kavindrācārya composed a Hindi work called, ATATT in Samvat
1687 ( A. D. 1631 ).'
(8) In the history of Hindi literature by Mishra Brothers
called the f#staytaart? we are told that Dārā was the author of
two Hindi works composed in A. D. 1654 (Samvat 1710) viz.
(1) gietaTÉTE and ATHIE. A work called "arati è maafa "
containing Dārā's discussion with araratas on philosophic matters
is mentioned in the Marathi Biographical Dictionary called the
Madhyayugina Caritrakośa. Very probably this gratia is
identical with #qurararate mentioned by Dārā at the beginning
of his present work Samudra-Sarigama. Polemana refers to to a work
called सारसंग्रह (or सारसंग्रहराज) on medicine in Sanskrit and Bhasa.
I cannot say if this ARŠIE is identical with the ITHIC of Dārā
Shukoh referred to above.
(9) In A. D. 1597 - 98 Emperor Akbar had the Yogavāsiştha
translated into Persian. This translation was very lengthy and
not very useful. Dara Shikoh, therefore, got it retranslated into
an abridged form in A. D. 1656.5 After this paper was drafted I

secured a critical edition of the Majma' -ul-Bahrain with English
Translation, Notes and Varients by Prof. M. Mahfuz-ul-Haq of
the Presidency College, Calcutta, 1929 ( Bib. Ind. No. 246 ). From a
perusal of the English Translation of this work I have gathered an
impression that the Sanskrit Samudra-Sangama is an adaptation of
the Majma' – ul - Bahrain made almost simultaneously in the
year 1065 A. H. which is recorded as the date of composition
in the ending portions of both these works. Dārā may have got
this Sanskrit abridgmentmade by some Benares Pandit in his
employ in A. D. 1655.
I have already referred to arrara mentioned in the AGFATH as
" Frag aaraagui on folio 1 of our MS of A. D. 1708.
Prof. Haq has also drawn our attention to the reference to this
Hindu Saint found in the Majma' -ul-Bahrain (p. 24 of Eng.
Trans.) where he calls him Båbā Lal Bairagi and puts him side
by side with those Muhammadan Saints and divines who have
been the best representatives of the Sufi order in Islam. Prof.
Haq observes :-" The inclusion of the name of a Hindū in such
an exclusive list of Muslim divines shows unmistakably the high
esteem in which this devotee was held by Dārā Shikūh.".
Prof. Haq has collected much valuable information about the
contact of Dārā with Bābā Lāl. I shall here record a brief sum-
mary of it as it would be useful to know the Hindu influence on
Dāra's mind in his quest for Truth.
Bābā Lāl( = BL ) was a Hindu devotee of the Punjab. His
actual name was Lāl Dayāl. He was a Khatri of Kasur
living at Asthan, at Dhian pur near Batāla. He was a friend of
Mīyān Jiv. He came down to Lahore and conversed with Dārā.
(Continued from the previous page)
On folio 8a of Ihe B. O. R. I. MS of the Samudra-Sangama Dārā
quotes from CTTTTTATTO as follows :-
"agt aFA STARYU —
कल्पांतवायवो यांतु यांतु चैकत्वमर्णवाः ।
नयंतु द्वादशादित्या नास्ति निर्मनसः क्षतिः॥"
2. On page 32 of his Introduction Prof. Haq refers to an Arabic
translation of Majma-ul-Bahrain preserved in the Imperial Library,
Calcutta. He also 'refers to an Uğdū translation by Gokul Prasad
lithographed at Lucknow in 1872. These translations show the popu-
larity of the work.

SAMUDRA-SANGAMA OF DARA SHOKOH
443
A work called “Mukālima -;. Dārā wa Baba Lal” we find a sum-
mary of the questions asked by Dārā on the various topics of
Hindu religion and the replies given to them by BL. These con-
versations took place on Dārā's return from Fiandhar in 1062 A. H.
i. e. 3 years before the composition of the Samudrasangama in 1065
A. H. (A. D. 1655). Dārā refers to BL in his work called
" Hasanat -ul - Arifin " composed A. H. 1064 as follows :-
"Bābā Lāl Mandiya is one of the perfect Arifs and I have seen
none in the Hindu community who is equal to him in majesty and
firmness. He told me 'There are 'Arifs, and perfect ( divines)
in every community through whose grace God grants salvation to
that community.”
Dārā's private secretary Chandar Bhān took a verbatim repost
of the whole dialogue between Dārā and BL and thus prepared the
book “Mukālima - i - Dārā Shiküh wa Bābā Lal."
In the Curzon Collection of the Royal Asiatic Society of
Bengal (1908–1910 ) there is a copy of Puthi Urisi in Persian which
contains memoirs of BL and an account of BL's interview with
Dārā in 1059 A. H. (= A. D. 1649.)
Prof. Haq notes the following paintings in which BL and Dārā
are portrayed :-
Plate No. XXII in Binyon's Court Painters of the Grand
Moghals (Oxford University Press, 1921) - Binyon states :--
“Lāl Swāmi......was a Kshatriya born in Malwa in the reign of
Jahangir ; after having been initiated he settled near Sirhind in
the Punjab, where he built himself a hermitage together with a
temple and was visited by a large number of disciples. Among
those who were attracted by his teaching was Dārā Shikoh ; two
learned Hindus who were in this prince's service have recorded in
a work entitled Nadir-al-Nikāt the conversation that took place
between them in the year 1649."
(2) In plate XIX of Binyon's book BL appears in a group of
12 Indian divines viz. Räy Dās. Pipā, Nämdiv, Sā'in, Kamál,
Awghar, Kabir, Pir Machandar, Gorakh Jadru (?), Pir Panth
Swāmi (?), and is styled there as Lāl Swāmi.
(3) A painting was exhibited at the Second Meeting of the
Indian Historical Records Commission in which Dārā and BL are
shown in each other's company.
(4) An unidentified painting in Percy Brown's Indian Paint-

ing under the Mughals ( Plate No. XLVI) portrays in the opinion
of Prof. Haq the meeting between Dārā and Bābā Lāl.
In Prof. Haq's edition of the Majam-ul-Bahrain I have not
found any reference to the Samudra-Sangama. He states that a
very difficult task which confronted him was that of identification
and transliteration of Sanskrit terms which had been so mutilated
in the Persian text that in many cases it became almost impossible
to identify them correctly. Prof. Haq, therefore, availed himself
of the help of Dr. S. N. Das-Gupta in going through some portion
of the English translations and further the identification and trans-
lation of Sanskrit terms was carried out for Prof. Haq by Prof. N.
Chakravarti. I believe that this difficulty could have been over-
come by the above professors had they known about the MSS of
the Samudra.Sangama, which being a Sanskrit counterpart of the
Persian original executed in the year 1065 A. H. had the advantage
of Dārā's own supervision in its composition, even if we presume
that the work was written by some Benares Pandit for Dārā.
Now that the Persian original of the Samudra-Sangama has
been critically edited and translated by Prof. Haq the work of
editing the Samudra-Sangama would be made easy. In fact my
friend Mr. K. Madhav Sarma, Curator of Anup Sanskrit Library,
Bikaner, intends to edit the work. He has secured a MS of this
work already and I am keeping at his disposal the oldest dated MS
A. D. 1708 (No. 1043 of 1891-95) in the Government MSS
Library, B. O. R. Institute.) Mr. Sarma will have to identify and
transliterate correctly the Persian terms in the Samudra-San-
gama in the same manner as the Sanskrit terms have been dealt
with by Prof. Hag in his edition of the Persian original. At any
rate we have now two MSS of the Sanskrit work, one of which
was copied 53 years after the date of its composition and hence
possesses great value for purposes of textual reconstruction. As
I don't possess any first-hand knowledge of Dārā's Persian works
I must rely on Prof. Haq's scholarly exposition of “ Dārā's Reli-
gious Views" (pp. 26–30 of Introduction to Majam-ul-Bahrain)
from which I note the following points for the information of
Sanskrit scholars :-
(1) According to one authority Majam-ul-Bahrain, the last
original work of Dārā, was the very work which brought about his
death.
(2) The earlier studies of Dārā were purely Sufistic in
character.

Page 476****************************************************************************************
SAMUDRA-SANGAMA OF DARA SHUKOH
445
(3) Dārā writes in his translation of the Upanishads that after
his discipleship of Mulla Shāh he came in close contact with the
the divines of various religions and perused the Psalms, the Gospels
and the Pantateuch. Before A. H. 1062 Dārā expressed no opinion
on various religions more especially Hinduism,
(4) In his Shathiyat ( 1062 A. H.) Dārā quotes Bābā Lal's
aphorism that “Truth is not the monopoly of any one religion".
(5) In 1065 A. H. Dārā composed Majma-ul-Bahrain (or
AESTA ) in which he expressed his views in a fearless manner
as follows:-
“I have written this book for the members of my family and
have nothing to do with the common ones of both the religions."
(Cf. ASETTA folio 1 –“FETTHETTATO a faith arare Fagaga-
ध्वनुकंपया कृतीयमारंभः। न पुनरज्ञानिनो विभिन्नमतसंबंधिनोबोधनेन मम
Tita 11)",
(6) In the Samudra-Sangama Dārā appears as a student of
comparative religion, showing the points of identity between
Hinduism and Islam without exalting or undermining either.
(7) Prof. Haq states that “ Dārā had not renounced his own
faith and become a Hindu as is asserted by a biased section of the
community (p. 27 of Intro.). Dārā believed in the Kuran and
was of opinion that “the Vedas were in accordance with the Kuran
or rather they were an interpretation of that ".
(Cf. FRETTA folio 6b -
" अपौरुषेय ग्रंथोस्माकं कुराणं सिद्धानां वेद इत्युच्यते ")
(8) Dārā was indicted by the ecclesiasts of Aurangzeb's Court
for his apostasy, but Prof. Haq states :-" Any one can choose to
be the champion of Islām and remove all those who stand in the
way of the realization of his political ambitions.” It was obviously
the mixture of politics and religion in Dārā's days that made Dāră a
martyr to his views.
I now close this paper on the Samudra-Sangama of Dārå Shu-
1. Cf. Bhagavadgitā :
"न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसंगिनाम् ।
जोषयेत्सर्व कर्माणि विद्वान्युक्तः समाचरन् ॥"

koh with a request to Sanskrit Scholars and the students of the
Mughal history to reconstruct the history of Därā's contact with
Benares paņạits which yet needs careful exploration and recon-
struction on the basis of contemporary sources, both Sanskrit and
Persian. In fact this Samudra-Sarigama of various historical sour-
ces can alone lead to historical truth, divested of the mythical
gossip that generally gathers round the life-history of unique
historical personages of every age and clime. May Dārā's soul
rest in eternal peace. Dārā died a Socratic death.

śrama of Dara Shukoh's Sanskrit Letter
with Brahmendra Sarasvatī of the Kavīndra -
Candrodaya — Between A. D. 1628 & 1658 *
Dr. C. Kunhan Raja' published in 1940 an interesting Sanskrit
letter of Mohamed Dara Shukoh, the son of Shah Jahan and half-
brother of Aurangzeb. The particulars of this letter as given by
Dr. Raja may be noted below:
(1) The letter is “written to Gosvāmi Nýsimha Saras-
vati as noticed in lines eleven to thirteen of
Section (24)."
(2) It is "more an address than a letter."
(3) Its MS is in the Adyar Library ( No. XI. D. 4)( Vide
p. 2 (b) of Adyar Cata. II, 1928 and MS No. 3111
of R.A.S.B. Cata. IV, as also Kavindräcārya Suci,

Office Cata. VII, (1904) MS No. 3947 on p. 499 and
Mitra's Notices X, MS No. 4028].
(4) The MS bears the date Samvat 1805 ( 1748 A. D.)
"मितिराश्वीनशुक्लतृतीयायां संवत् १८०५ अष्टादशशतोत्तरपञ्चमाब्दे"
This cannot be the date of the letter. It must be
the "date of transcription or more probably the
date given should be Samvat 1705 ( 1648 A. D.) if it
is Dara Shukoh's date."
(5) The letter of Dara Shukoh must have ended with

tions a letter from साहजीक, who may be साहजी of
Tanjore (1684-1711 A. D.) or Shah Jahan (1628-
1658 A. D.)
(6) Both the letters are found in the same MS.
(7) There is no need to alter the date " Samvat'' 1805 as
it is reasonable to take it as the date of trans-
cription.
I am concerned here with the first of these letters which
gives the name of Dara Shukoh and the addressee Nộsimha-
śrama at the end of Section 24, which reads as follows:-
"......सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूपेषु महायतिवरभूपेषु परिकल्पितनिर्विकल्पसमाधि-
विध्वस्तसंसारमहाश्रमेषु श्रीगोस्वामिनृसिंहाश्रमेषु प्रकटितपरमानन्दसंदोह तत्वज्ञान-

___ I propose to identify "गोस्वामिनृसिंहाश्रम" with ब्रह्मेन्द्रसरस्वती
who was a resident of Benares and a contemporary of Shah Jahan
(1628-1658 A. D.). My evidence for the proposed identification
is as follows:-
(1) There is a निर्णयपत्र' dated Saka 1579 (= A. D. 1657 )

It is clear from the second endorsement quoted above that
there lived at at Benares in A. D. 1657 a Sanyasin called नृसिंहाश्रम
who was more popularly known as "ब्रह्मेन्द्रसरस्वती." He was also
contemporary of another Sanyasin " पूर्णेन्द्रसरस्वती" whose endorse-

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The foregoing evidence may now be briefly recorded as
follows:-
A. D. 1628–1658 – Brahmendra Sarasvati was a pre-eminent
Sanyāsin of Benares, highly respected by his contemporaries
as shown by references to him in the frogaria' (Ms of
A. D. 1678 ) a contemporary record of Shab Jahan's time.
A.D. 1620-1660 - Rāmāśrama, the author of the adient,
who was possibly a junior contemporary of Fattaat
refers to him in this work.
A. D. 1628–1658 — Dara Shukoh in his address to T ETETA
calls him ffaa (279, an expression similar to the expression
"यतीन्द्रवन्दमुल्यैः" applied to ब्रह्मेन्द्र in the कवीन्द्रचन्द्रोदय in which
the contact of कवीन्द्राचार्य with Shah Jahan and Dara Shukoh
is expressly stated on p. 23 as follows:
"ga st af GTET pofafas*: Fara asy: Fats i
किं चावश्यं प्रपनः पुनरपि विहितः शाहिदाराशकोहः ॥"
A. D. 1657 – The fauiqua of A. D. 1657 drawn up at gfase
मण्डप in Benares discloses for the first time that ब्रह्मेन्द्रसरस्वती
is identical with greTETSTH ("ATGERTATUTaqua: ne
TAFU").
In view of the above contemporary evidence of the Kavindra
Candrod aya', the Durajanamukha-Capeţikā of one Rāmāśrama,
Dara Shukoh's Sanskrit Address and the Nirnayapatras drawn up
at Muktimandapa in Benares, I am inclined to believe that IFTA-
1. The Calcutta MS of the fateToca (Mitra's Notices, II,
MS No. 815 ) is dated A. D. 1678 ( Samvat 1734). Vide p. 1 of Intro.

3. This is a valuable document as it contains the endorsements
of about 75 learned men of Benares who lived in the middle of the
17th century. Though this document is published in the Marathi
book -“faa769$TOT " by R. S. Pimputkar in 1926 I propose to edit
it again as an appendix to one of my projected papers with historical
notes on the identification of at least some of these learned men. It
may be noted here that some of the contributors to Kavindra
Candrodaya are signatories to this for at of Ą. D. 1657.

PETA to whom Dara Shukoh sent his Sanskrit address is no

52. The tradition about Liaison of Jagannātha
Panditarāja with a Muslim Lady (Yavanī) –
Is it a Myth ?*
Like the life-history of many of his celebrated contemporaries,
the life-history of Jagannatha Pandita is shrouded in mystery.
Some of the traditions about this dominant personality of the
middle of the 17th century are taken as facts of history by the
orthodox pandits while they are dismissed as myths by modern
writers. No attempt seems to have been made to examine all
these traditions from the historical point of view, which requires
a painstaking investigation not only in contemporary sources but
in subsequent sources, whether Sanskrit or non - Sanskrit.'
* Bharatīya Vidya, Vol. VI, Part 1, pp. 57-62.
1. In this connection Dr. Qanungo's paper on "Some sidelights
on the character and court-life of Shah Jahan" published in the
Journal of Indian History, Madras, Vol. 8 (1929), pp. 49 and 50, is
noteworthy. Some points from this paper pertaining to Jagannātha
may be recorded here :-
(i) Jagannatha is referred to in the Padshahnama as a Kala-
want ( musician).
(ii) On the 22nd Rabi-us-Sani Jagannātha Kalāwant presented
to the emperor 12 literary pieces composed in the name of
His Majesty ( Shah Jahan), who was so pleased that Jagan-
nātha was weighed against silver and the whole amount of
Rs. 4,500 was presented to Jagannātha.
(iii) Fagannātha Kalāwant was first given the title of Kaviraya
and after some time that of Mahā Kaviraya.
(iv) Jagannātha (Kalāwant ) headed the list of authors at the
Mughal Court. Dr. Qanuogo identifies Jagannātha Kalā-
want with Jagannātha, the author of Rasagangādhara and
Asaflahari ( Asafviläsa ). I have noted these points from
Prof. V. A. Sastri's remarks on p. 23 of bis Jagannatha
Pandita.

TRADITION ABOUT LIAISON OF JAGANNATHA PAŅDITARĀJA 453
In a recent volume' on Jagannatha Pandita Prof. V. A. Rama-
swami Sastri of the Annamalai Universitty has devoted one
Chapter to "Jagannātha's Life - history" and gathered all known
data about this history. It is a laudable attempt as it provides
us with all earlier references on the subject and thus lays bare the
points which need further investigation. I have been collecting
materials on these lines but as it will take a long time to put them
in print I have thought it advisable to make a beginning by
putting on record some evidence on the tradition about the
liaison of Jagannātha with a yavani or muslim lady, which is always
mentioned with wonder and amazement by the orthodox paņạits
and with a prying curiosity and hidden admiration by some of
our modern Sanskritists with a reformist and cosmopolitan bias.
In support of Jagannātha's liaison with a Muslim lady some
verses' are cited. Prof. Sastri states that, “ these verses are not
1. Jagannatha Pandita ( Annamalai Univ. Series, No. 8), Anna-
malaioagar, 1942. In chapter I the author deals with the elder and
close contemporaries of Jagannatha. Among these I find the names
of (1) acca , (2) ZIET Etiera and (3) Tarari atradt. He
seems to be unware of the following papers published by me on these
personalities :-
(i) The Chronology of the Works of Khandadeva (D. R.
Bhandarkar Volume, Calcutta, 1939, pp. 9-15).
(ii) A new Approach to the Date of Bhattoji Dikşita ( Annals S.
V. Ori. Institute Tirupati, 1940, Vol. I, pp. 117-127).
(iii) Bernier and Kavindrācārya Sarasvati at the Mughal Court,
(Annals, Tirupati, 1940, Vol. I, Part 4, pp. 1-16). See also

Festschrift P. V. Kane, ( 1941 ), pp. 188-199.

3. These verses as quoted by Prof. Sastri are :-
" यवनी नवनीतकोमलाङ्गी

अवनीतलमेव साधु मन्ये
न वनी माधवनी विनोदहेतुः ॥१॥

found in any one of his ( Jagannath's) works. ... As there is no
direct reference to any Muslim beauty in this work (in the
Sțngāra Samullāsa of the Bhāminiviläsa ) it is doubtful whether
he had been intimate with a Muslim lady. The stanzas cited
might be the productions of his enemies whom he had not spared
and in revenge were probably fathered upon him.” Prof. Sastri
concludes his discussion' of the topic as follows:-
" It may be remembered in this connection that Shah Jahan
interdicted Hindu - Muhammadan marriages in Kashmir. There-
fore, it is unlikely that he tolerated his protège Jagannāth's
marriage with a Muslim lady." Against this conclusion of Prof.
Sastri I have to point out that the practice of maintaining liaison
with Muslim ladies was not uncommon in the 17th century or even
in the 16th century. For instance Lolimbarāja? who belonged to
the latter half of the 16th century had his liaison with Ratnakalā
a Muslim beauty who is constantly referred to in his works. Then
again a Brahmin Dayādeva Sarmā had his liaison with Cimani' the
daughter-in-law of Allāhvardi Khān Turkmãn ( between A. D. 1606
and 1660 ) one of the great grandees at Shah Jahan's court. It is,
therefore, quite probable that Jagannātha Pandita maintained his
liaison with a yavani in spite of his contact with Shah Jahan's
court.
Now let us see if we can record the earliest mention of the

tradition of Jagannātha and his contact with a yavani (or Muslim
beauty ). So far as my investigation goes I have found such men-
tion in the commentary of Sadāśiva on the Gangålahari of Jagan-
nātha Pandita. Sadāśiva observes at the beginning of his com-
mentary:~
__ " अन एवं श्रूयते । कवि जगन्नाथो दिल्लीवल्लभाश्रितस्तद्यवनीसंसर्गदोषभाक्

(Govt. MSS Library)-No. 433 of 1884-87, which bears the date'
Saka 1750%DA. D. 1828.
As the tradition about Jagannātha and his yavani is recorded
recorded in a MS of Sadasiva's commentary copied in A. D. 1828
we can safely infer that it was current towards the end of the 18th
century. I have not examined the date of Sadāśiva's commen-
tary but it is obviously earlier than A. D. 1828. It is thus clear
that this tradition is at least about 150 years old.

STUDIRS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY

years old and as they are connected with the tradition about
Jagannātha's yavanī recorded by the commentator Sadaſiva we may
not be wrong if we consider them practically of the same age as
the tradition i.e.about 150 years old, if not more.

verses about this yavani found in a MS of A, D. 1843 make it abun-
dantly clear that this tradition had crystallized by the end of the
18th century and that it is about 150 years old. We cannot, there-
fore, brush it aside without tracing its origins in earlier sources. At
any rate we should keep it open for further investigation and
should not treat it as a pure myth without any foundation in fact.
It has been my experience that traditions dismissed as improbable
by responsible scholars' with critical acumen have been proved by
me on contemporary evidence, the genuineness of which has now
been acknowledged by them. I would, therefore, request my friend
Prof. Sastri to examine the tradition about Jagnnātha's yavani
more closely on the strength of all sources, contemporary and
subsequent ones, and then express a decisive opinion on it. Sans-
kritists are not to blame if they are unable to prove facts of

A physician and surgeon called Bernard was a favourite of
Jahangir. He was paid 10 crowns per day. He fell in love with a
damsel of Jahangir's Court. Her mother resisted the overtures of
Bernard. Jahangir offered him a present for an extraordinary cure
effected by him in his Seraglio. Bernard refused the gift before the
Court assembly and in lieu thereof asked for the damsel in question
then waiting for the customary salām at the court, “The whole
assembly smiled at this refusal of the present and at a request so
little likely to be granted, he being a Christian and the girl a Maho-
medan and a Kencheny; but Jehan-Guyre, who never felt any reli-
gious scruples, was thrown into a violent fit of laughter, and comman-
ded the girl to be given to him 'Lift her on the physician's shoulders'
he said, ' and let him carry the Kenchen away.' No sooner said than
done. In the midst of a crowded assembly, the girl was placed on
Bernard's back who withdrew triumphantly with his prize and took
her to his house.” This story of Bernard and his yavani may be
favourably compared with that of Jagannatha and his yavani.

traditions' about the personal history of Sanskrit authors but it is
their sacred duty to bring to the notice of historians such facts or
traditions which nced further investigation. I myself have been
struggling continuously in this direction for the last twenty-five
years but the results of my labour have hardly touched the very
fringe of the uncharted field of the history of Sanskrit and allied
literature represented by the innuinerable manuscripts in our
Manuscript Libraries.
1. Mr. Ramrao Martand Bhamburkar in his Life of Pandit
Jagannātharāya and Sangita Gangalahari, Baroda, 1928 ( Pages 137+
72 ) has collected and recorded all facts and fiction about Jagannatha.
The volume makes interesting reading but it is difficult to penetrate
the mist of tradition as recorded in this volume. He has composed
a Marathi play called taajarfure based on Jagannatha and his yavani.
It is in three acts. Mr. Bhamburkar makes Jagannātha a contempo.
rary of Emperor Akbar ( A. D. 1556-1605) while Prof. Ramaswami
Sastri gives us "c. A. D. 1590–1665" as the date of Jagannatha,
which I think is acceptable. I appreciate Mr. Bhamburkar's fervour
but not his chronology, which is somewhat misleading and contrary
to contemporary evidence. In Mr. Bhamburkar Jagannātha has
found a kindred spirit to render his Gangålahari ably in Marathi
songs, which are characterized by a felicity of diction and ease of
style, qualities rarely to be found in some of the Marathi renderings
of Sanskrit poems.

during the period of his life (between c. A. D. 1590-1665)'. In
spite of these enemies the banner of his fame, though it may have
been torn by his contemporary rivals, is kept fluttering even to this
day and will continue to flutter so long as Sanskrit literature
continues to live. In spite of a few contemporaries, who may
have been in conflict with his way of life? or his literary activities
there were others who were influenced by his poetry and learning.
I propose in this paper to record how the influence of this mighty
mind affected the Deccani poets and pandits. My data on this
topic is not exhaustive but only representative and hence may be
made more elaborate by additional facts from contemporary sour.
ces, if available on a fresh research in sources hitherto known or
in sources which remain still untapped.
The first dated reference to Jagannātha Panditarāja by a
Deccanis author is found in an anthology called the Padyāmſta-

tarangini completed on Thursday, 12th of June 1673 by Bhaskara
(alias Hari) at Benares. In this work on anthology a verse is
quoted and its authorship ascribed to Panditarāja. This verse as
found by me in Manuscript No. 376 of 1884-87 in the Government
Manucripts Library at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute,
reads as follows:
Folio 7 qfUcatisTET I
"दिनागाः प्रतिपेदिरे प्रथमतो जास्यैव नेतथ्यताम्
संभाव्य स्फुटविक्रमोथ वृषभो गौरव गौरीपतेः ।
विक्रान्तेनिकषः करोतु कृतमं मामत्रिलोकीतले
कण्ठे कालकुटुम्बिनी करुणया सिक्तः सकण्ठीरवः ।। १०८॥"
I have not identified the above verse but presuming that it was
composed by Jagannātha Paņạitarāja as stated in the manuscript of
the anthology we must regard it as the earliest quotation from Jaga:
nnātha by a Deccani writer, whose family came from Tryambakeśva-
ra near Nasik. The author of the anthology, Bhāskara (alias Hari)
as also his father Apājibhațţa, were both residing at Benares.
Apāji (C. A. D. 1650 ) as also his son Bhāskara (A.D. 1650–1690 or
80 ) may have come into contact with Jagannātha Panditarāja. At
any rate Apāji was a contemporary of Panditarāja (A.D. 1590 to 1660
or so) and must have read the works of Jagannātha produced during
his life-time, say between A. D. 1610 and 1650. It is, therefore,
Possible to suppose that his son Bhāskara was familar with Jagan-
nātha's poetry. If these suggestions are accepted we may reason-
ably presume that the verse ascribed to Paņditarāja by Bhāskara in
his anthology of A. D. 1673 is the earliest quotation from Pandita-
rāja by a Deccani writer of the second half of the seventeenth
century'.

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The next Deccani author to be influenced by the writings of
Jagannātha Panditarāja was Hari Kavi' alias Bhānubhațța, who was a
resident of Surat” in Gujarat. He wrote some works by the order of
Krena Pandita, the guru of the Maratha King Sambhaji (A.D. 1680-
1689) and of Sambhaji himself. He composed his Sambhuraja.
carita or a poetical life of his patron Sambhaji in A. D. 1685. He
composed an anthology called the Subhasitahārāvali in which he
quotes five verses and ascribes them to Jagannātha Panditarāja.
My friend Dr. H. D. Sharma has been able to identify two of these
verses in Jagannatha's works. These two verses are as follows:-
(Continued from the previous page )

TETETT mentioned in verses 3 and 5 needs to be identified.
The last three verses quoted by Hari Kavi and the only verse
quoted by Bhāskara need to be identified, if possible, in the known
works of Panditaräia. It is possible to suppose that some of the
arāja: It is possible to suppose that some. Even
stray poetic composition of Jagannatha has been lost to us. Even
his Rasagangadhara has survived in an incomplete form.
Dr. Hara Datta Sharma was the first to point out these verses
in the Subhăşitahārāvali' of Hari Kavi though he was not then
aware that this poet had any connection with the Marāthā King
Sambhāji, the son of Shivāji the Great. In my elaborate paper on
Hari Kavi referred to above I have examined all the fragments of
Hari Kavi's works discovered by Bühler in 1875 and linked up the
literary activities of this poet with the Marāțhā history of the
seventeenth century.
The influence of Jagannātha on Hari Kavi is not confined
merely to his quotations from Jagannātha's work. In his grünen
ray written in a sustained classical style we find the influence of
Paņạitarāja almost in every line of the fragment that has come
down to us. This fragment is manuscript No. 327 of 1875-76
1. Vide Ind. Hist. Quarterly, Vol. X, 1934, pp. 485 ff.
2. It is a pity that no student of Marāțhā history has been able
so far to discover any reference to Hari Kavi in contemporary
records. This is due to the dearth of these records especially for the
period of Sambhāji's reign (A. D. 1680-1689). The story of Hari
Kāvi's contact with Sambhaji was unknown to Marātha history till
the publication of my paper in 1935. Prof. Scherbatsky edited the
Haihayendracarita from the fragment of manuscripts made available
to him by Bühler. He could not, however, establish its connection
with the Maratha King Sambhāji. Vide Memoirs of the Imperial
Academy of Sciences, Vol. IV, No. 9 ( 1894).

acquired by Bühler in 1875. On folio 21 of this fragment we find
Hari Kavi's appreciation of Jagannatha's poetical composition :-
"कमलपटलस्फारत्स्फूर्जन्मनोहरसौरभो-
म्मदमधुकरणीसिंजातसमुद्रतमाधुरी ।
नहि सुभगतां लोकेविंदस्यनेकगुणा तां

This poem was composed by Hari Kavi by the order of King
Sambhāji as also its commentary called the tyratif (Manu-
script No. 829 of 1875-76). In the commentary Hari Kavi himself
explains the above reference to Jagannātha as follows :-
Fol. 71° -“विशेषतः कवि प्रशंसति ॥ कमलेति । माधुरीकत्रः ॥
कविवर जगनाथास्पण्डितरायापरनानः कवेरित्यर्थः। उदंचंती। समुदयंती

These references clearly prove the influence of Panditarāja on a
Deccani poet who flourished between A. D. 1650 and 1700 and
who, though resident of Surat in Gujarat had some contact with
the ruling line of the Marāțhā Kings, Shivāji' and Sambhāji on
whom he has showered much praise in his works.

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The third Deccani author to be influenced by Jagannātha
Panditarāja was Vāmana Pandita, who is assigned by Marāțhi-scho-
lars to the latter half of the seventeenth century' to which Hari Kavi
belonged as we have stated above. He rendered Jagannātha's
Gangalahari into Marāthi verse using the original metre used by
Jagannātha viz. farettir. It is, therefore, known as Samaśloki.
This rendering of Vāmana Pandita is very popular in the Deccan.
If the date assigned to Vāmana Paņạita is correct his Samasloki
rendering of the Gargalahari is perhaps the earliest and the finest
tribute to Jagannatha's poetic genius by a Deccani poet of
Vāmana's fame and popularity. “That which comes from the
heart goes to the heart" and Jagannātha's Gangālahari did not fail
to go to the heart of a poet like Vāmana, whose early life followed
(Continued from the previous page )

शिवाख्यो देशानामधिपतिरनेकाद्भुतगुणः ।
..........................................
वदान्यो नेहान्यो जगति शिवभपाद्विजयते ॥"
1. Vide p. 247 of HETTIE HTTFT by Bhave, 1919. Vámana flou-
rished towards the close of Sālivāhana Saka - 16th 'century. He is
believed to have died in Sāka 1617 ( = A. D. 1695). The Mahara-
striya Jñanakosa ed. by Dr. S. V. Ketkar (Vol. XX, 1926) p. (9986)
assigns Vāmana Paņdita to the period A.D. 1636–1695 (See also p. 729
of HEYTIT T119&in by S. Chitrav, Poona, 1937). According to Mr. V.
Bhave Vāmana belonged to Bijapur. He studied Persian in his
early life and Sanskrit later at Bagares. He composed some Sanskrit
prakaranas such as (1) ferrataa, (2) THIET. He composed
FATHATT in A. D. 1673 and 377T raufa in A. D. 1675. He translated
the शतक of भर्तृहार, the गङ्गालहरी of जगन्नाथ and the भगवद्गीता into Marathi
verse.
2. If Jagannatha flourished between c. A. D. 1590 and 1665 and
Vāmana between A. D. 1636 and 1695 and as Vāmana studied Sans-
krit at Benares, there is reason to believe that Vamana may have come
into personal contact with Jagannātha especially during the closing
years of Pandita rāja's career and perhaps as a result of this contact
Vămana may have undertaken to translate the Gangälaharī into
Marathi verse. A manuscript of Jagannātha's fazathtaTaga is dat-
ed A. D. 1652-3. This work mentions his 19177997, which mentions
the five satts of Jagannātha, including the tatt. We may, there-
fore, presume that the intact was composed before A. D. 1650 aod

close on Jagannatha's literary career. The flower of Jagannatha's
poetic genius was not born to blush unseen or to waste its sweet-
0088 on the desert air but it emitted its fragrance far and wide,
away from the Mughal court and the banks of the Ganges, where
lived some of his contemporary rivals and enemies in the latter
half of the seventeenth century'.
The chronology of the Deccani authors influenced by Jagan.
nātha Panditarāja may now be recorded in the following table :-

I close this paper with a request to Sanskritists and historians
for collecting more data on the subject of this paper.
1. Leaving aside Jagannatha's rivals we must study in detail
the life-history of Jagannātha's pupils who were influenced by his
poetry and learning. Jagannātha was a Tailanga Brahmin. A work
called कुलप्रबन्ध was composed by हरिहर भट्ट an ancestor of कृष्णकवि
(court-poet of Sevai Jayasing). This ETTET states that his uncle
नारायण was the pupil of जगन्नाथ पण्डितराय. Narayana's brother रामकृष्ण
was in the favour of Raja Ramsing I of Jaipur who came to the throne
in A. D. 1667. Verse 77 of Fogare reads as follows :-
"Four laat fa fast: qf0GATTHETETT I
नारायणस्तु देवादल्पायुः स्वपुरीमगमत् ॥"
after brings the history of this hasot Brahmin family upto A. D. 1700
(Vide B. I. S. Mandal Quarterly: XXII, p. 16, 1941 ).

Works – Between A. D. 1610 and 1670 *
So far only two MSS of the poem Cimani-Carita were
known. Both of them are in the Govt. MSS Library under the
following numbers :-
(1) No. 698 of 1886–92, dated Samyat 1800 = A. D. 1744.
(2) No. 357 of 1884–87, dated Samvat 1744 = A. D. 1688.
Both these MSS record the date of composition of the work
represented by the chronograms “fractic" in MS No. 3 57 of.
1884-87 and "HETERIET" in MS No. 698 of 1886-92. In 1928
I proved in a note' published in the Annals of the B. O. R. Ing-
titute that the chronogram " TheTEIC" found in the MS of A. D.
1688 was correct, being equal to 12 (FET = fHIET = Sun), 7 (ga),
11 ) = Samvat 1712 or A. D. 1656. Recently I have published
a paper on the historical background of the fanatafta in which I
have presumed the identity of the author of the Cimani-Carita
with the author of a work on grammar called the Sabda-Sobha
composed in A. D. 1637, both these authors having the same name
and surname viz. f or ys. After the publication of this paper
my friend Dr. V. Raghavan of the Madras University informed me
that there is a third MS of the Cimani-Carita in the Anūpa Library
of Bikaner. Through the courtesy and kindness of the Director-
General of Education of Bikaner and the Librarian of the above
library I got prepared a copy of this MS which bears No. 3036 of
that Library. This MS is very important as it is dated" Samvat
1726'' = A. D. 1670. It was written 14 years after the date of

O. R. Institute MS of A. D. 1688 by 18 years. We get, therefore,
the following dates of the work and its subsequent copies :

It is clear from the above dates that the Bikaner MS of the poem
is the oldest dated copy and hence very useful from the textual
point of view. This copy contains the correct reading of the
chronogram viz." FAETH=" unlike the approximately correct
reading "thergaire" or the hopelessly incorrect reading
"Hetering" or its suggested emendation "Aflyai” ( = 1471
Samvat) by Peterson. The Bikaner MS justifies my correct
interpretation of the date viz. A. D. 1656 and at the same time illus-
trates the importance of the oldest-dated copies of works not only
for determining their texts but also for the verification of dates
left uncertain by the readings of comparatively later copies of
these works. It should, therefore, be noted that in the present
stage of our chronology we must endeavour to bring to the notice
of scholars all dated MSS' of works and then to point out the
oldest dated MSS of these works. I have accordingly published
some papers on these lines with a view to studying the chronologi-
cal perspective of both the original works and their subsequent
copies. With these remarks about the oldest dated MS of the
Cimani.Carita I record below my evidence regarding the identity
of the authors of the Cimani-Carita ( a love poem) and the Sabda-
sobha ( a work on grammar). This work was composed in A. D.
1637.: A MS of this work is dated 1680 ( Samvat 1736). This is

regarding dated MSS in different MSS Libraries.

the oldest dated MS of the Sabdasobhá so far discovered by me.
In the concluding verses' of the Sabdašobhä we get the following
details about its author :-

(2) He was the son of the daughter of one पछाचार्य..
(3) He was the pupil of भट्टोजिदीक्षित and had studied शब्दशास्त्र.
(4) His name was नीलकंठ कवि.

NILAKAŅTHA SUKLA AND HIS WORKS

bear close objective similarity to the verses at the end of the
Sabdasobhā, besides furnishing identical details regarding parent-
age. The verses of the Cimanī.Carita give us two important
details about after T viz. (1) TTT, the name of his mother, (2) HE
श्रीमंडन the guru of नीलकंठ in अलंकृतिशास्त्र. While in the शब्दशोभा he
states that he was the pupil of भट्टोजिदीक्षित, in the चिमनीचरित he
states that he studied almkştišāstra under HE sfrauen,' whose
identity needs to be investigated. It is clear from the verses
about Nilakantha in the Cimani-Carita and the Sabdasobhá that
these works are by the same author as they contain identical parti-
culars viz:-
(1) fred, the name of the author.
(2) 1 Tiga, the name of his father.
(3) वछाचार्य, the name of the मातामह of the author.
(4) Both the works viz. TECTIAT (A.D. 1637) and farnatafta
(A. D. 1656 ) were completed and dedicated to god fata on a f1a.
fat day. (In both these works we find the following line com-
mon :--- " fatariat fragat farofagrarfar asta"). To these
details common to both the works we may add the following found
in either of these works:-
(5) भट्ठोजिदीक्षित was his guru in शब्दशास्त्र.
(6) HE ståsa was his guru in fata.
(7) EITT was the name of his mother, the daughter of agrari,
who was the maternal grandfather of नीलकंठ,
My study of the Cimani-Carita has proved the romantic nature
of Nilakantha Sukla. He appears to have composed this work in his
old age ( in A.D. 1656 ) when he was no longer under the influence of
the veteran grammariao Bhattoji Dikṣita, his early guru in TECTIE.
We must, therefore, see if our author of a romantic bent of mind
composed any works on the lines of the Cimani.Carita, based on a
contemporary scandal in the harem of Allāh-Vardi-Khān Turkmān,
a great Muslim nobleman of Shah Jahan's Court (between A. D.
1606 and 1660 or so ).
1. I wonder if HE THOSA, the guru of afstig in Alamkārasāstra
is identical with मण्डनमित्र साहित्यरसपोषिन् , the author of नानार्थशब्दानु-
FAH ( Vide Burnell's Cata. of Tanjore MSS, p. 50, London, 1879).
This work is described as a dictionary of homonyms alphabetically
arranged according to the finals. It appears to have been based on
the lexicon Vaijayantī to a considerable extent. (Vide Aufrecht
CC I, 285 ).

STUDIBS IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
A poem of the name ओष्टशतक by one नीलकंठ has been recorded
by Aufrecht'. The only MS of this poem is described by Weber
in his Catalogue of Berlin MSS. It is in the Chambers Collection
and consists of 118 verses. This small work of art is devoted
to a poetical description of a young lady's lower lip as stated in
verse 2 at the commencement of the poem. The concluding
verses of the poem mention details about the author, which are
practically the same mentioned in the fanarafia; viz. (1) father's
name शुक्ल जनार्दन, (2) वछाचार्य maternal grandfather, (3) भट्ट श्रीमंडन, the
guru of the author in alamkāraśāstra, (4) stir, the mother of the
author. In fact there is almost complete objective identity of the
verses in the विमनीचरित with those in the ओठशतकम्. It is, there-
fore, clear that the author of the TECTTHT and the faratafia com-
posed this romantic poem viz. the STIETTF represented by the rare
MS in the Berlin library.
There is another work mentioned by Aufrecht called the जार.
जातशतक. It is also represented by a MS in the Berlin Library
(Chambers Collection) described by Weber in his catalogue on the

The purpose of the जारजातशतकम् as defined by our author नीलकंठ in
the foregoing lines seems to be a tirade against literary plagiarism,
a subject of perennial interest in all countries and in all ages
characterized by literary activity. This whole poem is not before
me but judging by the 2 introductory verses I have reason to be-
lieve that the poem contains a Aling and also a sting at some of the
contemporary critics of Nīlakantha, the author of the TOGETTHT,
चिमनीचरित and ओष्ठशतक, who may have entertained feelings of

which Weber corrects as -

= 1717. This chronogram is continued as -
“Gareth ( Đem ) HHTG thể ra ”)
If Weber's correction of the chronogram is approved the date of com-
position of the work is Sam. 1717 = A. D. 1661. Fantafta was com-
posed in A. D. 1656 ( Sam. 1712).

55. Nilakantha Caturdhara, the Commentator
of the Mahābhārata - His Genealogy
and Descendants *
In April 1938 Mr. Sadashive Vishnu Chaudhari, the present
Registrar of the Law College, Poona, approached me with a
request that I should investigate the tradition current among his
family members about their direct descent from Nilakantha
Caturdhara, the celebrated commentator of the Mahabharata. He
further told me that he was unable to link up his known genea-
logy with that of Nilakanţha Caturdhara as we find it recorded in
his works partially. I gladly agreed to investigate the above
tradition as I was then preparing a paper' on the identification of
Nārāyaṇatirtha, the author of the work Bhattabhāṣāprakäsikā with
Nilkantha's guru in Mimāṁsā of the same name. Some informa-
tions given by Mr. Chaudhari about his family together with what

I could collect from a study of the works of Nilakantha has already
been recorded by me incidentally in the above paper, though I
could not then record the full evidence in support of my state-
ments based on the information supplied by• Mr. Chaudhari. I,
therefore, propose to record here the full evidence regarding the
genealogy of Nīlakantha Caturdhara as reconstructed by me on
the basis of my study of his works and the information supplied
by Mr. Chaudhari.
In all the colophons of Nilakantha's works he is called the son
of Govinda Sūri.' We may, therefore, take it that Govinda was the
father of Nilakantha Caturdhara. This parentage of Nīlakantha is

80 far as the names of Siva Dikṣita and his father Govinda Diksita
are concerned. Both the father and the son are described in
these records as bearing the surname starts and having Shrigonde
as their native place but residing at Vārāṇasī or Benares. It
appears that नीलकण्ठ, गोविन्द and शिव normally resided at Benares
and were educated at this seat of learning, though the family
hailed from Kopargaum in the Ahmadnagar district of the Bombay
Presidency.
Like Nilakaạtha an author of the name as T&T went to Benares
from कूपरग्राम and composed there a work called आचारप्रदीप (B. O.
R. I. Ms No. 84 of 1884-86). A t seems to have been a con.
temporary of sirasant and possibly his neighbour at Kopargaum.
He quotes Bhattoji Bhațţa in the above Ms which is dated A. D.
1729 and refers to gods शुक्रेश्वर and कचेश at Kopargaum ("ग्रामे कूपर-
......Tafa 79 Sat: 1 TIET graiferit fanga qa: FeaT:

The genealogy of Nīlakantha's family so far reconstructed
(Continued from the previous page )

1. Mr. Vasudeva Vishnu Meghashyam of Trymbak near Nasik
has kindly furnished the pertinent extracts of these records to Mr.
S. V. Chaudhari, from which I am quoting in this paper.
2. The record reads "itraa airea g. fara aifaa. 3. Eti nia
Tire TRTH ATTTUI." We already know from hata74137 that feta
Guia was born at Benares. It appears that at the time of their visit
to Tryambakeśvara both the father and son must have been residing
at Benares as stated in the above extract.
3. In verse 10 at the beginning of his fataarosa siat composed in
A. D. 1680 Nilakantha refers to his surname alatt in the expression-
"Sta carteira Titar." This statement shows that the surname
ETETT was current in Nilakantha's time, if not earlier. (Vide folio 2a
of Me No. 994 of 1884-87 of PraatSa11 - B. O. R. Institute )
Historian V. K. Rajawade derives the surname ut from the Sang-
krit word aardt (= TETT = TETTETTY = TETET = utt).' Vide
p. 72 of B. I. S. Mandal, Itiortta, for 1913 - Note No. 14 - "Tott."

may now he linked up with the subsequent genealogy of the family
as filed on 2nd September 1854 with the Inam Commissioner
Poona, by Vaman Shiv Dikshit Chaudhari of the Village Pathardi'
in the Ahmadnagar District. This genealogy is as follows :-
गोविंद दीक्षित
सीव दीक्षित
गंगाराम दीक्षित (मौजे निवडुंगे ताा) शेवगांव येथील मोकासे अमलाचा मूळसंपादक)
नीलकंठ दीक्षित

महादेव दीक्षित
गोपाल दीक्षित
रंगशास्त्री नारायणशास्त्री केशव दीक्षित विष्णु दीक्षित
A comparison of the above genealogy with that given by Siva
Dikşita in 1746 A. D. shows that the names of Thrones and his son
fata are common to both these genealogies. The earlier and the
later fragmeat of genealogy being thus riveted at two joints, the
accuracy and continuity of the genealogy of the Chaudhari family
from Govinda (c. A.D. 1600), the father of Nilakantha Caturdhara,
up to A. D. 1854 is now proved beyond challenge.
Three days before the composition of the work Dharmatattva-
prakasa by Sivadikşita at Paithaņa the Maratha King Shahu gave a
village as inam to Gangārāma Dikşita, the son of Siva Dikşita-on
Wednesday, 6th August 1746. The Sanad in respect of this inām is

Furnished by the December 1927. - Diksita, oft
reproduced in the Appendix to this paper from a certified copy of
it furnished by the Alienation Record Office, Poona, to Mr. S. V.
Chaudhari on 16th December 1927. In this Sanad Gangārāma
Dikşita is described as the son of Siva Dikşita, of the surname
Chaudhari, gotra Gotam, Sūtra Asvalāyana, hailing from Benares,
then resident at Paithana. Gangārāma Dikşita obtained this Sanad
through the good offices of Fattesing Bhosale (A. D. 1707-1760)
who was regarded by Shahu as his own son.
The names in the genealogy reconstructed and recorded above
are supported and supplemented by the Tryambakeśvara Records'
referred to by me already. Mr. V. V. Meghashyam who possesses
these records states in his letter to Mr. S. V. Chaudhari dated 30th
April 1911 that he has in his possession some writing of Nilakantha
Dikşita, son of Gangārāma Dikşita dated Saka 1706 = A. D. 1784.
This date is consistent with King Shahu's Sanad to Gangārāma
Dikşita issued in A. D. 1746.

Hall in his Bibliography' states that Nilakapțba " resided at
the village of Kurpar, now called Koópar to the west of the river
Godavari, near the temples of Sukreśvara and Kaceśvara in Mahā.
raştra”. The above statement occurs in Hall's description of a
Ms of the Vedāntakataka. I have no means of verifying it but pre-
suming that the topography of the residence of Nilakantha at Koper.
gaum recorded above is based on any references in the Vedānta-
kataka itself, I have to point out that in the description of Koper-
gaum in the Bombay Gazetteerd we find a reference to the temple of
Kaceśvara as follows :-
“In the elbow of the Godavari and surrounded on three sides
by its bed stands a fortified cut-stone enclosure (65' x 58' x 60)
with massive black walls. It has one gate but the side towards the
river is open. In the centre is the cenotaph or thadge, a very small
work of timber and brick upon a coarse stone plinth with no writ-
ing or ornament. Near the site of the old palace in the island
stands the temple of Kacesoara a set of plain modern buildings held
in great honour." The editor of the Bombay Gazetteer in a foot-
note on the above passage records "the local story of the Kacesvara
temple " which is the same as the story of Kaca and the Devayani
found in the Purāņas. This footnote is concluded with the re-
mark: "To this day a stone Shukra and Kach sit side by side on
the island and receive much worship."
If the images of Sukra and Kaca are still worshipped on the is-
land at Kopergaum they must be identical with those in the
temples of Kaceśvara and Sukresvara referred to by Hall in 1859.
If Hall's remarks are based on Nilakaộtha's own statement we
shall not be wrong in supposing that the residence of Nilakantha

2. Vol. XVII (Ahmadnagar) 1884, p. 723 - Kopargaum is 60
miles north of Ahmadnagar. It is on the north bank of the Godāvari.
It was the 'favourite residence of Raghunātha Rao Peshwa. In an
island in the Godavari there were two palaces which have been pulled
down and sold. Raghunatha Rao Peshwa died at Hingani three miles
off and his cenotaph is still at this place......... In 1818 Kopargaum was
occupied by Madras troops. In the Marathi ballads (STTOGT) by
Parasarāma ( Ed. by V. N. Kolharkar, Bombay, 1924) there is a refe.
rence to 47 and ge at Kopargaum-Vide Pp. 38-39 ( asteroit ) -"TE

Raghoba Dada Peshwa on the island. Parasaram belongs to the last
quarter of the 19th century,

at Kopergaum was near these temples situated on the island in the
elbow of the Godavari. This tentative suggestion regarding the
topography of the house of the Chaudhari family at Kopergaum
say about A. D. 1750 nceds to be verified on the strength of other
contemporary evidence.'
We have already referred to the three brothers? of Nilakantha
viz. (1) शिव, (2) कृष्ण and (3) त्र्यम्बक. All these brothers were
1. Siva Diksita in his धर्मतत्त्वप्रकाश composed in A. D. 1746 states
in the following verse that Govinda Caturdhara, the father of Nila-
kantha lived at Kūrpara town on the bank of the Godāvari, where
stood in the centre कवि and कच:-
"विख्याते कविकचमध्यवर्ति-
गोदोदक्तीरे नगरमहिम्नि कुराख्ये
गोविंदः श्रुतिनयसिन्धुपारश्वा
श्रीचातुर्धरकुलमण्डनं पुरासीत् ॥" .
This reference to कवि ( = शुक्राचार्य ) and कच by the grandson of Nila.
kantha leaves no doubt that the Chaudhari family had its residence
near the temples of Kaceśvara and Sukreśvara on the island at
Kopergaum referred to in the the Bombay Gazetteer.
2. Vide Ms No. 1523 of Nilakantha's commentary on the Hari-
vamśa described by Weber in his Catalogue of Berlin Mss, Vol. II
(1886), pp. 112-113. In the following verses Nilakantha refers to his
native place कूर्परप्राम, his gotra गौतम, his surname चतुर्धर, his father
गोविंद, his mother फुल्लाम्बिका and his younger brother शिव, कृष्ण and
व्यम्बक:-
"ज्ञानाचार्यमिवोत्तमोत्तमकचास्या तद्वया गौतमी

The above verses have been discussed by Wilhelm Printz in his
Inaugural Dissertation : " Bhāsa-Worter in Nalakantha's Bhārata-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
younger than Nilakantha. It remains to be investigated if theso
brothers left any descendants, whose lines could be traced among
the present members of the Chaudhari family residing either in
the Mahārāştra or outside.'
From the data recorded above the following facts regarding
Nilakantha's family and its subsequent history become clear :-
(1) Nilakantha mentions his own gotra “Gautama” which
is the gotra of Mr. S. V. Chaudhari, the present Registrar of
the Law College, Poona. This gotra has been recorded in
King Shahu's grant of A. D. 1746 to Gargārāma, the great
grandson of Nīlakaộtha.
(2) The genealogy of Nilakantha's family as given by his
grandson Siva Dikșita has been linked up with the genealogy filed
with the Inam Commission in A. D. 1851 by Mr. Vāmana Siva
Dikşita, who is the 6th in descent from Nilakantha Caturdhara.
(3) The surname Chaudhari now current in the family was
also current in Nilakantha's time as Nilkantha in his work com-
posed in A. D. 1680 calls himself " Bau Tio Fug."
(4) The place of residence of Nilakantha's father Govinda
was somewhere near the temples of Sukresvara and Kaceśvara on
the island of the river Godāvari at Kopergaum. Siva Dikşita, the
grandson of Nilakantha, refers to these images of Fola ( = 7%) and
at in his work composed in A. D. 1746. The memory of this resi.
dence may have then been fresh in the mind of Nilakantha's
grandson.
(5) From Kopergaum the members of the family of Nila-
kaņţha Govinda Chaudhari migrated to i Shrigonde, Pathardi,
1. Mr. S. Chitrav states that the descendants of Nilkantha are
now residing at Benares (Vide p. 499 of Madhyayugina Caritrakośa,
Poona, 1937).
2. Even Nilakantha seems to refer to go and on the island
of the Godavari in the following line of verse 1 from his commentary
on the Harivansa which I have quoted above :-
"ज्ञानाचार्यमिवोत्तमोत्तमकचास्या तद्वया गौतमी"
Here ज्ञानाचार्य-शुक्राचार्य - कवि mentioned by Siva Diksita, गौतमी-Driver
Godåvari. mentioned in the above line is also mentioned by Siva
Dikşita. So in Nilkaņtha's ļiąe the images of Y and $* stood on the
bank of the Godavart.

Nivaquage and Paithana in the Ahmadnagar district or near its
border and settled there. The education of the early descendants
of Nīlakaņķha upto A. D. 1750 or so appears to have been carried
out at Benares. Perhaps the contact with Benares lessened after
Shahu's grant of the village Nivaļunge to Gangārāma in A. D.
1746.
(6) It remains to be seen if any member of this Chaudhari
family composed any important work after the composition of
the Dharmatattva prakāśa by Nilakantha's grandson Siva Dikșita'
in A. D. 1746. Perhaps with a settled life in the Ahmadnagar
District the ambition for achieving eminence in the literary sphere,
80 characteristic of Nilakantha's life did not stir up the Chaudharis
to take to learned pursuits in the manner of their illustrious
ancestor.
P.S. -- After this paper was completed I happened to read a
lettere nf A. D. 1683 addressed to one artizio girerar by die stiera
from Benares. In this letter one “Thãe zima anat” is mentioned
as the son-in-lawof the addressee artrato atrava. This letter is
addressed to alt120 tiga then in Konkan according to Mr.
Pimputkar. In the preamble of this the writer informs are alrea
the father-in-law of " ta airera aiust" as follows:-
"I took your leave and came to Benares. Thereafter your son-
in-law Govinda Dikșita Chaudhari wss approached by certain Vaidika
Brahman Pandits who bore so ne rivalry to him. They said to him
that they would no longer bear any feelings of rivalry to him if he

possed one of his works in A. D. 1680. If this identification is
accepted it shows that in A. D. 1683 Nilakantha's son Govinda
was already a married man, holding some status in Benares society
of Mahārāştra and other Brahmans. The letter also reveals for
the first time the name of the father-in-law of Nilakantha's son.

his name was arrya atreza."

The above genealogy has been reconstructed by me on the strength
of manuscripts of the works of the Nilakantha Caturdhara and other
members of his family. It is correct so far as the main line is con-
cerned but needs more evidence for the verification of names in the
branch-lines. 'Some names have been inserted in the above gencalogy
on the strength of extracts from the records of priests at Trymbake.
Svara as they were sent to me by Mr. Sadashiv Vishnu Chaudhari, the

the above genealogy that there is unbroken continuity of descent from

56. Some contemporary Manuscripts of the
Works of Nīlakaņţha Caturdhara, the
Commentator of the Mahābhārata –
Between A. D. 1687 and 1695*
In my paper' on Nilakantha Caturdhara, the commentator of
the Mahabharata I have recorded the following contemporary Mss
of Nilakantha's works :-
A. D. 1687 - Ms of pregatirət dated Saka 1609 - A. D. 1687
(p. 94 of Cata, of Vangiya Sahitya Parişat, Calcutta, 1935).
A. D. 1691 -Berlin Ms of भारतभावदीप belonging to गोविंद चतुर्धर
(Weber p. 107).
In August 1943 Messers R. D. Kamat and D. D. Kamat of
Bombay presented to the B. O. R. Institute about 100 Mss in
memory of their father the late Mr. Divakar Bhalchandra Kamata
whose interest in Sanskrit literature was reponsible for the collec-
tion of these Mss. In this Kamat collection I find the following con-
temporary Ms of Nilakantha's commentary on the Mahābhārata :-
* Journal of S. M. Library, Tanjore, :Vol. IV, No. 1, pp. 1-7.
Vide pp. 146–161 of the Silver Jubilee Volume of the Annals (B.O.
R. Institute), 1942.
2. Mr. D. B. Kamat B.A. (Allahabad ), B.T. (Dacca) was the
Headmaster of Govt. High school at Osmanabad (Nizam's State ).
Sanskrit was one of his subjects for his degree examination at the
Maharaja's College, Jaipur. From 1912 to 1927 he was at Aurangabad
as Inspector of Schools. During his inspection tours in the whole of
the Marathwada he collected many old Mss from the neighbourhood
of Aurangabad and Parabhani Districts of the Nizam's State. He had
collected all the M8s now at the B. O. R. Institute with the idea of
studying them after his retirement but unfortunately he died at.
Osmanabad on 16th August 1934. Between 1927 and 1934 he was at
Raichur, from which place he was transferred to Osmanabad in May
1934. (I am thankful to Mr. R. D. Kamat for sending me the forego-
ing particulars regarding his father's interest in Sanskrit M88 now
with the Institute - P. K. Gode).

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY:
Vanaparvan ( folios 439) containing the text and Nilakantha's
commentary on it. The Ms was copied in Samvat 1751 -(A. D.
1695 ) as will be seen from the following colophon - Folio 4394 –
"संवत् १७५१ भाद्रपद शुद्ध ९।
श्रीविक्रमार्कशरदिंदुशराद्रिभूमौ १७५१
श्रीभ्यंबकेण रघुनाथसुतेन काश्याम् ।
श्रीनीलकंठकृतभारतभावदीपो
श्रीशंकरार्पणधिया लिखितः सनाभिः ॥ १ ॥"
It is clear from the above extract that this Ms W.is copied at
Benares by Tryambaka, the son of Raghunātha in A, D. 1695. On
folio 4398 we find the endorsement 'aagaf 832 g Tepatearetiitae
which is in the same hand as the four-lined stanza in the above
extract. Most probably Tryambaka, the copyist, prepared this
copy for his father Raghunātha.'
I have already pointed out that Nilakantha composed his fata-
arusaciat in A. D. 1680 and his statirattast at Benares in A. D.
1693. In view of these dates the Mss of his works copied in A. D.
1687, 1691 and 1695 are contemporary copies and hence valuable
for a critical edition of his commentary HITHI519, portions of
which are represented by these dated Mss.
In the list of Nilakaņțha's works recorded by Aufrechta no
work of the name 'faytrurararat' is found. There is, however,
a Ms of it in the library of the Oriental Institute, Baroda. It is
described by Pandit K. S. Ramaswami Sastri Siromani in his Cata-
logue of Mss of Srauta.Sūtras and Prayogas (Des. Cata. of Mss
Vol. II, 1942, G. O. S. No. XCVI) on page 79 as follows :-
" No. 526 fayrrarafaat by Caturdhara Nilakantha son of
Govinda Dīksita - Śaka 1794 -- Place of orgin:- age.”
1. But this suggestion becomes doubtful as the words ' gata
qogaet' are written as a correction in bold hand superimposed on
some previously written words hidden by the application of yellow
pigment.

The B. O. R. 1. Ms of the Vanatarvan (Kamat collection)
was copied at Benares by one sya son of Raghunatha in Samvat
1751 = A. D. 1695. As regards the identification of this copyist
sa tgary I have to put forth the following hypothesis :-
यंत्रक रघुनाथ may be identified with त्र्यंबक रघुनाथ हणमंते, the son of
TareT ATTIETOT Hài (A. D. 1653-1683 ) the celebrated minister of

These titles of works ascribed to our author show him to be a

ster of Acyutadevaraya of Vijayanagar ( 1529-1542). According to
the genealogy recorded in the edition of the Bhäffacintamani Kuțţi
Kavi ( = Vāñcheśvara ) was born in A. D. 1780 and died in 1860
evidently at an advanced age of about 80 yeaas. If these dates are
correct he must have been about 36 years old when the British
Resident at Poona (M. Elphinstone ) issued to him a pass-port on
26th November 1816 permitting him to pass without molestation to
Rāmeśvaram. This pass-port is historically important as it enables
us to know for the first time the contact of Kuțţi Kavi with the
Patvardhan Sardars of the Southern Maratha Country. This pass-
port bears No. 292 of the Poona Residency and mentions the
bearer as " in the Service of Mhadhow Row Purshuram Patwar.
dhun." It allows the bearer to carry with him a Dooly, a camel,
six Tuttus, five armed men and five followers. Pandit Aryasvāmi
informs' us that this and other pass-ports were issued to Kuți
Kavi while he was returning from Benares and during his halt at
Poona, Dharwar and also at the village Cinchini, where he was
honoured by Madhavrao Parashuram Patwardhan. He stayed with
the Patvard hans upto 1818 and then started for Mysore. This in-
formation is corroborated not by the Bhāļļacintāmaņi but by the
Hiranyakeši Srautasütravyākhyāl which was composed in response
to a request from the ministers of the Patwardhans as stated by
him in verses' 12 to 22 at the beginning of the Hiranyakešišrauta-

and who states that he copied by order of "Meherban Bular Saheb "
who is identical with Dr. G. Bühler, vide folios 46b (or 1116 — "gía

which reads :-"Fet a festù giar gh7979 577 74 aart worst sta."
It is clear, therefore, that the original Ms of the commentary belong-
ed to one Sakho Anant Limaye. His identity with a minister of the
Patvardhan Sardar would be discussed in this paper on the strength
of evidence furnished by the above commentary.

aware of the surname feste current in the Deccan. .

caste and whose first great ancestor was known by the name Hari
(v. 13). He obtained the glory of Kingship by the grace of god
Gapesa' and had an illustrious son by name Ramacandral (v. 14).
He obtained unparalleled princely glory from the Sovereign. He
had a son with a highly religious mind called.Parasurama" (v. 15).
He protected his kingdom like King Dasaratha of old - a kingdom
which extended from the river Tungabhadrâ to the river Godå and
was conquered by his valour (v. 16). He has four son8 renowned
in all quarters. Prince Rāmacandra, endowed with all good quali-
ties, is the first of them (v. 17). His brother is Hari, who is devot.
ed to the worship of Gods and Brahmanas. His brother is Maba-
deva by name. He is agted for his kindness to all beings (v. 18).
His brother's name is Ganapati, who is very much praised (by the
people ) and who has, as his ministers, many highly moral and reli-
gious personages (v. 19) like Sakhārām and others. This Sakhi.
ram is a Brahman of Kapi gotya" and surnamed Limaye and is equal-
ly religious like the other minister of the name Fog (v. 20). He
belongs to the Satyāşadha Sūtra and is devoted to duties in accor-
dance with Sruti and Smſti. It was his wish, “I should write a
commentary on the Sūtra ( Hiraṇyakešísūtra ) following the Veda-
bhåşya and easy to understand. In accordance with this wish I
have gladly undertaken to write this commentary but where am I,
a person of small intellect as compared with the Sütra, which has
come directly from the mouth of the sage ( muni)?" (v8. 21-22).
In view of the details furnished by Kuțți Kavi in the foregoing
verses it is clear that the credit of the composition of the commen.
tary on the Hiranyakesisutra must go to a great extent to Mr.
Sakhāram Limaye, the minister (amātya) of Mahadevabhațţa Pat-
vardhan as it was at his request that our author commenced the

composition of this work. We must now examine the date of
composition of this commentary.
According to Burnell' this commentary was "written about
1800 A. D." Aufrecht also repeats this statement about the
date of this commentary. Burnell's statement is, however, wrong
as it is directly contradicted by the date of commencement
of the work recorded in verse 31 by Kuțți Kavi himself. This
date corresponds to A. D. 1816 ( Saka 1738).' The question now
arises : What period of time was required by our author to com-
plete this voluminous commentary on the Hiranyakešisütra and in
what year it was completed by him? This question can be answer-
ed on the strength of the following extract on folio 43b ( 2666 seri-
ally ) of Ms No. 16 of 1866-68 of this commentary :-
" वांछेश्वरसुधीभिश्च वेदशास्त्रप्रवर्तकः ।
साक्षात् व्यासस्वरुपैश्च कृतीयं अन्यविस्तरः ॥१॥
1. Cata. of Tanjore Mss, Part I, 1879, p. 21. Būrnell gives
extracts from the beginning and end of the M8 described by him. In
these extracts we do not find the verse containing the year in which
the composition of the commentary was begun by Kutši Kavi. This
verse as recorded in the B. O. R. I. Ms No. 16 of 1866-68 reads
as follows:
"वस्वन्य(न्य )दिक्षितिमिते शके वांछेश्वरः सुधीः।
हिरण्यकेशिनां सूत्रं व्याख्यातुमुपचक्रमे ॥३१॥
The chronogram 79, HA, B12, farfa gives us Sake 1738 = A. D. 1816
as the year in which Kuțţi Kavi states, he began the composition of
the commentary. This date is in harmony with the date of the pass-
port given to Kuţți Kavi by M. Elphinstone, the British resident at
Poona on 26th November 1816. In this pass-port Kuţti Kavi is stated
to be in the service of Mahadevabhațța Patvardhan, the son of
Parashuramabhau Patvardhan.
2. Cata. Catalo, I, 766.
3. In the Tanjore Catalogue, Vol. IV, p. 1929, p. 1687 the correct
date of the commencement of the commentary represented by the
chronogram “afata fra " is mentioned and the discrepancy of this
date with the date given by Burnell has been: also mentioned. No re-
ference has, however, been recorded in this description to the date
of completion ( A. D. 1828 ) of the commentary found recorded in
B. O. R. I, M8 No. 16 of 1866-68.

शके १७५० सर्वधारी नाम संवत्सरे मागशीर्षकृष्णाष्टम्यां इंदुवासरे समापितं ॥"
This extract is obviouly recorded by Pitambara who wrote
down to dictation this commentary as composed by Vāñcheśvara
and delivered orally ( angeferat 7877). It was completed in Saka
1750 (= A. D. 1828) on Monday 8th tithi, Krsnapakşa of the
month of Märgašīrşa, the name of the Samvatsara being Sarva-
dhari. We do not know the place where the completion of the
commentary was effected. It is, however, certain that a work
commenced by Kutti Kavi in A. D. 1816 was completed by him
after full 12 years in A. D. 1828. The statement of Mr. Vyankaji
Narayana Ghaļsāší which follows the above extract reads as
follows:
"सखोपंत दादा लिमये यांचा पुस्तकावरून नकल तयार केली मासे।
शके १७८९ प्रभव नाम संवत्सरे चैत्र कृष्ण ४ चतुा भोमवासरे तारीख २६ माहे
अप्रेल सन १८६७ इसवी रोजी नकल लिहिणार व्यंकाजी नारायण घळसाशी
थाने लिखितं ॥ श्री कृष्णार्पणमस्तु ॥"
Mr. Ghalsāsī states on 23rd April 1867 that he completed his
copy from the original Ms belonging to one सखोपंत दादा लिमये.
Elsewhere (on folio 390 or 305° serially) he refers to this owner of
Ms as सखो अनंत लिमये. It is very much probable that Sakhopant
Limaye whose Ms was copied for Dr. Bühler is identical with
1. The sheet at the beginning of the M8 which records the
मन्त्रसंख्या contains the following endorsement:--"तारीख २२ माहे में सन
१८६७ इसवी रोजी नकल समाप्त झाली असे हस्ते व्यंकाजी नारायण क-हाडकर." Evi-
dently this appendix was prepared on 22nd May 1867. Folio 65
records the date 2nd April 1867 and the scribe calls himself
"कन्हाटकक्षेत्रस्थ." Folio 46 records the date 25th March 1867, Folio
75, 4th June 1867, Folio 37, 17th April 1867, Folio 43-23rd April
1867, Folio 58-8th may 1867 copied at अष्टे ("अष्टे येथे समापित"), Folio
56-21st May,1867. These dates show that the Ms was being copied
From March to Tune 1867 at the village अष्ट [from the copy of सखो
अनंत लिमये as stated by the scribe on folio 58 (सप्तमप्रश्न)]. The B.O. R.
Institute acquired in 1938 about 450 Mss from Mr. Shambhurao
Govinda Limaye of 072. It is probable that he belongs to the family
of सखो अनंत लिमये referred to above.

Sakhāram Limaye of Kapi Gotra living in A.D. 1816 and acting as an
amātya or minister to Mahadeva Parashuram Patvardhan. It seems,
however, possible that a copy of the commentary in question com-
menced in A. D. 1816 and completed in A. D. 1828 by Kutti Kavi
was given to Sakharanf Limaye and it was from this original con-
temporary copy that Bühler's copy i. e. No. 16 of 1866-68 was
made and completed on 23rd April 1867.
It is now clear that the Hiranyakešisútravyakhya was composed
between A. D. 1813 and 1828 and was not composed " about A. D.
1800" as stated by Dr. Burnell.

We have already mentioned a work called the Dattacintämani
among the list of works composed by Kuțți Kavi. This is a treatise
dealing with adoption. In the beginning of this work he tells us
that he composed the following works':-
(1) "विवृत्ति शतकस्य" i.e.commentary on the माहिष शतक compos-
ed by his grandfather, (2)" हिरण्यकेशीसूत्रस्य विवृति", (3) "काकतालीय-
वादार्थ" (4) “निर्गयो मलमासस्य'' and (5) दत्तचिन्तामणि.
Let us now try to fix the relative chronology of some of the
works of Kutti Kavi on the basis of evidence recorded in this
paper. The following tabular statement will be of some use in
fixing the relative chronology in question :-

In verse 10 at the beginning of the Hiranyakesisutradyåkhya
Kuțți Kavi calls himself " HESHTATadq96: ". If we understand this
epithet to refer to his composition of hratacuru we shall have to
look upon the Hatarauja as earlier than A. D. 1816. With refe-
rence to item Nos. 4, 5 and 7 to 11 the chronology indicated is
only probable as the Mss of these works are not before me and
hence I have no means of making a closer study of the problem of
their exact chronology. I may, however, note here the M8s of the
works of Kuțți kavi mentioned by Aufrecht. These are as follows:
(1) Ferrararo' -- dh. by Vāñchesvara, son of Narasimha Hz.
1091. 1528 ( Vide CC III, 53 ).
(2) HETEPATAFO - No M8s recorded by Aufrecht. The
Madras Edition of this work of 1934 is based on a rare Ms.
(3) Itata aceptan - Burnell 164* ( Vide CC I, 444) and BC
434 (CC III, 96 ).
(4) Varattater - Hz. 2, p. 144 (CC III, 19).
(5) HHTATOTTS -- Hz, 1528 p. 144 (CC III, 93).
(6) eneratafor -- Some works of this name are mentioned
by Aufrecht but none is ascribed to Vāñcheśvara.
(Continued from the previous page)
"No. 1528 is a copy of Dattacintamani, a work on the same subject
by Vañcheśvara, the son of Narasimha or Nșsiṁha, grandson of
Mādhava and great grandson of another Vāñcheśvara. He also wrote
a commentary on his great-grandfather's Māhişaśataka (Tanjore
Cata. p. 164 ), a commentary on the whole Hiranyakešīsūtra ( a por-
tion of this is found in No. 682), a logical work entitled Käkatāliya-
vädärtha and the Malamāsanirnaya. Accørding to the colophon of
No. 682, his great-grandfather, whose name was likewise Váncheśvara,
had been the minister of ( the Maratha king ) Tukoji of the family of
Bhosala. Govindadikşita, an ancestor of Vancheśvara had been the
prime-minister of Raghunātha, one of the (Nayaka) rulers of Tanja-
pura (Tanjore )."
1. Mentioned by Kane: Hist. of Dharma., I, 557.
2. Ibid. p. 601.
3. Not mentioned by Mr. Kane, who mentions works of this
game by Vācaspatimiśra and Sivarāma. On p. 736 Mr. Kane refers
to Kurti Kavi as ,, वश्वेश्वर, son of नरसिंह, author of दतचितामणि and मल.
Htelaren." The correct name appears to be "atsapT" (=ator19)

On the basis of the evidence recorded in this paper the follow-
ing conclusions may be arrived at :-
(1) The literary activity of Kuțți Kavi lies mainly between
A. D. 1816 and 1840 or so.
(2) The commentary on the Hiranyakesi sütra was commenced
by him in A. D. 1816 and completed in A. D. 1828.
(3) Kutti Kavi gives us a genealogy of the Patvardhan Sar-
dars of the Southern Maratha Country at the beginning of the com.
mentary on the Hiranyakešīsūtra. This genealogy is correct so
far as it goes.
(4) Kuțţi Kavi composed the above commentary at the ex-
press desire of Sakharam Limaye of kapi gotra, whom he describes
as the amåtya or minister of Mahadeva Parashu ram Patvardhan.
The surname of another minister mentioned by him is Jog, who
needs identification.
(5) Sakharam Limaye mentioned by Kuțți Kavi as amdtya
appears to be identical' with Sakho Ananta Limaye of Aşte (Dist.
1. My surmise about this identity has since been corroborated
by the genealogy of the Limaye Family of Aste, kindly sent by Mr.
Shambhurao Limaye on 7th July 1939. I reproduce below only the
pertinent portion of this genealogy :-
Ananta
Sakhārama ( 5 Sons )

A. D. 1816 to 1835)

Satara) who was a Fadnis or Finance minister of the Patvardhans
with his native place at Aste ( Astekar ), The B. 0. R. Institute
acquired in 1938 about 450 M8s from Mr. Shambhurao Govind
Limaye of Aște, who is evidently descended from Sakhopant
Dädā or Sakho Anant Limaye. This Limaye collection contains
M88 with the endorsements that they belonged to Sakho Ananta
Limaye Aştekar Fadnis. These endorsements are dated A. D.
1829, 1831, 1833, 1834 and 1835.
(6) The B. O. R. Institute Ms No. 16 of 1866-68 of the
Hiranyakesisútravyakhya by Kutti Kavi was copied for Dr. Bühler
between March and June 1867 at Aste from the original belonging
to Sakho Anant Limaye and dated A. D. 1828, the date of comple.
tion of the commentary.
(7) Of the eleven works known to have been composed by
Kuțţi Kavi, M88 of about six have been traced and recorded in
Catalogues. An effort should be made to locate the M88 of the
remaining five works.
(8) For the present the relative chronology of only three
works has been established in this paper, according to which the
Hirapyakedtsütraoyakhyd ( begun in A. D. 1816 and finished in A.D.
1828 ) was started first. The Dattacintämani which mentions this
commentary was composed later while the Bhattacintamapi, which
mentions both the above works is evidently the 3rd work in this
order. The Malamåsanirnaya may have been composed before A.D.
1816 as Kuțți Kavi calls himself “Malamāsanirnayapatu" in the
above commentary. The remaining works are not mentioned in this
commentary, an omission which may suggest that they were com-
posed after A. D. 1816. This point, however, needs further inve-
stigation.
. (9) Kuțți Kavi :was a very learned man. Judging by the
details recorded in the several pags-ports issued to him by Mount
Stuart Elphinstone, the British Resident at Poona in A. D. 1816 and
other officers, Kuțți Kavi appears to have been very influential
as well.

that the Aşte branch of the Limaye Family originally hailed from the
village Somesvara near Ratnagiri. The Someśvara line was styled as
. Dharmadhikari Limaye." I intend to publish an account of Sakho
Ananta Limaye and his interest in Sanskrit Msg along with my list
of the Mss in the Limaye collection acquired by the B.O.R. Institute,

P.S. - The following further colophons containing references
to Sakhopant Limaye are found in the Mss of the Limaye collec-
tion:-
Ms of मांडक्योपनिषद्भाष्य-dated Saka 1316 (A. D. 1824)-
"मांडूक्योपनिषदायलेखन यदि पुस्तके । श्री सखोपंत लिमये ज्ञानमार्ग प्रदर्शकः "

___"सख नाम्न इति ख्यातस्त्वन्मुक्तिः पाठयेद्बुधैः"

"दादाभिधान लिमये सखपत नाम ।

Sakhopant appears to have been a pioneer in the work of col.
lection and preservation of Mss, later started in 1866 by the Bom-
bay Government.
