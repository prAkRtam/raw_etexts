SINGHI JAINA SERIES
[A Short History Of The Series]
IT is with great pleasure that I place before the public the present Volume which
forms no. 15 of the Singhi Jaina Series The following few lines describe how
the Series came to be inaugurated
Babu Sri Dalchandji Singhi, in whose sacred memory the present Series is
inaugurated, was born in Azimganj (Murshidabad) in the Vikrama Samvat 1921
(1865 A D ), and died in Calcutta on the 30th December, 1927 The Singhı family
of Azimganj occupies almost the foremost rank among the few hundred Taina families
who migrated to Bengal from Rajputana in the latter part of the 18th century and
took their domicile in the district of Murshidabad The family rose to its present
position and prominence chiefly through the energy and enterprise of that self-made
man, Babu Dalchandji Singhi.
Owing to financial difficulties, Dalchandji Singhi had abruptly to cut short
his educational career and join the family business at the early age of 14 The family
had been carrying on business in the name of Messrs Hurisingh Nehalchand for a
long time though, in those days, it was not at all a prominent firm. But having taken
the reins of the firm in his own hands, Babu Dalchandji Singhi developed it on a very
large scale, and it was mainly through his business acumen, industry, perseverance
and honesty that this comparatively unknown firm of "Hurisingh Nehalchand" came
to be reckoned as the foremost jute concern with branches in almost all the important
jute centres of Bengal The fruits of Dalchandji Singhi's toils were immense and the
reputation of the firm in commercial circles was indeed unique.

Page 10****************************************************************************************

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
Having thus brought his jute business to the most flourishing condtion, Babu
Dalchandji Singhi diverted his attention to the mineral resources of India and spent
many lacs of rupees in prospecting the coal fields of Korea State (CP), limestone
deposits of Sakti State and Akaltara, and the bauxite deposits of Belgaum and
Sawantwadı and Ichalkaranji States His scheme for the Hiranyakeshi Hydro.
Electric Project and manufacture of aluminium from bauxite ores, the first of its
nature in India, is yet to be developed His mining firm, Messrs Dalchand Bahadur
Singh is reputed to be one of the foremost colliery proprietors in India While so
engaged in manifold business, he also acquired and possessed vast zamındary estates
spreading over the districts of 24-Perganas, Rangpur, Purnea, Maldah, etc.
But the fame of Babu Dalchandji Singhi was not confined to his unique
position in commercial circles He was equally well-known for his liberality and
large-heartedness, though he always fought shy of publicity attached to charitable
acts and often remained anonymous while feeding the needy and patronizing the poor
A few instances of his liberality are given below
When Mahatma Gandhi personally visited his place in 1926, for a contribu-
tion to the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Babu Dalchandji Singhi gladly handed over to
him a purse of Rs 10,000.
His War contribution consisted in his purchasing War Bonds to the value
of Rs. 3,00,000, and his contribution at the Red Cross Sales held in March, 191, under
the patronage of H E. Lord Carmichael on Government House grounds, Calcutta,
amounted to approximately Rs. 21,000, in which he paid Rs 10,000 for only one bale
of jute which he had himself contributed His anonymous donations are stated to
have amounted to more than one lac of rupees
In his private life Babu Dalchandji Singhi was a man of extremely simple
and unostentatious habits Plain living and high thinking was his ideal Although
he had been denied a long academic career, his knowledge, erudition and intellectual
endowments were of a very high order indeed. His private studies were vast and
constant His attitude towards life and world was intensely religious, and yet he held
very liberal views and had made a synthetic study of the teachings of all religions.
He was also well-versed in the Yoga-darśana During the latter part of his life he
spent his days mostly in pilgrimage and meditation Noted throughout the district
and outside for his devoutness, kindness and piety, he is remembered even now as a
pride of the Jaina community
During the last days of his life, Babu Dalchandji Singhi cherished a strong
desire to do something towards encouraging research into important works of Jaina
literature and publishing their editions scientifically and critically prepared by
eminent scholars But fate had decreed otherwise, and before this purpose of his
could become a reality, he expired.

Page 11****************************************************************************************
SINGHI JAINA SERIES
However, Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi, worthy son of the worthy father,
in order to fulfil the noble wish of the late Dalchandji Singhi, continued to help
institutions like the Jaina Pustaka Pracāraka Mandala, Agra, the Jaina Gurukula,
Palitana , the Jaina Vidyabhavana, Udaipur etc , and also patronized many individual
scholars engaged in the publication of the Jaina literature Besides, with a view
to establishing an independent memorial foundation to perpetuate the memory of
his father, he consulted our common friend, Pandit Sri Sukhlalji, an unrivalled
scholar of Taina Philosophy and professor of Jainism in the Benares Hindu
University, who had also come in close contact with the late Babu Dalchandjı
Singhi, and whom the latter had always held in very high esteem In the
meanwhile, Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi incidentally met the great Poet Rabindranath
Tagore and learnt of his desire to get a chair of Jaina studies established in the
Visva-Bharatı, Santiniketan Out of his respect for the Poet, Sjt Bahadur Singhji
readily agreed to found the desired chair for three years in revered memory of
his dear father, and invited me to take charge of the same I accepted the offer
very willingly and felt thankful for the opportunity of spending even a few years
in the cultural and inspiring atmosphere of Visva-Bharatı, the grand creation of
the great Poet Rabindranath.
During the period of 10 years of my principalship of the Gujarat Purătattva
Mandır, Ahmedabad, and even before that period, I had begun collecting materials
of historical and philological importance, and of folk-lore etc, which had been lying
hidden in the great Jaina Bhandars of Pātan, Ahmedabad, Baroda, Cambay, etc.
I induced my noble friend Babu Bahadur Singhjı Singhi, the great lover of literature
and culture, also to start a series which would publish works dealing with the vast
materials in my possession, and also with other allied important Jaina texts and
studies prepared along the most modern scientific methods Hence the inauguration
of the present Singhi Jaina Series.
Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi is himself a great connoisseur and patron of
art and culture He has an unbounded interest in creative researches in antiquities,
and has a very good collection of rare and historic paintings, manuscripts, coins,
books, and jewelleries. On many occasions the organisers of various exhibitions
throughout India have had to call upon him for loan of his art collection, and he has
gladly responded to their requests without fail In 1931 he was the recipient of a
gold medal from the Hindı Sahitya Sammelan as a mark of appreciation of his unique
collection He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (London), a member of
the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal ; Bangiya Sahitya Parishat, the Indian Research
Institute and many other similar institutions He is also one of the Founder-
membrs of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Bombay. He was one of the prominent
working members of the Executive body of the "All-India Exhibition of Indian
Architecture and Allied Arts and Crafts” held in Calcutta in February, 1935.
Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi is a prominent leader of the Swetambar Jaina
community. He was elected President of the "Jaina Swetambar Conference" held

Page 12****************************************************************************************
IV
BEĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
in Bombay in 1926. He is also connected with many other Jaina conferences and
institutions either as president, patron or trustee.
Though thus a leading figure in the Jaina community, Babu Bahadur
Singhji Singhı has always maintained a truly national and non-sectarian spirit and
helped also many institutions which are outside the Jaina fold. For example, he has
donated Rs. 12,500 for constructing a building at Allahabad for the Hındı Sahitya
Parishat. In fact his generosity knows no distinction of colour or community.
The present Series, which is the fruit of enlightened liberality of Babu
Bahadur Singhji Singhi, and commemorates the name of the late Dalchandji Singhi,
aims at publishing critical editions of the most important works of Jaina literature
in particular, and Indian literature in general, and studies by competent research
scholars. I hope the Series will be welcome to Indologists and appreciated by
the general public interested in the glorious literary heritage of India.

PREFACE BY THE GENERAL EDITOR.
My learned friend Shriyut Mohanlal D Desai has prepared in deference to
my wishes this excellent edition of Bhānucandra Caritra. It is a piece of his
selfless service which he undertook to render with willingness and vigour. I take
this opportunity of sincerely congratulating him for this. He is a sound scholar
and an able writer of the subjects allied to Jaina History and Literature. A brief
history of Jaina Literature and five big Volumes entitled Jarno Gurjara Kaviomall
of them in Gujarati are thoroughly indicative of his discerning intellect and
indefatigable energy. A lawyer by profession, he scrapes up much time from his
practice to devote to his literary pursuits and research work In stead of enjoying
his well-earned rest in the vacations he tours extensively through several places of
historical importance, visits various Bhandars and establishes contact with a number
of people, all the while collecting facts and figures which finally take the shape of well-
documented history. What is really admirable about him is that he spends beyond
his means to achieve his end and satisfy his craving For days and nights he goes
on working at old manuscripts and taking down necessary extracts and excerpts from
them. He has done special researches regarding Jaina Literature which is found to
have been written in Gujarati and Rājasthānı and his results are substantiated in his
works, the number of the pages of which comes upto in octavo size 5900 pages
He obtained a manuscript of the present work from Sri Agarchandji Nahta of
Bikaner and finding its great historical value got the same copied for himself, as the
same was hitherto unknown and unpublished. Shriyut Nahata is also my learned
friend and enthusiastic diligent worker in the field of literature. He is a big banker
and a merchant who has many firms at Calcutta and other places in Bengal & Assam.
He has spent a lot after collecting thousands of old manuscripts and he has published
şeveral works at his own cost. He is taking keen interest in Singhi Jaina Series

and is showing hearty co-operation, by way of supplying the manuscripts from his
own collection and other Bhandars also The valuable material contained in the
present work and in the Kharatara gaccha gurvavali, Rathodavamsavalı, Karmacandra
prabandha, Vigraptılehhasamgraha etc which are being published in the Singhi Jaina
Series was mostly provided by him For all these things I express my sincere
thanks also to him at this place.
When Shri Desai showed this work to me, I expressed my desire looking
to its merit and importance to publish it in the Singhi Jaina Series. Shri Desai's
study of the subject treated in the Bhānucandra Caritra is deep and exhaustive.
He has published many articles which have a bearing on the subject and has done
much original research work and collected kindred materials Therefore I insisted
on him to undertake to edit it with an English summary and an elaborate intro-
duction incorporating historical facts etc relating to the work. Out of regard for
me he accepted my proposal whole-heartedly as a labour of love, the concrete result
of which is now in the hands of the readers.
This Bhānucandra Caritia is a remarkable composition of Sanskrit Literature
in which an able pupıl has chronicled, without the least exaggeration, acts of
social and religious service rendered by his great Guru It is an honest attempt
to give facts of pure history without using metaphorical language. The following
verse gives in a nutshell the stated idea -
न चाधिकं स्मयावेशादू न च न्यूनं तदत्ययात् । यथार्थमेव यजातं तत्तथैव निगद्यते ॥ १. १३.
'Neither have I exaggarated out of arrogance nor have I underestimated out of
meekness Whatever actually happened has been described here.'
Though the author styles the work as the Bhānucandra Caritra and says that he
mainly describes therein the life of his great Guru Upadhyaya Bhānucandra Gana,
he is also narrating in the later part the major portion of his own life so that wecan also
eall it a sort of an couto-brography of Siddhicandra Upadhyaya. Siddhicandra
relates in it as to how he got unparalleled education after becoming a yatı through
the grace of his Guru, how he become an object of Akbar's filial love, how he
stood by the side of his Guru as his co-worker in rendering social services, how he
enjoyed the favour of Jahangira and afterwards fell a victim to his displeasure and
finally how he passed through the ordeal for the sake of his vows and religion without
being scared away by exile, imprisionment or death He has given a short and a
nice account of all these important events concerning his own life. I know of no
other work of this type in Sanskrit Literature.
It is now a recognized truth that there are very few works of pure history in
our Sanskrit Literature. It is not at all a matter of overestimation if I say that
the present Bhānuchandra Caritra is a valuable addition to the existing literature

and should be ranked with Rājatarangini, Prthvirõjavijaya, Hammiramahāhāvya
Kumārapāla Caritra, Prabandhacintāmani and Vastupāla Caritrco
Of course there is no doubt that the Jaina literature is very rich in such
forms of literature. The number of works composed in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and Desi
is comparatively very great There are hundreds of Prabandhas, Prashastis, Caritras
and Rāsas of this type small or big These are, to name, Hirascubhāgyamahākāvya,
Vijayaprashastimahākāvya, Vijayadevamahātmya, Jagadgurukāvya, Digvijayamaha-
kāvya, Devānandābhyudayamahäkävya, Karmachandravamsaprabandha, Hirasūrırāsce
Vijayatılakasūrirāsce and many other available works of this type which can be called
contemporaneous with the Bhānuchandra caritra Though in all of these are
mostly reflected social and sectarian condition of the Jainas, many details of other
contemporary social and political conditions are also available which can help us
in completing many incomplete chapters of the history of our national life The
present Bhānucandra caritra besides giving many historical facts concerning the
Tainas, also gives some novel historical data and details of general interest Historians
have dealt at length the meritorious deeds of Akbar the great and Abul Fazl his
talented minister. It is not known to me that any Hindu writer other than that of
the Bhānucandra caritra has given in so brief but so fully significant words the
description of incomparable merits and extraordinary ability of these two great men.
Akbar the great was not only a great conqueror and the ablest ruler but
he was also a great lover of arts and sciences and a man of Napoleanıc will-power
and gigantic strength Siddhicandra had had the luck of enjoying his confidence
and love so much so that he was to him more than a son The following single
stanza gives the whole idea of Akbar's abovementioned merits -
न सा कला न तद् ज्ञानं न तद् धैर्यं न तद् बलम् । शाहिना युवराजेन यत्र नैवोद्यमः कृतः ॥ १. ५६.
"There is not a single art, not a single branch of knowledge, not a single act of
boldness and strength which was not attempted by the young Emperor.'
Many Muslim writers of Akbar's time have written much about the extra-
ordinary genius of Abul Fazl This is also manifest from his own books entitled
the "Akbarnāmā” and “Ain-2-Akbarı" A reference to his intellectual exuberance
and matchless precocity from the pen of Siddhicandra, who was a disinterested
ascetic and who had the opportunity of passing many years in his close company, is
pregnant with meaning. The following stanza used by Siddhicandra to describe
his gifts engenders love and respect for him in our heart -
निःशेषवाङ्मयांभोधेः पारदृश्वा विदां वरः। १.६७.
नास्ति तद्वाङ्मये तेन न दृष्टं यच्च न श्रुतम् ॥ १. ७१.
"He had gone through the ocean of the whole literature and he was the best amongst
all learned men' "There is nothing in the whole literature which was neither seen
nor heard by him.'

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
Siddhicandra also further informs us that Abul Fazl had learnt the six
systems of philosophy and matters connected with them from Bhanucandra-his
Guru-at whose feet he sat for many days and took down notes. Thus the ties of
friendship between them were cemented.
In Hirasaubhagya Kavya and other books we come across a detailed sketch
of Hira vijay asuri's meeting with Al-bar and it gets additional support from this
Bhānucandra Caritra also But a connected and a continuous link as to how the
influence of the brilliant pupils of the great Suri evolved in the Moghul Darbar
as a result of their meeting is only to be found in this caritra. We know from this
book how much the spotless character and a forceful individuality of Bhanucandra
had deeply and respectfully impressed the great Moghul, who always kept him in his
company and every Sunday in the morning heard him with rapt attention and devo-
tional fervour when he was reciting Sūryasahasranāma. Akbar's grandchildren also
had been tutored in certain branches by him After his excursion to Kashmere when
he returned to Lahore, and he was once witnessing an antelope-fight, he was wounded
by a deer which injured him with a horn whereupon he fell to swoon. He remained
bedridden for fifty days and the whole empire had plunged in sorrow. At that time
only two were principal amongst those most confidential persons who were allowed
to go to him One of them was Shaikh Abul Fazland the other, Bhanu candra.
This gives us a fair idea about the extraordinariness of Bhanu candra who was no
doubt a captivating figure This is a glaring example of the inescapable charm and en-
ormous dignity of a Hindu-Jaina-Yati which established hold on the mind of a shrewd
and fastidious ruler lıke Akbar from whom he extracted Fırmans granting benefits to
and ensuring the good of his community. This is, of course, a matter of great pride
for the Tainas But what I want to emphasise in particular is this that he not only
brought his influence to bear on Akbar for doing the good of his community only,
but of public at large also. To illustrate this point I am citing two incidents from
the book. Once Khan Ajij Koka the Suba of Gujarat led an invasion on Jam
Satrasala the King of Jamnagar who was eventually taken captive with all his
men Akbar celebrated the occasion of this victory by granting various gifts to his
dear and near. And he requested Bhanucandra also to ask for something. In
stead of wishing for any trifling thing, he skilfully demanded release of all those pri.
soners which the Emperor had to grant soon (2, 114ff) The other matter of public
welfare was getting the cessation of the levying of Jajiyātax. Siddhicandra writes
to this effect that when Prince Salım was appointed the Suba of Gujarat he sent
his officers there who used to harass much the people of Gujarat The Jajiyā and
the other taxes which were stopped by Akbar were revived, Letters informing about
this oppression were received by Bhanucandra who sent Siddhicandra to put
Salim in the right knowledge of affairs hearing which Salim became sad at heart
and issued firmans to his officers, repealing the taxes. The statement should be
taken fully reliable in view of the fact that it is Siddhicandra himself who
makes it.

PREFACE BY THE GENRAL EDITOR
After the death of Akbar, Salım became a King. Like his father he also had
cultivated a feeling of respect for Bhanucandra In the close company of
Akbar and Jahangir, Bhanucandra thus passed a long period covering
twenty three years after which both Bhanucandra and Siddhicandra came
to their native country-Gujarat with the permission of Emperor Jahangir
They spent there four-five years passing rainy seasons at different places viz.
Ahmedabad, Baroda, Gandhara, and Patan etc Thereafter they both
returned again to Agra in accordance with a request of the Emperor As Bhanu-
candra was growing old, Jahangir took a fancy for Siddhicandra who was
also equally endowed His uncommon handsomeness and a well-built physique
had produced deep affection in the heart of Akbar who treated him as his son.
Akbar had inspired him to undertake serious studies and it was due to his encourage.
ment that he made thorough study of Persian also Some of his studies were cariied
on in the company of royal grandchildren Thus he was sufficiently familiar with
Jahangir for a long time. He was well versed in the art of concentrating his
attention on many topics at one and the same time and had complete mastery on
the poetics and other secular sciences. In Jahangir's court and in private parties
he cut a brilliant figure in reparties This association with Jahangir took the form
of a fast friendship. This led the Emperor once to press him to give up asceticism
and accept a good post at his court But Siddhicandra skilfully evaded all
his tempting offers and clang to monkhood with firmness. Begum Noormahal
alias Noorja han also took part in the discussions dissuading him from monkhood
which, under no circumstances, Siddhicandra was willing to do This made
the easily excitable King angry and consequently ordered him to leave the court
and to resort to a jungle for disrespecting his wishes Siddhicandra gladly
accepted it without any fear and took shelter in a village called Mālpur respecting
the request of the reigning Thakore Bhanu candra used to come to the court
as usual and the King also honoured him suitably But it was clear to the cunning
eyes of the King that sadness had settled on the face of Bhanu candra He
knew from his talks with Bhanu candra that the reason was the injustice meted out
to Siddhicandra The feeling of friendship rose in his heart, he became
repentant and corrected his misdemeanour by recalling Siddhicandra who
immediatey responded to his invitation and came to Agra The Emperor respect.
fully granted an interview at a proper time and asked for apology for his ruthless
treatment which was given generously. Siddhicandra humbly and affection-
ately gave an adequate reply They became delighted and the lost relation was
reyiyed with former force and Siddhicandra thus became entitled Jahangir
passand ( favourite of Jahangir) Here ends the Bhānuchandra Caritra
All these facts make it quite clear as to how much influence Bhanu candra
had on the mind of Jahangir also and how courageous and daring his pupil Sıddı.
candra was who courted disaster caring a bit for the displeasure and threats of an
Emperor like Jahangir. This is an event glorious in the history of medieval Jainism
of which every Jaina can well be proud.

BHĀNUCANDRA CHARITRA
This caritra provides us with a short but sound historical narrative as to how
two great Moghul emperors were made favourable to Jainism by the most able and
dignified Jaina Yatis
This Bhānuchandra Caritic provides us with a brief but true account as
to what noble deeds were performed for the protection and welfare of their country
and religion by the Jaina Yatis attracting with their marvellous force of character and
wide range of knowledge the mercurial minds of the world's unsurpassed Emperors
lıke Akbar and Jahangir who were entirely adverse to their culture and religion.
To prove the historicity of every fact arising out of the account given in this
Bhānucandra Caritra, Shri Desai has cited in his long introduction sufficient evidence
and proofs from other reliable sources in an able and systematic manner
With the hope that it will receive the response it so well deserves I place this
book before the public.

INTRODUCTION.
I. JAINA PRIESTS AT THE COURT OF AKBAR.
Of all the emperors that wielded their sway over India, Asoka and Akbar deserve
our deepest respect and special notice for the catholicity of their attitude towards
religions, other than their own. An extract from one of Asoka's numerous edicts is
given below with a view to enable the reader to gauge the breadth of vision and the
spirit of religious toleration that animated its author -
"That creeds differ from one another in certain basic principles is quite true.
But this is all the more reason why the adherents of a faith should, while, of course,
remaining faithful to their own creed, treat other faiths dispassionately and try to learn
from them things which, they think, are lacking in their own faith Setting high a faith
simply because one happens to be its follower, and crying down all otheis simply because
others follow them, would most certainly do more harm than good to one's one faith.
Dogged adherence and dogmatic ways of thinking are the cankers that eat away
the spiritual body of a religion and reduce it to a clod of earth One may, by all means,
loyally put into practice the tenets of one's faith, but, at the same time, he may, to his
own advantage and to that of his faith, respect and treat with toleration and sympathy,
the tenets of other faiths One should treat other faiths exactly as one wishes others to
treat one's own faith. The common ideal of all religions is the spiritual upliftment and
peace of human beings. What harm is there if there are divers ways of reaching
the same ideal ?"
A muslim by birth, Akbar's mind was broad enough not to look upon Islām as
the only religion that would dispel all the darkness obstructing the spiritual progress
of mankind. He wanted to find out a common ground on which all faiths would
agree. It was one of his ambitions to found a faith acceptable to all human beings.
Once he said –

Page 21****************************************************************************************
BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
“Although I am the master of so vast a kingdom and all the appliances of
Government are to my hand, yet since true greatness consists in doing the will of God,
my mind is not at ease in this diversity of sects and creeds, and a part from this outward
pomp of circumstance, with what satisfaction in my des pondency, can I undertake
the sway of empire? I await the coming of some discreet man of principle, who
will resolve the difficulties of my conscience”. ("The Sayings of His Majesty” Aine
Akbarı Vol. III P 386)
Maxmuller calls Akbar the first student of comparative religion. Fired with
the zeal to provide a common faith for all, he first studied and discussed the doctrines of
Islān with the help of Ulemās. Next, he gathered around him a select group of persons,
who had drunk deep at the fountains of other faiths-Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism.
Christianity and other faiths ? Reason rather than anything else was his guiding star in
his quest of truth, which would be acceptable to all He once said, "(1) The superiority
of man rests on the jewel of reason. It is meet that he should labour in its burnishing,
and turn not from its instruction, (2) A man is the disciple of his own reason. If it has
naturally a good lustre, it becomes itself his director, and if it gains it under the direction
of a higher mind, it is still a guide” (Aine Akbarı Vol. III p. 382)
The result of his inquiry into, and study of, the tenets of various faiths was little
short of a revelation to him. He found that the common principle running through
all the faiths was the quest of truth-eternal truth about the purpose lying behind
the creation, in the broadest sense of the term. He also found that all the faiths were
nothing but strenuous efforts to mould human behaviour in such a way that it would be
in tune with the infinite, and that all the faiths represented the undying desire of Man to
see his way through the tangled cobweb of this universe. Some faiths had gone far on
the way to this final discovery, while others lagged behind; but all unflinchingly aimed
at the same thing. No sooner did this truth dawn upon him, than he proclaimed complete
religious toleration throughout the length and breadth of his mighty empire. It was the
corner stone on which he strove to build the edifice of a World Faith. He earnestly
believed that it would make the world happy and contented, and would bring lasting
peace to one and all. At least, this belief made him the mightiest and the most
beloved monarch.
The days of Islamic superiority and despotic fanaticism were over He frankly
admits - Formerly, I persecuted men in conformity with my faith, and deemed it Islām.
As I grew in knowledge, I was overwhelmed with shame. Not being a Muslim myself,
it was not meet to force others to become such What constancy is to be expected from
proselytes on compulsion 2" (Aine Akbarı Vol III. p. 384).
Early in 1573 A.D the Ibādatkhānā or“The House of Worship” was built Religious
1 Abul Fazal says — With the magnanimity which distinguishes him and with his wonted
zeal, he continues his search for superior men, and finds & reward in the care with which he
selects such as are fit for his society" (Aine Akbarı Vol. I, P 154 Ain. 72 The manner in
which His Majesty spends bis time)

Page 22****************************************************************************************
INTRODUCTION
debates and discussions were carried on there about three years by the Ulemās of rival
schools of Islāmic theology. Abul Fazl says that by 1578 A D, representatives of many
creeds had gathered there to join the discussions "Sufi philosopher, orator, jurist, Sunni,
Shia, Brāhman, Jatı, Sıurā, Chārvāk, Nazarene, Jew, Satr (Satran), Zoroastrian and
others enjoyed exquisite pleasure." (Akbarnāmā Vol III, p 365 Beveridge's edition).
The term “Jatı” (Sanskrit equivalent “Yatı') in the above extract, refers to Jaina
(not Buddhist) ascetics or monks, and the term "Seurā” (Sanskrit “Svetāmbara”, Prakrit
“Seyamvara") means “Svetāmbara Jainas" 2 Chalmers, however, mistranslated them as
“Jains, Buddhists”. Elliot and Dowson (authors of “History of India as told by its own
Historians”) took Chalmer's interpretation as correct This, in its turn, led Von Noer,
(author of "The Emperor Akbar”) to infer wrongly -“It may be concluded with not too
slight probability that there were Buddhists at Fattepur” (Beveridge's translation I, 327,
note) The fact, on the other hand, is that there is not a tittle of evidence to the effect
that any Buddhist ever attended these religious debates or that Akbar ever came in touch
with a Buddhist scholar Abul Fazl, as he himself admits, failed to learn anything about
Buddhism because Buddhism was almost extinct in India in those times.
Badaoni, a staunch Muslim historian, while summarising the reasons, which led
Akbar to renounce the Islām says _“The Principal reason was the large number of
learned men of all denominations and sects, that came to his Court from varions countries,
were granted private audiences. His Majesty heard the opinion of each one, espe-
cially of non-Muslims, retaining that which appealed to his reason and rejecting every-
thing else As a result of this, a faith based on some elementary principles traced itself
on the mirror of his heart, and out of the various influences that were brought to
bear on His Majesty, there grew gradually as an outline on a stone, the conviction in
his heart, that there were sensible men in all religions, and abstemious thinkers and men
endowed with miraculous powers, among all nations”
He further states -- Moreover Sumarnis(S'ramanas --Jaina ascetics) and Brāhmans
2 Abdul Fazal has referred to S'vetāmbaras as Sewra while taking brief notices of nine
schools --Nyāya, Vaisesika, Mimānsā, Vedānta, Sankhya, Pātanjala (Yoga), Jaina, Bauddha,
Nāstika (Chārvāka )-see pp 172 to 218 Aine Akbarı Vol III wherein Jaina School
is treated at pp 188 to 210 At the end of that notice he says — The writer has met
with no one who had personal knowledge of both (Svetāmbara and Digambara) orders and
his account of the Digambaras has been written as it were in the dark, but having some
acquaintance with the learned of the Svetāmbara order, who are also known as S'ewrā,
he has been able to supply a tolerably full notice'
3 Mr. W H Lowe, M A has also translated Al Badaoni In Vol II p 264, the translation
of the above-quoted extract is given It begins “And Samanas and Brahmins" etc.
Mr Love in the foot-note, says that the term "Samanas” means "Buddhist monks".
We have, however, already shown that no Buddhist monk ever visited the Court of Akbar.
Blochman, writing about the same word, says in a foot-note, “Explained in Arab dictionaries
as a sect in Sind, who believed in the transmigration of souls (Tanāsuhh), Akbar, as will be
seen from the following, was convinced of the doctrine of the transmigration of souls,
and therefore rejected the doctrine of resurrection " We know that this interpretation of the
term is not quite correct "Samanzs” and “Samanas” are the corrupt Prakrit forms of

managed to get frequent private audiences with His Majesty. They surpass other learned
men in their treatises on morals and on physical and religious sciences, they have reached
a high degree of perfection in their knowledge of the future, in spiritual power and human
perfection. Consequently, they laid down proofs, based on reason and testimony,
of the truth of their own religion, and of the fallacies of others; and they inculcated their
doctrines so firmly, and so skilfully represented things as quite self-evident-things which
otherwise require consideration-that to raise a doubt in His Majesty's mind about
the truth of their doctrines was more difficult than crumbling a mountain to dust or
tearing asunder the heavens above" (Blochman Al Badaoni p. 256)
"Hence His Majesty cast aside the Islamic revelations regarding resurrection,
the day of judgment, and all the details connected with it, as also all ordinances based on
the tradition of our Prophet. The doctrine of the transmigration of the souls especially
took a deep root in his heart, and he approved of the saying - There is no religion in
which the doctrine of transmigration has not taken firm root'
It is now definitely proved that the terms "Jatı” and “Sewrās” used by
Abul Fazl, and the term "Samanis” in Badaoni's work, refer to the monks and members
of the Jaina Svetāmbara sect. The Jaina monks, thus played a prominent part in
the discussions and debates at the Ibādatkhānā, and had a powerful hold over the mind of
the emperor. Modern European historians took little notice of this-may be quite
unintentionally. It was the late great Jaina scholar, Chimanlal Dahyabhai Dalal,
M. A., who drew their attention to this, by writing, under the nom de plume "C.”
an article on "Hīravijaya Sūrı or the Jainas at the Court of Akbar," which was published
in Jaina S'āsana, Divālı Issue (Benares ), of S. Y. 1910, Vira Sam. 2437 (pp 113 to 128).
This article constituted the principal authority for Dr. Vincent Smith when he wrote on
the influence of Jains on Akbar, in his authoritative work, "Akbar, the Great Mogul”.
(Later editions). His article, “The Jain Teachers of Akbar" (Bhandārkar's Commemo-
ration Vol. pp. 265 to 276), is also largely based upon the same.
Mr Dalal says “ It is true that the religious side of Akbar's character has
received disproportionate amount of attention, nevertheless, it is very interesting to see
how that mighty figure achieved a quite herculean task of not only satisfying his subjects
professing various creeds and religions, but making them believe that he was a follower of
their faith. The Christians believed that he was a Christian, the Parsis that he was
a Parsi, while the Hindoos thought that he was a Hindoo His religious policy thus
excites our great admiration"
“ Akbar's religion was an eclectic one, as he was an earnest seeker after truth,
he took it from wherever (whatever source ) he found it. In the following pages it is
shown what he took from Jainism-non-killing of beings (non-violence), compassion
the Sanskrit term "S'ramana" Now, the term "S'ramana" is applicable to Jaina, as well as
to Buddhist monks, but as no Buddhist monk over visited the Court of Akbar, Badaoni
must have therefore used the terms to mean Jaina monks only.

towards all living beings, abstaining to a certain extent from flesh-eating, belief ir.
re-incarnation and in the theory of Karma, and how he favoured it by (his) handing over
its religious places to its followers and honouring its learned professors”.
A marvellous array of conquests over almost all parts of India was one of the many
glorious achievements of Akbar His plan of biinging under his sceptre the whole of
India had met with a large measure of success By the end of the 18th year of his rule,
in 1574 A, D, his sway extended over North-Western, Central and Western India
(Gujarāt conquered in 1573 A D ), and over the Punjāb and Kābul The end of
1574 A D witnessed the annexation of Bengal and Behār, and in 1575 A D, his mighty
hand descended over Orissā. According to Badāoni, “many years previous to 983 H. E
(1576 A. D), the emperor had gained in succession remarkable and decisive battles
No opponent was left in the world”. It was about this time that the Emperor got
the Ibādatkhānā built at Fatehpur Men of learning, men well versed in the doctrines of
their own faiths, religious fanatics and liberal-minded philosophers, in short, men interested
in religious problems, gathered there in large numbers, and carried on discussions
and debates over which the Emperor, not unoften, presided. Thereafter he suppressed
several rebellions here and there (Malleson, “The Emperor Akbar” p 115 and onwards).
Abul Fazl says in his Aine Akbarı (Vol. 1, p 537) _“I shall now speak of the
sages of the period and classify them according to their knowledge, casting aside
all differences of ci eed. His Majesty, who is himself the leader of the material and
the ideal worlds and the sovereign over the external and the internal, honours five classes
of sages as worthy of attention .. The first class, in the lustie of their star, perceive the
mysteries of the external and the internal, and in their understanding and the breadth of
their views, fully comprehend both realms of thought The second class pay less attention
to the external world, but in the light of their hearts they acquie vast knowledge,
(1. e. they understand the mysteries of the heart) The third class do not step beyond
the arena of observation and possess a certain knowledge of what rests on testimony
(Philosophers and theologians). The fourth class look upon testimony as something filled
with the dust of suspicion, and handle nothing without proof (Philosophers). The fifth
class are bigoted, and cannot pass beyond the narrow sphere of revealed testimony.
In the list of these learned men, we come acıoss the names of three Jainas, viz.,
Hariji Sūr, Bijai Sen Sūr, and Bhānchand, they are no others than Hīra-Vijaya Sūrı,
Vijaya-Sena Sūrı, and Bhānucandra Upādhyāya. Hīra-Vijaya Sūri is placed in the first
class, while Vijaya-Sena Sūrı and Bhānucandia -- with whom we are concerned here, are
placed in the fifth class
1. Hīra Vijaya Sūri
After bis return from Kābul in 1582 A D Akbar heard that there was in Gujarāt
a Jaina Monk, named Hīra-Vijaya Sūri, who was richly endowed with strıking qualities
of head and heart and who led a life of saintly purity. Always eager to come into

contact with such learned and holy persons, he sent two Mewrāsé to Ahmedabad,
with a firmān, ordering Sāhebkhān", the governor of Gujarātº, to ask the monk to proceed
towards his Court Sāhibkhān informed the leading Jainas of Ahmedābād of this imperial
invitation. A deputation of Jainas waited upon the Ācārya at Gandhār. He readily
accepted the invitation thinking that much good might come out of his visit to the
emperor In a short time he reached Ahmedābād where he was received by Sāhibkhān
who offered him money, conveyances, horses and other means of comfort. He politely
thanked him for his offer, but at the same time refused to accept them on the ground that
Jama monks were prohibited from accepting any such means of physical comfort, by their
religious tenets From Ahmedābād, he started on foot towards Āgrā, visiting village
after village, and town after town on his way, preaching the gospel of Lord Mahāvīra
to the people. On his reaching Agrā, he was accorded a royal reception.
It was Abul Fazl who escorted the Ācārya to his palace. A discussion took place
between the two, specially on the questions of resurrection and redemption. Hīra Vijaya
Sūri made it crystal clear to Abul Fazl that a man's happiness or misery in his present
life was the result of his actions meritorious or wicked done previously during his
present or former life or lives. This struck at the root of the idea of all human beings
rising from their graves on the Day of Judgment to hear the Divine Decrees from the
Almighty, who would administer to them even-handed justice according to the way
they led their lives The idea of a personal God thus was a superfluity Abul Fazl
was mightily impressed with his lucid way of explaining things, and at once took him
to the Emperor, who, hearing that the holy man had come all the way on foot in con-
formity with the rules of his Order, greeted him with much pleasure and respect. In the
talk that ensued, the Acārya explained to the emperor what he had already explained to
Abul Fazl, about the nature of Supreme Deity, that of a true preceptoi-master and true
religion. He also laid great stress upon the imperativeness of leading a pure and holy

life devoted unflinchingly to the good of all beings. Then he dwelt upon the five gieat
vows observed by all Jaina monks, viz non violence, truth, non-acceptance of anything
without its being offered, celibacy and non-possession. Then Akbar requested him to
read his future from the position of the stars, but the sage replied that he could not
comply with that request because Jaina monks, were forbidden by their religion to read
any one's future or to make prediction.
The impression that the Ācārya made on the emperor was profound, and as a token
of his admiation for him he offered him a large number of religous books, an offer which
the monk at first was disinclined to accept but which he accepted when pressed by
the importunities of Abul Fazl and Thānsing A library was opened at Āgrā and
all these books were placed there under the charge of Thānsing.
After the monsoon of 1582 A. D the Emperor had another audience with
the Acārya at Abul Fazl’s palace This time he offered him a large sum of money,
horses, elephants and other things, but the sage politely refused the offer saying that
a Jaina monk was never to accept any such thing pertaining to material comfort from any
one When pressed by the emperoi to ask for something for him and thus to afford him
an opportunity of being useful to him in some way, the sage requested him to release all
the prisoners, to set free all the caged birds, and to prohibit the slaughter of animals at
least during the eight days of Jaina holidays known as Paryusana. The Emperor
readily complied with this request of the sage and instantly issued orders prohibiting
animal slaughter for not only 8 but 12 days. This order was later on extended to the
Naoroz day. Fishing was prohibited at the lake Dāmara", a large lake stretching over
12 Yanas near Fatehpūr Sīkrī. The Emperor took a vow to refrain thenceforward
from hunting', a favourite pastime of his.
In June 1584 A, D. (S. Y 1641 first Asādha) the title Jagadguru (World
Precepter) was conferred upon the Ācārya. In celebration of this auspicious occasion,
bırds encaged on the banks of Dāmara were set free. In conformity with the wishes of
7 le from the 10th of the dark half of Śrāvana to the 6th of the bright half of Bhādrapada
(while 8 days of Paryusana begin from the 12th of Śravana Vadı and end on the 4th of
Bhadrapada Sudi with Śvetāmbara Jainas).

9 As to hunting Akbar said "Although hunting suggests analogies of State Policy, nevertheless
the first consideration is to be sparing in the destruction of life ” (Aine Akbarı 111 p 399,
The Sayings of Akbar) Sometimes he indulged in hunting for the reasons of State.
- He always makes hunting a means of increasing his knowledge, and besides, uses hunting
parties as occasions to inquire, without having first given notice of his coming, into the
condition of the people and the army He travels incognito and examines into matterr

He lifts up such as are oppressed, and punishes the oppressors. On account of these highes

the emperor, the title “Upādhyāya” was conferred upon śānticandra The Sūri passed
the monsoons of 1584, 1585 and 1586 A D. at Āgrā, Abhırāmābād (Ibrāhimābād-then
about 12 miles from Fatehpūr Sikrī and not Allāhābād as wrongly supposed by some)
and Āgrā respectively Then he left Āgrā for Gujarāt, leaving śānticandra at the
Court (The details given above are extracted from Hira-Saubhāgya-Mahā-Kāvya.
Readers desirous of having a full account should consult that work, Jagadguru
Kāvya and Krpā-Rasa-Kosa all in Sanskrit; other sources of information are
Hiravijaya Rāsa (in Gujarātı) by Rsabhadāsa, and the inscriptions in Sanskrit at
Satrunjaya, especially the long record (No. XII Epi. Indica Vol II Ch 6, J. BR S.
August 1844, No 12 Jinavijaya II) containing 67 verses composed by Hemavijaya
and inscribed in A D 1593 at the Adınātha templea'), and at Vairāt (Bairāt) in
Jaipur State inscribed in Saka 1509-A D 1587 (No 379 Jīnavijaya II).
2. S'ānticandra Upādhyāya.
Sānticandra is the author of a panegyric on the Emperor. The work is composed
in Sanskrit, and is entitled Krpā-rasa-Kosa (Treasury of the merciful deeds of
the Emperor). He used to recite these verses in the presence of the Emperor, who
always held a high opinion about him. When Sānticandra started for Gujarāt in 1587
A D., the Emperor issued firmāns prohibiting the slaughter of animals, and proclaiming
the abolition of the Jazıā tax (a tax levied on Hindus). For six months out of the year,
animal-slaughter was prohibited. These six months consisted of the previous 12 days
which included 8 days of Paryusana, the Naoroz day, all Sundays, days of Sophian, Id,
equinoxes, the month of his birth, days of Mihira, the month of Rajab, and the birth-days
of his sons."
In support of this, we find in Al-Badaoni, p. 321 ( Blochman) —“In these days
(991 H E. - 1583 A D and thereafter) new orders were given. The kıllıng of animals
on certain days was forbidden, as on Sundays, because this day is sacred to the Sun;
during the first eighteen days of the month Farwardin, the whole month of Aban
(the month in which His Majesty was born) and on several other days, to please
the Hindus This order was extended over the whole realm, and capital punishment was
inflicted on every one who acted against the command. Many a family was ruined.”
(and his property confiscated. Lowe)
The term “Hindu” in the extract above means “Jainas", because Jainas only
made endeavours to preach and practise the prevention of animal-slaughter
10 In one of the inscriptions (No 118 Epi Indica Vol II Ch 6) Buhler misread 71% for FTET
and then stated that Hiravijaya belonged to the Sāfa race This wrong statement was quoted
by V Smith in his article, “The Jain Teachers of Akbar” Bhand Com Vol p 273.
This mistake should, however, be corrected Hiravijaya Sūri was an Osvāl Banıā before
he became a Jaina Sädhu

श्रीमत् पर्युपणादिना रविमिता सवे रवेमिरा मोफीयानदिना अपीददिवसा सक्रान्तिघस्रा पुन ।

INTRODUCTION,
Akhai fasted during these days Abul Fazl says -" During the time of these fasts,
His Majesty abstained altogether from meat, as religious penance, gradually extending the
several fasts during a year over six months and even more, with a view to eventually
discontinuing the use of meat altogether”. (Aine Akbarı Vol. I, p. 200)
Mr. Vincent Smith, in his “Akbar” p 167, says --Akbar's action in abstaining
almost wholly from eating meat and in issuing stringent prohibitions resembling those of
Asoka, restricting to the narrowest possible limits the destruction of animal life, certainly
was taken in obedience to the doctrine of his Jain teachers”
śānticandra went to Gujarāt, leaving Bhānucandra in his place
3. Bhānucandra.
Bhānucandra and his pupil Siddhicandra continued to stay at Court during
the remaining part of Akbar's life and during the rule of Jahāngir also Bhānucandra
had accompanied Akbar to Kāśmır. While the Emperor was strolling on the banks of
the lake named Jayanal Lankā, he requested him to abolish the tax which was then levied
on Jaina pilgrims to Mount Satrunjaya. The Emperor graciously complied with his
request. An imperial firmān was issued making grant of the Hill to Hira-Vijaya Sūri,
and it was despatched to him in 1592 A. D. A detailed account of Bhānucandra will be
given later on when we come to the contents of the present work which is nothing
but his biography.
4. Sıddhicandra
He was a favourite and talented pupil of Bhānucandra. A handsome youth and
a great scholar of Sanskrit and Persian, he made a profound impression upon Akbar.
He performed 108 avadhānas (i e attending to 108 things at a time), a marvellous feat
of memory The Emperor, much pleased and highly impressed with this, conferred upon
him the title “Khush-fahan" (a man of sharp intellect) He is the author of the
present work. More details about him will be given later on.
5. Vijaya-Sena Sūri.
During the monsoon of 1592 A. D. (S. Y 1649 Hindi) Hira-Vijaya Sûri was
residing at Rādhanpur It was there that he received the imperial firmān making him
the grant of Mount Satrunjaya He also received an imperial call from Lāhore, to send
his pupil Vijaya-Sena Sūri there as Akbar wanted to meet him. In response to the call,
he directed his pupil to start for Lāhore and to pay à visit to the Emperor there,
After the monsoon was over, Vijaya-Sena on Mārgaśīrşa S'ukla 3rd S. Y. 1649 ( Monday
27th November 1592 A.D.) started for Lāhore and reached it on the 12th day of the
bright half of Jyestha S Y 1650, (Thursday 31st May 1593 A.D.). One of his pupils,
Nandivijaya by name, performed eight avadhānas-attending to eight things at a time.
The emperor, favourably impressed with the performance, conferred upon him the title
" Khush-faham” (a man of sharp intellect).

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
Some non-Jainas told Akbar that the Jainas did not believe in God Upon this,
the Emperor requested Vijaya-Sena Sūri to hold a debate at his Court with the learned
brāhmins, on the subject of the existence or otherwise of God. The debate was duly
conducted, and Vijayasena, quoting chapter and verse from the scriptures, marshalling
facts and arguments based upon sound logic, gave a lucıd exposition of the Jaina view
of God, and convinced and silenced the Brāhmins once for all. On another occasion
the Sūri convinced the Emperor of the necessity of prohibition of the slaughter of cows.
bulls, she-buffaloes and he-buffaloes, and of repealing the unedifying law which empowered
the State to confiscate the property of those persons who died heir-less, and of capturing
prisoners as hostages Convinced of the harmful nature of these things, the Emperor
issued firmāns prohibiting all these things
At the instance of the Emperor, the Sûri conferred the title “ Upādhyāya” upon
Bhānucandra. On this occasion, Abul Fazl gave 600 Rupees and 108 horses in charity.
Pleased with Sūri's ability to score success over Brāhmins in the debates at the Court, the
Emperor conferred on him the title . Savār Hiravyjaya Sūri' (1. e. in a way superior to even
his master Hira-Vijaya Sūrı) He spent two monsoons at Lāhore. When he departed
for Gujarāt, imperial firmāns about the prohibition of animal-slaughter, confiscation of
property, and the capture of prisoners as stated above were presented to him. He started
for Gujarāt in 1596 A D By the end of that year, Hira-Vijaya Sūri died at Unā in
Kāthiāwar. [A detailed account of Vijaya Sena Sūri will be found in -Vaaya-prasasti
Kāvya a work on Sanskrit which is virtually his biography, 6th Chapter of Vijayadevam
Sürz-Māhātmyam, inscriptions of S. Y 1656 (No. 454 Jinavijaya II ), S. Y. 1659
and 1661 (Nos. 913 and 1121 Buddhi. II), S. Y. 1662 and 1664 (Nos. 511 and 512,
Jina. II), S. Y 1666 (No. 406 Buddhı II) 1
All the five Jaina teachers mentioned above belonged to Jaina Svetāmbara
Tapā Gaccha and hailed from Gujarāt. For them the readers are referred to C's article
* Hiravijaya Sūrı or the Jainas at the Court of Akbar' and V. Smith's article "Jain
Teachers of Akbar' and his book “Akbar the Great Mogul'. One prominent Jaina
teacher with whom Akbar came into contact, was a member of the Jaina Svetāmbara.
Kharatara Gaccha His name was Jinacandra Sūri. European scholars do not seem
to have taken any notice of him. That is all the more reason why we shall dwell upon
him along with his pupil Mānasınha at some length below.
6-7. Jina-candra Sūri and Jina-simha Sūri.
In 1591 A, D, Akbar was at Lāhore. There he heard that Jinacandra Sūri was
also a great Jaina teacher. So he called Mantri Karmacandra, a lay member of the
Kharatara Gaccha, and asked him everything about the preceptor. An imperial firman
was given to him inviting the holy man to the Court. The Sūrı received the firman
at Cambay. He immediately started. At Jālor, he passed the monsoon In Māgsar of
S. Y. 1648, (November 1591 A. D) he started for Lāhore and reached it on the
12th day of the bright half of Fāgan of S. Y. 1648. (Monday 14th February
1592 A, D.) It was "Id' day of the year. Karmacandra escorted him to the Court.

Page 30****************************************************************************************
INTRODUCTION.
The Emperor had a private audience with him, in which he expressed his delight
at the promptness with which the Súrı had responded to his invitation He requested
him to be present at his Court whenever religious debates and discussions were
held. He further said that all his desires were fulfilled and he wanted the Sūri's
blessings to the effect that his heart might always remain filled with compassion and that
his son also might be of an equally compassionate nature At his request the Sūri passed
the monsoon at Lāhore. Seeing that the Emperor respected him highly, the people called
him “Bade Guru” (Great teacher) One day the Sūrı heard that the temples neai
Dwārkā were demolished by Navarang Khān. He thereupon requested the Emperor
to protect all the Jaina temples. Akbar is alleged to have issued a firmān proclaiming
the Grant of Satrunjaya and other Jaina holy places to Karmacandra Mantri A firman
to the same effect, bearing the imperial seal, was sent to Ājam Khān i, e Khân-1-Azam
alias Mirza Ajiz Kokāh (Ilāhi 36 1. e 1592 A D. S. Y. 1649 Hındı).
Before starting on his expedition to Kāśmır, the Emperor called the Ācārya and
had his “dharmalābha” (religious blessings ). At that time he issued a firman
prohibiting slaughter of animals for further 7 days from Āsādha Sukla 9th to 15th. It
was despatched to all bis 11 Subahs (Governors) At the request of Akbar, Mānasimha,
a favourite disciple of Acārya, with Dungara (Harsaviśāla) and others of his pupils
accompanied him to Kāśmir, so that he might have religious talks whenever he so desired
It was at the instance of Mānasımha, that Akbar prohibited fishing in all the lakes of
Kāśmır. After the death of the ruler of Kāśmir, it was resubjugated. Akbar returned
to Lāhore ( 29th December 1592 A D., S. Y. 1649 Pauşa Sudı 6th Friday)
Akbar then conferred the title “ Yuga-Pradhāna” (Supreme in the Age)
on Jinacandra Sūrı, and the title “ Acārya" on Mānasimha, whose name was changed to
Jinasımha Sūri. The occasion was celebrated with great eclat on Fāgan S'ud 2,
S. Y. 1649, ( Friday 23rd February 1593 A D) by Karmacandra, who was encouraged
and supported by the Emperor himself. Fishing and animal-slaughter were prohibited
in Cambay for one year, and in Lāhore animal-slaughter was prohibited on the
day of the festival. (From Karmacandra Vamsa Prabandha a Sanskrit poem
composed by Jayasoma Upādhyāya at Lāhore in S. Y. 1650, Vijaya-daśamı (Tuesday
12 Navrangkhān--was a son of Kutbuddin Muhammad Khăn When Akbar left Ahmedābād in
charge of Khān-i-Āzam, Navrang Khān was commissioned to go forward to Khambhāyat
against Muhammed Hussein Mirza who rebelled and had gone there from Deccan and
ultimately was defeated His father was in possession of Broach fort (Al Badãoni pp 167,
173 and 341) In 1591-92 A. D news was received that Muzaffar (of Gujarāt) had taken
refuge at Jagat (north latitude 22° 15 last longitude 69' 1'-the site of the temple of Dwarka,
at the western extremity of the peninsula of Kathiawar). The Viceroy (of Ahmedabad
Mirzā Aziz Kokaltāsh 1588 to 1592 A. D.) at once sent Navrang Khān and others
(other commanders Mirāt-i-Ahmadı) with an army in pursuit On reaching Jagat (these
commanders took the place and established a mosque. Mırāt-1-Ahmadı-History of Gujarāt
by Bird p. 420-421) it was found that Muzaffar had already left for a village owned by
& Rajput named Sewa Wadbel, who while fighting gallantly with Naurang Khan was
slain (Bom. Gaz. History of Gujarāt p 272) Jagat was also called Dwārkā (Aine Ak,
Vol. II, p 248).

The firmān given to Jinacandra Sūri was lost or misplaced. Upon this his pupil
Jinasimba Sūri applied to the Emperor for another firmān. Akbar readıly granted on
31st Khurdad, Elāhi 49 (1605 A D ), referring therein to the firmāns granted to
Hira-Vijaya Sūri and to Jinacandra Sūri, prohibiting the slaughter of animal and
flesh-eating during the 12 days including Paryusana, and during the seven days from
Āsādha S'ukla 9th to 15th (“Sarasvati ", June, 1912, a Hindi monthly ) (For a detailed
account see Nāhtās' Hindi book entitled · Yugapradhāna Śrı Jinacandra Sūri').
II. OTHER JAINA TEACHERS AT THE COURT OF AKBAR.
We have finished the accounts of great Jaina teachers at the Court of Akbar.
Now we shall deal with some minor Jaina teachers who visited the Royal Court.
8. Padmasundara.
Padmasundara was a Jaina monk's staying at Āgrā. Akbar had formed a high
opinion of him and had great regard for him. It is said that on one occasion Akbar
made the following remarks about him while talking with Hira-Vijaya Sūrı -- There
lived some time ago a learned man named Padmasundara. He was my dear friend.
He had studied at Benares. Once a proud brahmin pandit began to style himself
*Pandita-Rāja'. Thereupon Padmasundara challenged him to a debate in which
he utterly vanquished him. Unfortunately, he died after some time, leaving me in
constant sorrow. I have preserved all his manuscripts and scriptures in my palace,
because I found that his pupils were not worthy enough to receive so rich a heritage.
It is my wish that you accept this collection as a gift from me" (Hirc-Saubhāgya-Kāvya
Ch. 14, Verses 91 to 94).
9. Nandivijaya.
Nandivijaya was a pupil of Vijayasena Sūri, and had accompanied bim to
the Court of Akbar, at Lāhore. He performed eight avadhānas at the Court, where
many feudatory kings and amīrs were present. The Emperor who was highly impressed
with the performance, conferred on him the title “Khush-faham" (a man of sharp
13 It is stated in Nāgapuriya Tapā Gaccha Pattāvalı -'Padmasundara belonged to that
Gaccha. He had very friendly relations with Akbar Ho vanquished a brāhmin pandit in
a debate. On that occasion Akbar gave him many presents including a palanquin He also
got a religious halting place erested for him at Agra." Read also f. o 488 in my Gujarāti

intellect) as stated above. (The incident is mentioned in the present work and in
Vijaya-Prasasti-Kāvya) When Vijayasena Sūrı left Akbar's Court, Nandivijaya was
kept at the Court in his place.
10. Sanayasundara.
It was from Lāhore that Akbar started on his second expedition to Kāśmır,
on Thursday 10th August 1592 A D and encamped outside the City, in the garden
of Rājā Sri Rāmadāsa A Court was held there, which was attended by prince Salım,
several vassal kings, learned brāhmins and pandits Jinacandra Sūri, with his pupils,
one of whom was Samayasundara, attended the Court on invitation. There Samaya-
sundara read out to the Emperor a work composed by him. It was “ Astalahsı”.
He explained to the Emperor that there was in it a short sentence consisting of three
simple sanskrit words ( 2757 Cat ey) which could be interpreted in eight hundred
thousand ways 14 He and Gunavīnaya were invested with the title of Upādhyāya when
the title of Yugaprridhāna was granted to Jinacandra Sūrı by Akbar as stated above

According to 'An Indian Ephemeris' by Pillai S'ravana S'ukla 13 S Y 1649 corresponds
with Thursday 10th August 1592, while Beveridge in his translation of Akbarnāmā puts
dates of July 1592 A D for Akbar's expedition & halt at Rāmbārı as under
"On 24th (Tır), 4th July 1592 H M set off to Kashmir and his first stage was this same
garden (of Rām Dās called Rām bārı) On the 27th, 300 little stars fell from west to east.
The Indian astronomers represented that if the first stage exhibited such an appearance,
they should return and set out again at a chosen hour. The Shāh and the Shāhzādã were
obliged to go back (to Lahore)" Vol III p 942 Thereafter "On 12 Amardad, 22nd July
1592, inspite of clouds of rain and the opposition of men, he set out. On the 17th he
advanced from Rāmbārı". Ibid p. 943.
V Smith correctly places Akbar's start for Käs'mir in August 1592 and that bears out
Samayasundara's date of 10-8-1592 for Akbar's halt at Rambāri.

11. Harsasāra
He was a monk belonging to the Kharatara Gaccha. He had once an interview
with Akba1.15
12. Jayasoma.
Jayasoma once scored a victory at a debate conducted at the Court of Akbar. 18
He was a member of Kharatara Gaccha and was invested with the title “ Pāthaka” on
the 2nd of Fāgan S'ud, S. Y. 1649, The reader will remember that on the same day Akbar
had conferied the title “ Yuga-Pradhāna” on Jinacandra Sūri, and the title “ Ācārya"
on Mānasımba at Lāhore Both these also were members of the Kharatara Gaccha.
13. Sādhukīrti.
In the presence of many learned men at the Court of Akbar, Sadhukırtı
vanquished a proud disputant, in a debate held on the subject of a Jaina religious ceremony,
called “Pausadha”. Akbar, thereupon, conferred on him the title “ Vadindra” 17
A perusal of the foregoing pages will make it evident to the reader that many
Jaina teachers both of Tapā and of Khaiatara groups, attended constantly the Court of
Akbar. Chief among them, persons who vastly influenced the mental and spiritual
outlook of Akbar-were Hīravijāya Sūri, Vijayasena Sūri and Bhānucandra Upādhyāya.
All the three were members of the Tapā Gaccha. From S. Y. 1639 onwards some
Jaina teachers or others stayed at his Court. Hīravijaya Sūrı explained to him all
the principal tenets of Jainism, and he always inspired the highest respect for himself
Since then, the Jainas exercised far greater influence upon his habits and mode of life than
did the Jesuits. The tax levied on the pilgrims to the Satrunjaya Hill was abolished,
all the Jaina holy places were placed under the control of the Jainas themselves. It was
at the bidding of his Jaina teachers that Akbar gave up flesh-eating and prohibited
the killing or encaging of birds and animals (Vide p. 406, A Short History of Muslim
Rule in India, Ist Ed pp. 406-7 by Prof. Ishyarprasad ).
15 Vide a verse in the colophon of Sangrahanı Bālāvabodha by his pupil Śivanidhāna a copy
of which is in Bikaner Brhat Jnāna Bhandāra -

INTRODUCTION.

Pinheiro, a Portuguese priest, stated in a letter from Lāhore dated 3rd September,
1595, “He (Akbar) follows the sect of the Vertei (Sanskrit-Vratis-Jainas).”
Mr. Vincent Smith rightly states -“ Akbar never came under Buddhist influence in
any degree whatsoever. No Buddhist took part in the debates on religion held
at Fatehpur Sikri, and Abu-l-Fazl never met any learned Buddhist. Consequently,
his knowledge of Buddhism was extremely slight. Certain persons who took part in the
debates and who have been supposed erroneously to have been Buddhists, were really
Jains from Gujarāt. Many Jains visited the imperial Court or resided there at various
times during at least twenty years from 1578 to 1597 A. D and enjoyed ample facilities
for access to the Emperor."
"The potency of the influence exercised by Jain teachers on the ideas and policy
of Akbar has not been recognised by historians No reader of the works of Elphinstone,
Von Noer or Malleson would suspect that he listened to the sermons of the Jain holy men
so attentively that he is reckoned by Jain Wuters among the converts to their religion,
or that many of his acts from 1582 A D on-wards were the direct outcome of his partial
acceptance of the Jain gospel. Even Blochman failed to perceive that three of the most
learned men of the time, enumerated in Abu-l-Fazl's long list, were eminent Jain gurus
or religious teachers, namely Hıra Vijaya Sūri, Vijaya Sena Sūri, and Bhānucandra
Upādhyāya The first of them the most distinguished of the three, and credited by Jain
authors with the honour of having converted Akbar (to Jainism ), *is placed by
Abu-l-Fazl along with twenty others, including Saikh Mubaraka, in the first of the five
classes of the learned-among the select few who “understand the mystery of both
the worlds." The other two also were the most influential persons who initiated
the Emperor to the significance of Jain doctrines.
“Akbar's action in abstaining almost wholly from eating meat and in issuing
stringent prohibitions resembling those of Asoka, restricting to the narrowest possible
limits the destruction of animal life, certainly was taken in obedience to the doctrine of his
Jain teachers."
“The Emperor granted various favours to the Jain community. Abu-l-Fazl made
use of his opportunities (of coming into close contact with Jain priests) to compile
an exacellent and generally accurate account of the Svetambara sect, by gleaning
information from the various learned men of that community, especially from Hira Vijaya
Sūri*. He failed to come across any learned member of the Digambara sect, and
consequently observed that his account of the Digambara peculiarities has been written
as it were in the dark. "18 (Vide “Akbar the Great Mogul”, and also the article,

BHĀNT CANDRA CARITRÀ
III JAINA TEACHERS AT THE COURT OF JAHANGIR.
Sekhooji-prince Salim-was the eldest son of Akbar, by his Rājput wife, Jodhbāı,
the princess of Jodhpur. He was born under very auspicious circumstances a child of so
many prayers, vows and pilgrimages, a darling of all the inmates of the palace, and
consequently, a spoilt child At the age of 36, he ascended the Mogul throne at Āgrā,
and assumed the lofty title “Nuruddin Mohammad Jahāngir Pādsāb Gāzı."
He had every desire to follow the foot-steps of his illustrious father. He believed
in religious toleration and always desired to treat the religious teachers of his father with
high respect Just treatment of his subjects was one of his most cherished ideals.
He was, however, a man of very quick termperament, and was easily excitable. These
defects of temperament combined with his passionate addiction to vices never allowed him
to come to the level of his father.
Rev. Tarry, who stayed in India between 1617 and 1619 A. D., says in his
Voyage to East India—"Jahangir's temperament is composed of extremes; for, some-
times he was barbarously cruel, and at other times, he would seem to be exceedingly fair
and gentle .All religions are tolerated and their priests held in good esteem”
Jaipa documents afford ample testimony to the fact that he revered the Jaina
teachers at his Court and that on the whole, he treated the Jaina order with sympathy.
In spite of this, however, some incidents show that on some occasions, in a fit of passion,
he treated some of the Jaina priests rather cruelly For instance, as related in this work,
he asked its author Siddhicandra, who was a Jaina Priest and was vowed to celibacy,
to marry. He issued the order at a time when he was heavily drunk, When Siddhicandra
politely but firmly refused to comply with this absurd command, he, in a paroxysm of
rage, dismissed him from his Court, and also issued a general order for the banishment
of all Jaina priests from his kingdom. When his anger subsided, and he was able to
think clearly, he withdrew the order as quickly as he had issued it Under the stress of
the same emotion however, he is said to have written down the following remarks about
the Jainas-remarks, which in no way should be taken as representing his attitude towards
them in his saner moments
“The sect of the Sewrās (Svetambara monks) exists in most of the cities of India,
but is especially numerous in Gujalāt. As the Banyāns are the chief traders there,
consequently the Sewrās also are plentiful. Besides making idol-temples for them,
they (the Banyās) have also built houses for them to dwell in and to worship in. In fact,
these houses are the head-quarters of sedition. The Banyāns send their wives and
daughters to the Sewrās who have no shame or modesty. All kinds of strife and audacity
are perpetrated by them, I, therefore, ordered that the Sewrās should be expelled,
and I circulated firmans to the effect that wherever there were Sewrās in my empire, they
should be turned out” (Tūzuk-Jahāngīrī or Memoirs of Jahāngır Yol, I, P. 438,
translated by Rogers ).

INTRODUCTION.
The reader can see that most of the statements made above in defence of his
unreasonable and arbitrary order of banishment, as an outcome of intoxication and a fit
of anger, are in absolute contravention of facts
Mr. Vincent Smith, in his "Akbar” states — Jehangir, a strange mixture of
opposites, was equally capable of intense love and devilish cruelty. He, when safely
established with his court at Allahbad, far removed from parental supervision, abandoned
himself without restraint to his favourite vices, consuming opium and strong drink to such
an extent that his naturally fierce temper became ungovernable. The most fearful
penalties were inflicted for trivial offences, pardon was never thought of and his adherents
were struck dumb with terror A news,writer convicted of a plot against the Prince's life
was flayed alive while Salım calmly watched his long-drawn agony”.
During his reign, he took strong and drastic action against any one, if he had the
slightest suspicion that the person in question was acting or speaking against him.
Arjuna, the fourth Sikh High Priest, was ordered to be executed by him for political
reasons. Manasımba (Jinasimha Sūri of Kharatara Gaccha), was reported to have
predioted against him. So, when he received the news of his death, he is said to have
made the following remarks about him -
“On Tuesday (Fagan Sud 3, S. Y 1674 1. e. 17-2-1618 A.D.), I marched 51 Kos,
and halted at the village of Jarsıma (Chānasmā). At this stage, news came to me that
Man Singh Sewrā surrendered his soul to the lords of hell. The account of this in brief
is that, the Sewrās are a tribe of infidel Hindus who always go with their head and feet
bare. One set of them, root out their hair, their beards and moustaches, while another
set shave them. They do not wear sewn garments, and their central principle is that no
living creature should be injured. The Banyāns regard them as their pirs and teachers,
and even worship them There are two sects of Sewrās, one is called Pata (Tapā)
and the other Kanthal-Kartal (Kharatara). Mān Singh was the head of the latter,
and Bal Chand (Bhānchand) was the head of the Patas (Tapās). Both of them used
to attend upon H. M. Akbar. When he died and Khusrau fled, and I pursued him, Ray
Singh Bhurtiyā, Zamındar of Bikanır, who had been made an Amir by Akbar's kindness,
asked Man Singh what would be the duration of my reign, and the chances of my success.
That black-tongued fellow, who pretended to be skilled in astrology and the extraction
of judgments, said to him that my reign would, at most, last for two years. The
doting old idiot (Rāy Singh) relied upon this, and went off without leave to his home.
Afterwards, when the glorious God chose out this suppliant and I returned victorious to
the capital, he came, ashamed and down-cast, to Court. What happened to him in the
end has been told in its proper place
“In fine, Mān Singh in the course of three or four months, was struck with leprosy
(juzām), and his limbs fell off him till he was in such a state that death was by many
degrees preferable to life. He was living at Bıkanır, and now I remembered him and sent
for him. On the road, he, out of excessive fear, took poison and surrendered his soul to

the lords of hell. So long as the intentions of this suppliant at God's courts are just and
right, it is sure that whoever devises evil against me will receive retribution according
to his merits.” (Tūzuk-1-Jahāngirī or Memoirs of Jahāngir Vol. I, pp 437–8 Translated
by Rogers).
Facts do not bear out the account given above Jaina monks are prohibited from
predicting any one's future by a religious injunction Māna Simha was never expected to
predict anything for any one, and his death by leprosy is a myth. Jaina documents
plainly tell us that he died at Medatā (Mertā) on the 13th day of dark half of Paoșa
S. Y 1674. Hindi (Monday 15th December 1617 A D) Both Akbar and Jahāngir
treated him with utmost respect, as will be shown later on. The statement given above
was the result of a fit of ill humour. His flatterers had poisoned his ears by constantly
telling him evil things about Māna Simha.
During his reign many Jaina idols were consecrated and installed in temples and in
the inscriptions of some of them the name of Pātaśāha Jahāngira was also engraved
It is said, some out of malice or fanaticism reported to him that his name was being
engraved at the foot of the idols. He was greatly enraged. In order to passify him,
his name was engraved on the heads of the idols. (See Inscriptions Nos 1578 to 1584
of S. Y 1671 Vaišākha Sudı 3 Saturday and a footnote on p 131, Nāhar II )
It may be that the views expressed in the memoirs may not be of Jahāngir
himself. “It seems very probable that the Emperor kept two or more memoir-writers,
to whom he gave directions as to the event they were to record, and a general expression
of his opinion on the various subjects to be noticed. It may be that in some instances
he wrote down or dictated the words he wished to be recorded, but it is more likely that
in most cases his (auto) biographers followed their own bent in composing their respective
records.” Elliot's History of India Vol. VI, p 255.
- A writer of Intıkhāb-1-Jahāngir-shāhi writes “One day at Ahmedābād it was
reported that many of the infidel and superstitious sect of the Seorās (Jains) of Gujarāt
had made several very great and splendid temples, and having placed in them their false
gods, had managed to secure a large degree of respect for themselves, and that the women
who went for worship in those temples were polluted by them and other people. Seorā is
a sect of people in whose religion to be always barefooted and bareheaded, is considered as
one of the modes of worship, and to drink always warm water, and to pull out the hair of
their head and beard, is reckoned as one of the deeds of virtue They wear no other dress
than a shirt of cloth. The Emperor Jahāngir ordered them to be banished from the
country, and their temples to be demolished. Their idol was thrown down on the upper-
most step of the mosque, that it might be trodden upon by those who came to say their
daily prayers there. By this order of the Emperor, the infidels were excceedingly
disgraced, and Islam exalted x x x" [Elliot VI, pp. 451 and 452)
The description of Seorās i, e. Jaina monks of Svetambara sect, given above is
a malignant misrepresentation. It is false & malicious aspersion to attribute adultery to

them. Impelled by a fanatical zeal, other religions and their preachers were run down and
condemned by muslims under the impression that by doing so their own religion would
be exalted Wherever racial, cultural, and religious conflicts take place, prejudices and
condemnations are bound to occur Human nature has been the same at all times and in
all climes.
By false aspersions and reports conveyed to Jahāngir, he was easily led to pass un-
warranted oppressive orders Prof Beniprasad says ---" He passed an order of persecution
against the Shwetāmbar Jains of Gujarat because their leader Man Singh had, on the out-
break of Khusrau's death, prophesied the downfall of Jahāngir's empire within two years
and because their houses were reputed, though wrongly, to be hotbeds of sedition and
immorality. Sometime after the order was withdrawn” History of Jahāngir pp. 443-
444. In the foot-note there he adds “The Persian chroniclers do not mention the
withdrawal of the order against the Jains, but the Jain works of the period are clear on
the point." The present work is one of them.
“Jehangir was a great drinker, but was also ashamed of his vice, and cruelly
punished those, who talked of his orgies or of the part they took in them” (Rawlinson ).
Neither religion nor piety had struck deep roots in Jahāngir's heart; yet he was
a sincere believer in God, and always respected those saints—be they Muslim or Hindu
or Jain—who had dedicated their lives to the service of God. He was also interested in
intellectual discussions with learned men like Jadroop, Bhānucandra and others. Barring
a few exceptions here and there, his religious policy was that of toleration. Like his
revered father, he also prohibited animal-slaughter on certain fixed days in a year,
though the number of days was not as large as the number which Akbar had fixed. The
extract quoted below, from his Memoirs (p. 9) will make this amply clear.
"In accordance with the regulations of my revered father I ordered that each year
from the 18th of Rabiul-awwal, which is my birth-day, for a number of days, corres-
ponding to the years of my life, they should not slaughter animals (for food). Two days,
in each week were also forbidden, one of them Thursday, the day of my accession, and the
other Sunday, the day of my father's birth He (Akbar) held this day in great esteem
on this account, and because it was dedicated to the Sun, and also because it was the
day on which the Creation began. Therefore it was one of the days on which there
was no killing in his dominions”.
We shall now deal with the Jaina teachers at the court of Jahāngır.
1-2 Bhānucandra and Siddhicandra.
About them something has been said before on p. 9 and their account is related in
the Summary of this work and more facts will follow thereafter.

3-4 Jinacandra Sūri and Jinasinha Sūri.
We have already noted what part they played at the court of Akbar. During
Jahāngir's reign when he issued a firmān banishing all Jaina priests, Jinacandra Sūri was
passing his monsoon at Pătan (S Y. 1668). It is said that when the Sūrı heard about
the firmān, he forth with sped towards Agrā and had an audience with the emperor there,
(S. Y 1669 ) with the result that the firmān was cancelled The Sūri passed the monsoon
of that year at Āgia. The next monsoon he stayed at Bilādā, where he breathed his last.
(Āśvin Vadı 2nd S Y. 1670 Hındı 1. e. Sunday 22nd August 1613 A. D.)
Jinasimha Sūrı (Mānasımha) was his successor. It is said that he was also
invested with the title “ Yuga-pradhāna” at the instance of Jahāngır. The bestowal
ceremony was performed by his agent Makrabkhān. The Sūri died at Medta on the 13th
of Posa (dark half), 1674 S Y while on his way to see the Emperor who had invited him
to his court When Jahāngir heard of his death, he is alleged to have penned lines about
him in Tūzuki-Jahāngīrī, as already mentioned which bespeak what was his inner motive
and why he welcomed his death.
5-8 Vivekaharsa,19 Paramānanda, Mahānanda and Udayaharşa.
They were pupils of Vijayasena Sūri, Vijayadeva Sūri, and Nandivijaya-bearing
the title, “Khus-faham". In compliance with their request, a filmān was issued on 26th
of Farvardın 5th year (1610 A D ), prohibiting animal-slaughter during the 12 days of
Paryusana. All the four were members of the Svetāmbara Tapā Gaccha. (For the
text of the firmān, vide Appendix)
9 Vijayadeva Sūri.
While Jahāngir was residing at Manduº, where he often discussed the principles of
Jaina philosophy with the learned men at his Court, he heard that a Jaina monk named
19 Vivekaharsa secured royal orders prohibiting animal-slaughter and releasing captives from
the Kings of Konkan, King Burbānshahi, Mahāraj Sri Rāmrā), Khān Khānā, Navarang Khān
and others He also made the king of Cutch, Bhārmal (S Y. 1642 to 1688) sympathise
with Jaina religious doctrines and consecrated an idol at the village named Khākhar in Cutch
in S Y 1659 (Inscription No 446, Jinavijaya II) In Jahāngir's times, he installed several
Jaina idols at his capital Agrā on S Y 1667 Māgha Sudi 6 Thursday 1 e 10-1-1611 AD
(Vide Jaina Satya Prakāśa Vol II No 9 pp 508-509). That at the request of Pandita's
Vivekaharsa and Udayabarsa, two firmāns given by the Emperor Jahāngir were announced by
him in the open Court in the presence of (Rāja) Rāmadāsa about or during the Paryusana
days of S Y 1667, is specifically referred to in the illustrated samvatsarzka-patra (annual
letter of apologies for the faults of the past year as per Jaina tenet) written by the Jaina
sangha of Agra to Vijayasena Sūrı at Devkāpātan (in Kathiawar) dated Monday Kārtika

Vijayadeva Sūrı had been practising severe austerities through the long course of his
ascetic life. He was also informed that austerities formed the cardinal principle of Jainism.
He summoned the local Jaina leader, Candrapāla by name, and gave him a firmãn
requesting the Ācārya to present himself at the Court The Acārya was then passing
the monsoon at Cambay When he received the firmān, he started from Cambay,
and reached Māndu on Aśvin Sukla 13th S. Y. 1673 Gujarāti (2–10–1617 A D )
On the following day, the Emperor gianted him an audience. On seeing him, he
was stiuck with his lustious face and personality. He questioned him on the value atta-
ched to tapās (austerities) in Jainism The Acāiya told him that the Tapā Gaccha to whom
he belonged, was founded by a very austere Samna High Priest It was named Tapā from
"tapas" meaning austerities. He also said that he was a member of that Gaccha.
The Emperor, highly impressed by the Sūrı, conferied on him the title of “Jahāngir-
Mahātapā” (a great austere man recognised by Jahāngir) In accordance with the
Emperor's orders, the Sūrı was taken to his retreat in a procession, with the royal band
playing and the whole Jaina congregation following The Emperor stood in the gallery of
his palace and watched the procession with interest and delight. At the time of this visit
of the Sūrı, several other incidents took place, in which some part was played by
Nemisāgara Upādhyāya, Bhānucandia and Siddhicandıa, details about these incidents
will be given in their respective accounts Various inscriptions bear out the fact that
Vijayadeva Sūri was the recipient of the title “ Mahā-Tapā” from Jahāngir (No 1460 of
S Y. 1674 Māgha Vadı 1 Thursday (1-1-1617 A. D.) Nabār II, No. 207 of S. Y.

Sūri-Māhātmyam”-a Sanskrit Poem by Śrı Vallabha Upādhyāya of Kharatara Gaccha,
edited by Jinavijaya).
10 Nemisāgara Upādhyāya
At the invitation of Vijayadeva Sūri, Nemisāgara started from Rādhanpur
and reached Māndu to join the Sūrı. He was also granted an audience by Jahāngır.
A controversy that had been started several years ago, about a book by Dharmasāgara
Upādhyāya, was still going on The book in question (Sarvagna Satcoka by Dharma
Sagara was almost a second edition of his Pravacanapariksā nick-named Utsitra-Kanda
Kuddala) condemned and proscribed by Hiravijaya Sūri and by his successor Vijayasena
Sūri. The question was submitted to the Emperor who heard the view-points of both the
sides-Vijayadeva Sūri and Nemısāgara Upādhyāya on the one side and Nandivijaya
and Bhānucandra on the other. Jahāngir aeked them to follow their former masters'
views and live in peace.
Nemisāgara died at Māndu about this time (on Kartak Sud 10 S. Y
1674-
“After a leisurely journey of more than four months, the Imperial party entered Mandu
on March 6th 1617” (1 e Monday, Fagan Sud 7th S Y. 1673) and left for Gujrat on Friday,
Kartak Sud 5, S Y 1674"-Jahāngir-nămā. Jahāngir thus stayed for 8 months at Mandu.

IV. SUMMARY OF PRESENT WORK.
This book appears in print for the first time. It is an attempt at the biography of
Bhānucandra, a Jaina monk at the Court of Akbar. The author is Siddhicandra,
a disciple of the biographee. The book in the present form consists of 749 verses divided
into four Prakāśas (Chaptars), containing 128, 187, 76 and 358 verses respectively.
First Chapter-The first five verses are benedictory. The author invokes the five
Jinas, namely, Rşabhanātha, śāntinātha, Neminātha, Pārsvanātha and Vardhamāna
(Mahāvīra).
In the succeeding verses the author expresses his inability to do justice to all
the events of the life of his noble and virtuous master He states that though not endowed
with a comprehensive frame of mind, he humbly intends to shed some light on the life of
Bhānucandra, be the task as difficult as trying to cross the boundless ocean in a fragile
boat. With this manifestation of modesty which becomes him well, he introduces us to
the personality of his biographee briefly and generally in the following terms.-

He taught Akbar one thousand names of the Sun, correctly, Akbar, under his
influence, issued firmāns prohibiting animal-slaughter and abolishing tax on pilgrims
to the Satrunjaya Hill &c.
The greatest among ascetics, he composed a commentary on the Sun (Sūryce
Sahasra-Nāma), commentaries on Vasantarāja's S'akuna (a book on omens), on
Kādambarı ( by Bāna), on Kāvya-Prahās'a (by Mammata), on Nāma-Srena ( Anekārthcka
Nāmamālā-a lexicon of Sanskrit words), on Viveka Vilāsa (by Jinadatta Sūrı), and on
other good works.
Jahāngir, who had issued an order deporting all ascetics in Gujarāt, revered him
and restored him and his pupil, Siddhicandra Upādhyāya, to their original position at his
Court (Verses 9 to 12)
The following, says the author, is a brief account of this great monk who had
the honour of preaching the Jaina gospel to Akbar and who thus enhanced the glory
of Jainism at his Court. There is not a single exaggerated statement in this account,
neither can the charge of wilful omissions be levelled against it It gives truth, and
nothing but truth.
Verses 14 to 38 contain details about the city of Ugrasena (Agrā) 21 It is situated
on the banks of the Kālındı (Jamnā), which flows into the sea after merging with
the mighty Ganges at Prayāga Merchants-and rich ones at that-carry on a roaring
trade there, in elephants, horses, buds, bulls, slaves, cloths, diamonds, sweet fruits,
vegetables for all seasons, and in hosts of other things It is thickly populated. Hundreds
of kings visit the city. Towering temples decked with diamond-studded pillars are built
there It contains no small number of multimillinonaires who can stand comparison with
Kubera, and it is no less catching in appearance than Alakā (the metropolis of Kubera).
Details about Akbar are given in Verses 39 to 65 He was the Rāma of the
Mogul dynasty. Thieves and robbers were conspicuous by their absence in his empire.
His glory was white as moon, because he had defeated all his enemies. His religious
fervour never ebbed, as is shown by his high regard for all the six systems of philosophy.
He took active interest in all arts and in all branches of learning. On the battle-field
21 Agra -18 a pleasant city with a healthy climate The river Jamna meanders through it in a
stretch of 5 kos, and on both the banks are rows of delightful yıllas and charming meadows
It contains peoples of all climes and colours and is an emporium of world trade
His Majesty has got built there a fort of red stone, the like of which the eyes of travellers
have never met There are in it more than five hundred buildings in masonry, they are
architectural models designed by artists from Bengal and Gujrat, and are noteworthy for
their excellant sculpture and delicacy of form At the eastern gate are two stone-elephants
with riders, graven with exquisite skıll, In former times, Agr& was a village under
the power of Biānah Sultan Sikandar Lodi selected it as the seat of his capital, his present
Majesty has embellished it and transformed it into a matchless city” (Aine Akbarı II,

Dāniyāl as his birth took place at Ajmer in the house of one of the attendants of the Shrine
of Chishti whose name was Shaikh Dāniyāl. After death of Murād he was sent to conquer
and was successful, he too died from excessive drinking in the 33rd year of his age.
23 The strength of Akbar's army Blochman states -"We have not sufficient data to form
an exact estimate of the strength of Akbar's army We can, however, guess it as 25000 men
(troopers, musketeers and artillery) Imperial stables contained 12000 horses hence about
12000 standing cavalry. The rest were matchlock-bearers and artillery. Abul Fazl states
that there were 12000 match-lock bearers" (Aine Akbarı Vol I, pp 245–6). We find in
Noer I p 286 _"Abul Fazl gives the effective strength of 44 lacs of men. The standing
army-the troops in pay-were, according to Badaoni, 25000, and in the latter years of
Akbar's reign, they consisted of some 12000 troopers and 13000 artillery and match-lock
men-the banduqchis”
24 Abul Fazl was the learned unorthodox theologian who had shown extraordinary preco-
city and had spent a studious youth He succeeded, in 1574 A, D, by means of a
Koranic commentary, in attracting the attention of the Emperor He occupied an informal
position as Secretary of State and Private Secretary, which secured him, in practice greater
power than if he had been Vakıl or Vizier His brilliant official success was due partly
to his exceptional intellectual gifts and partly to his adroitness as a courtier. He was the
author of Akbarnāmā and Aini-Akbarı (or “Institutes of Akbar”). The former is the
leading authority for the narrative of events in Akbar's reign and the latter is, in short,
a descriptive and statistical survey of the empire, combined with & detailed account
of the Court and of the administrative system He met his death in 1602 (12-8-1602)
by a murderous attack at the instance of Prince Salım in the fifty second year of his age".

his intellectual friend and companion. He had drunk deep at the Pierian Spring
his mastery over, and grasp of, various schools of philosophy was simply amazing
The following list will give an idea of how many things his head carried, though the list is
by no means exhaustive -Jainism, Mīnāmsās, Buddhism, Sānkhya, Vaišesika, Cārvāka,
Jaimıniya, Pātanjala Yoga, Vedānta, Vocabulary and Lexicogiaphy, Music, Dramaturgy,
Rhetorics, Purānas, Prosody, Science of Omens, Astrology, Politics, Sexiology, Mathe-
matics, Palmistry, Veterinary etc etc In short, there was no branch of learning which
did not come within the grasp of this intellectual giant The serenity of his temperament,
his forgiving nature and his foi esightedness were only some of the many striking qualities
of head and heart with which he was endowed When Murād-Akbai's son-was in trouble,
Akbar appointed the Saikh as the general of his army, and sent him to his rescue. Murad
died and the army was thoroughly oiganised by the Saikh In appreciation of this
service of his, the Emperor conferred on him the title “ Dalathambharica” (Pillar of the
army2Ⓡ ). (77).
The remaining rerses of the chapter are devoted to the account of Hila-
Vijaya Sūri.
Once upon a time the Emperor inquired of his Sāmantas ( Officers), who had
returned from Gujarāt, whether they had seen or heard of any saint who was austere,
free from desires, dispassionate, calm in appearance and who had subdued his senses.
They replied that a Jaina priest named Hira-Vijaya Sūri was reported to possess all the
qualities mentioned by the emperor (Verses 78 to 95). Akbar then sent a firmān to
Sāhibkhān, the Subā (Governor) of Gujarāt, asking him to request the priest to go
to Āgrā. Sāhibkhān inquired of the S'rāvahas (Jaina laity) of Rājadranga (Ahmedābād) 27
the whereabouts of the Acārya. They informed him that the Ācārya was residing
at Gandhāras where Sāhibkhān sent him the royal message. The Sūri forthwith came
26 Abul Fazl himself states -"In consequence of their (of some interested parties) intrigues,
I was sent off on the 25th Dai (about 5th January 1599—4th of Pausa Vadi S Y 1655)
to bring Prince Sultān Murād An order was given that if the officers of the Deccan should
take upon themselves the supervision of the country, I was to come to Court with the Prince
Otherwise, I was to send him off and to work in harmony with the others, and to act
according to the opinion of Mirzā Shahrukh" Akbar-Nämā III. D 1119 Abul Fazl

arranging of the army, the guarding of the country, and the capturing of places that had not
been taken” p 1131, “Akbarnāmā" III.

to Ahmedābād and had an interview with Sāhibkhān, who offered him a conveyance and
other facılıties for his journey The Ācārya politely thanked him for his kind offer and
said that he could not accept them because Jaina monks were forbidden by a religious
tenet to accept any such means of material comfort A few days later, the Sūri started
from Ahmedābād, and preaching the Jaina gospel at every village and town on his way,
where he was accorded a warm reception, he finally reached Agrā to go to Fatehpur.29
At Āgiā the whole Jaina community headed by Sthānasımhas' and others celebrated
the occasion of his arrival with great eclat, and paid homage to the monk with offerings
of gold and silver coins to the accompaniment of musical instruments (110)
On that very day (Jyestha Vadı 13th S Y 1639-Monday 18th June 1582 A. D.)
the Ācārya was escorted to the Emperor's presence by Abul Fazl The Empepror received
him and greeted him warmly. After some preliminary remarks about the Sūri's health,
the Emperor put him a direct question “What was true religion ?" The Sūri replied
that the religion, the foundation of which was compassion (dayā) was the best.
The Emperor, though fond of hunting; was convinced of the truth of what the Sūrı said.
The Sūri's words had touched his heart deeply. He respectfully bowed to him and, with
folded hands, said that he could not think of any fit present for the Sūri, who had
renounced all worldly comforts, except a Jaina Libiary located in his palace He requested
the Sūri to accept that gift of him and thus oblige him. All the Jaina books were brought
there and were presented to the Ācārya. Again the Emperor requested the Sūri to ask
of him anything he required. Then the Sūrı asked him to prohibit animal-slaughter
during the eight days of the Paryusana holidays Not only did the Emperor readily
accede to this request, but he went a step further and prohibited animal-slaughter for
four other days The Sūri's dignified calmness of appearance and renunciation of worldly
desires highly impiessed the Emperor. Then the interview ended-an interview in which
Kāvi, Gandhār, Bhābhut and Bhankorā are its dependencies Aine Akbarı II, P 243.

the Ācārya had rendered no small ser vice to Jainism He stayed in that country for four
monsoons and then started for Gujarāt, leaving his pupil śānticandra Upādhyāya
at the Court. After his departure, the Emperoí again went to Lābhapuia (Lahore)
(in 1586–7 A. D ). (127)
Second Chapter-The geneology of Bhānucandra is the subject of the first
21 verses of the second Prahās'a. In the non-idolatoJaina sect, Lumpāka by name
(Lumpāka is a Sanskrit vulgai teim coined from the name of its founder, Lunkā or Lonkā.
The sect is at present called “Sthānakavāsı”-a iefined teim), there was a learned monk,
Hāna Rsi by name He had dived deep into the ocean of Jaina sacied literature,
as a result of which he could not help coming to the conclusion that worship of Jina idols
was an essential tenet of Jainism. He left his own sect and joined the Tapā Gaccha-one
of the idolator Jaina Śvetāmbaia groups-along with his hundred disciples One of these
disciples was Sakalacandra Upādhyāya. It is said of him that while festive preparations
were going on for his marriage, he renounced the world and was initiated into Jaina
priesthood, just like Jambukumāra (later on Jambusvāmı, a desciple of Sudharmā Svāmı,
a prominent successor of Lord Mahāvīra) He composed a poem in Gujarāti entitled
“Sattarabhedi Jina-Pujā” (17 ways of worshipping Jinas). The poem is very popular
and is till now being sung in every village and town by the Jaina laity. Sakalacandra had
many learned pupils, amongst whom Sūracandra and Sānticandra were the principal ones.
Sūracandra was a man of high intellectual attainments. It was said about him that his
genius shone as if he were a Krsna-bhār atr (1 e. Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, darkly
arrayed). He composed verses on the spur of the moment and always carried the palm
in debates (1-21).
Amongst his pupils, one, Bhānucandra by name, was the most prominent,
He studied at his master's feet and acquired mastery over Jaina scriptures Out of
affection, Hira-Vijaya Sūri himself conferred on him (Bhānucandra) the title
“ Praina” (Pandita, Pan-nyāsa). He was regarded as Gautama (the first desciple of
Lord Mabāvīra) incarnate, and was revered by all as the crowning jewel of Tapā Gaccha.
He initiated into his order many sons of wealthy Banias. He blanched his opponents
like the sun, and soothed his adherents like the moon. Hence his name was most
appropriate to, and in keeping with, his virtues. Hīra-Vijaya Sūrı deputed him to the
Court of Akbar, hoping confidently that much good would accrue to the Jaina Order out
of his influence over the Emperor (33 ).
In obedience to the order of the Acārya, Bhānucandra went to Lābhapura (Lāhore)
where he was received with great jubilation by the Jaina laity He put up at the
upās'raya (a halting place for Jaina monks). His friend Abul Fazl escorted him to
the royal Court where the Emperor granted him an audience. His personality and his
manner and ease of answering the questions put to him impressed the Emperor profoundly.
31 He was at first a pupil of Jivaji of Surat belonging to Lonkā Gaccha He left that fold
and took initiation from Hemavimala Sūrı of Tapā Gaccha in S Y 1582 See J G K. III.
p 1694. The Sūrı placed him under his pupıl Kus'alamānikya i named him Sahajakus'ala,
as I find from one pattāvalz with me.

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
He requested him to visit the Court everyday and instructed the gate-keeper to see that
all facilities were given to the monk to come and see him without let or hindrance.
Accordingly Bhānucandra used to pay daily visits to the court where he was received
with honour.
Saikh (Abul Fazl) expressed his desire to study under him “Şad-dars'anom
Samuccaya" (A treatise expounding the six Systems of Philosophy, compiled by
Haribhadra Sūri, a commentary upon which is written by Gunaratna Sūri. Read
paragraphs 217 and 672 of my "Short History of Jaina Literature”) Bhānucandra readily
agreed to do so Abul Fazl always made notes of what the monk taught him.
Attachment between them grew very much on account of this.
Upādhyāya Śānticandra z ealızıng that his further stay at the Court served no
useful purpose, approached the Saikh and requested him to procure royal permisson for
his departure The Emperor granted the permission but instructed the Saikh to inform
Sānticandra that Bhānucandra's presence at the Court was desired by him. Accordingly
he departed for Gujarāts (65)
During his stay at the Court Bhānucandra distinguished himself for his extra-
ordinary intellectual attainments Once upon a time the Emperor asked the Brāhmins
to enumerate to him one thousand names of the Sun The Brāhmins failed in the attempt,
fortunately for them, however, a highly talented person did the work for them. Then they
submitted the compilation to the Emperor. With great delight at the attainment of his
desire, the Emperor asked them who was competent enough to explain to him the
significance of those names. The Brāhmins replied that only that person was fit to do it,
who had subdued his passions, who slept on the ground and who led a celebate life.
Thereupon the Emperor told Bhānucandra that only he possessed those qualifications and
requested him to read to and teach him those names every morning (71)
It was the Emperor's habit to get out of bed at early dawn. Arraying himself in
royal robes, he used to occupy the royal chair (simhāsana) placed in the centre of
the royal Court on a raised platform The magnificence of Akbar's Court beggars
description. With musical instruments playing sweet melodies, with gate-keepers and
door-keepers in their liveries standing at their proper places, with a row of feudatory
princes paying their respects to His Majesty, with numerous courtiers bustling hither and
thither, with singers and dancers and wrestlers vying with one another to please
His Majesty and to stand in his favour, with attendants carrying boxes of jewels and
other valuables sent as presents to His Majesty by kings and governors from various parts
32 In Hira-Saubhāgya-Kāvya-Ch 14 versess 270 and 271 it is stated that śānticandra
approached Akbar and said that he would ask Bhānucandra to stay at the Court at Fatehpuri
and requested him to grant him permission to depart because he wanted to be by the side of
Hira-Vijaya Sürı The Emperor granted him permission to go and gave him firmān set with
his own seal, abolishing Jazıā tax and prohibiting animal-slaughter, in appreciation of his
having daily heard from him Krpa-rasa-Kośc composed by him at the instance of Hira-
Vijaya Sūrı" For further details see before at pp 8 and 9.

of India, with elephants and camels and horses of the best breed nicely ariayed in
the spacious courtyard-the Court presented a sight hitherto unrivalled in splendour and
majesty. The first thing that the Emperor did after entering the Court was to repeat
the thousand names of the Sunë as uttered by Bhānucandra with great devotion, with his
face towards the Sun and with folded hands. Bhānucandra recited these names with him.
This ioutine enhanced the reputation and respect of the Jaina monk to a very high degree.
Jaina oi der rose in the estimation of the people (109)
One day, the monk desırıng to uplift the poor told the Emperor that charity given
during 8 sacred days (of Paryusana) would bring about hundred-fold merit On hearing
this the Emperor expiessed his desire to fast and to give gold in charity to the distressed.
Accordingly, he took his bath, and dressed in immaculate white, sat in the Court and
distributed six thousand gold mohrs among the poor Akbar offered gold mohrs to
Bhānucandra and presseed him to accept them The monk, however, thanked him politely
for the offer and said that he could not accept anything pertaining to material comfort,
because according to his religious tenets, he as a monk and recluse was expected to be free
from worldly ties or desires At this very time the Emperor received a message from
Az1234 Kokā that the Jām35 was defeated and that his whole army had surrendered.
33 (In 991 H.) “A second order was given to the effect that the Sun should be worshipped
four times a day in the morning and evening and at noon and midnight His Majesty had
also one thousand and one Sanskrit names of the Sun collected and read thene darly, devoutly
turning towards the Sun He then used to get hold of both ears, and turning himself quickly
round about, used to strike the lower ends of his ears with his fists” (Al Badauni-Lowe's
Trans Vol II, p 332).
"A number of disciples, he called Chelāh And another lot who were not admitted into
the palace, stood every morning opposite to the window near which His Majesty used to pray
to the sun And every evenig there was a regular Court assembly of needy Hindus and
Nussalmans, all sorts of people, men and women, healthy and sick, a queer gathering and
a most horrible crowd No sooner had His Majesty finished saying the thousand and one
names of the “Greater Luminary” and stepped out into the balcony, than the whole crowd
prostrated themselves and cheating and thieving Brāhmins collected another set of
one thousand and one names of “His Majesty the Sun" and told the Emperor that he was
an incarnation, like Rām, Krishna and other infidel kings " Ibid P 336

reign he was in Gujarat, and towards the end of the 34th year he was appointed Governor
there In the 36th year, he moved against Sultan Mazaffar and defeated him in the following
year He then reduced Jām (on 8–8–1591) and other Zamındars of Cutch to obedience,

The Emperor was much pleased to hear this glad piece of news and again requested
the monk to accept a pürnapātra-a vessel or a box or a basket filled with valuable things-
often given as present to one who brought good news The monk taking advantage of this
opportunity, said that if it was His Majesty's desire to do something which would bring
happiness to him, he should issue an Order to the effect that the prisoners of war in
Saurāstra should be set free Akbar hesitated for a moment and considered whether it
was safe and sound to release the prisoners of war. In the end, however, his innate
respect for any one learned and free from worldly desires got the better of him and
he complied with the monk's request. A firmān on which was set his own seal, was issued
and was given to Bhānucandra who immediately got it despatched to Gujarāt. For this
achievement the fame of the monk spread far and wide and the glory of Jainism was
recognized by all. (121)
There was no haltiog place for Jaina monks in the fort of Lāhore. Bhānucandra,
though keenly desirous of having one, thought that the object of his desire was not easy
of achievement due to the antagonism of Muslims and other non-Jainas After some hard
thinking, he hit upon a plan. So, one day, he went to the Court to recite the names of
the Sun, later than was his wont. The Emperor asked him the cause of his being late.
Bbānucandra replied that his place of residence was far away in a crowded corner of
the city and that he had always to experience much difficulty in making his way to
the royal Court Thereupon the Emperor pointed out that he could have at his disposal
any of his palaces or an exclusive suite of rooms in any one of his palaces in the fort. The
monk thinking that it could not be available as his own or beneficial to himself in future
prayed for a gift of a piece of land for such a place of residence. The Emperor granted
his request. A piece of land was made over to the Jaina community. A magnificent
temple was crected there together with simple rooms for the residence of the monks.
An idol of Sāntinātha was consecrated there Gold jars shone upon the crystal domes of
the temple and the Jaina flag fluttered from the top of the highest dome. Thus the monk
fulfilled the long-cherished ambition of the Jaina community 88 (139)
In course of time a daughter was born to the eldest son (Salım )37 of the Emperor.
Cutch Sattarsāl, the present Rājāh, is his grandson There are many towns and the agricul-
tural area is extensive The residence of the Chief is at Nawānagar and his force consists
of 7000 cavalry and 8000 infrantry”.
36 The construction of an upăsraya at Lahore is referred to in Hir avijaya Sūri Rāsa verses
36 and 37 p 182, the cost whereof is stated to have been Rs 20,000/-
37 --Prince Salım had created a veritable harem He married several wives of various
nationalities and religions After his accession to the throne, he married a few others
including Mihurrinisā-Nür Jahān Concubines raised the harem to the monstrous number
of 300 A numerous progeny sprang from these unions" (Beniprasad)
We shall mention here from Akbarnāmā his daughters born before he came to the throne.

The daughter was born in the constellation of Mūla. Wise men told the Emperoi that it
augured evil to her father and that the evil should be checkmated by some means.
Thereupon the Emperor consulted the Master (Bhānucandra) on this point. He suggested
that it could be done effectively by performing the “ Astottara-s'ata-snático” ceremony
(108 baths to be given to the idol of Jina in its temple ) His Majesty declared that the
ceremony was to be performed without delay at the newly built residence of the priest,
and that he and Sekhuji (Prince Salım) would attend it personally. (145)
The master, thinking that Thānasımha was the proper person to look to the
details of the ceremony, entrusted him with that duty A vast hall was temporarily
erected near the upāsraya Crowds and crowds of people, out of curiosity and wonder,
flocked to the hall which proved too small to meet such onrush The Emperor sent
an invitation to Mantri Karmacandı as, the leading member of the Kharatara Gaccha,

respected by him to attend the ceremony. To the accompaniment of the royal band,
attended by the officers of the four-fold army (Infantry, Cavalry, Elephants, Chariots-
Artillery) surrounded by feudatory chiefs walking on foot, the Emperor went to attend
the ceremony. Thānasınha together with others performed the ceremony (in honour of

idol and listened to the recitation of Bhahtāmara-stotra (a sacred hymn in Sanskrit
by Mānatunga Sūli in honour of Adinātha Jina. It begins with the word “ Bhaktāmara”
hence it is called by that namc) by the master The ceremony over, the Emperor stepped
into the outer Court (ranga-mandapa) and stood there in front of the master,
Salım stood near him. Thānasimha presented elephants and horses to the Emperor.
Mantrı Karmacandra followed suit, and presented to the heir apparent a pearl necklace
worth thirteen hundred gold mohrs. Other members of the Jaina community also
showered presents of gold oi naments and gold-embroidered cloths. Then the Emperor
took some snatra-water from the gold pot and reverently applied it to his eyes and passed
the rest to the harem. He then made gifts of gold mohrs to all and permitted by the monk
returned to his palace. From that time onwards the Emperor and his son were blessed
with added happiness.39 (168)
Once the Emperor, surrounded by feudatory princes, was sitting in the Court,
while the monk was explaining to him some of his difficulties. Impressed with his mien,
manner and lucidity of exposition, the Emperor asked him what the highest title in the
Jaina order was The monk replied that “Ācārya" was the highest and the next in
order was “ Upādhyāya". On being asked which of the two titles he held, he replied
that he held neither, as these titles were conferred by the head of the Order from whom
he was far away Then the Emperor repeatedly and pressingly announced that he
conferred upon him the title “ Acārya”. Bhānucandra politely told the Emperor that he
was not yet fit to hold that title, the only person deservedly holding it at the time being
Hira-Vijaya Sūrı. The Emperor was more than ever convinced of his selflessness and
praised him in glowing terms. (178)
On the following day Abul Fazl advised the Emperor to confer on the monk
the title “ Upadhyāyce”. With festive preparations a foot, the Saikh himself rapaired
to the upās'raya and informed the Jaina laity which had assembled there that it was
of trees and killing of fish in three rivers viz Satlaj, Dek and Rāvi He got captives freed from
Baluchies The King Rai Simha having shown signs of displeasure, Karamchand went to live
at Merta and then to the Court of Akbar who made him his gangādhrkārz-bhandārı It was
at his instance that Jinacandra Sūri was called by Akbar to his Court at Lahore, as is stated
before at pp 10 to 13 (Vide Jayasomas's Sanskrit and Gunavınaya's Gujarātı Karmacandra-

INTRODUCTION.
His Majesty's desire to confer the title “ Upādhyāyce" upon the monk. The news spread
lıke wild fire and filled all who received it with delight. One of the old and wise heads of
the community, however, pointed out to the friend of Akbar (Abul Fazl) that only
the Head of the Jaina Church-the scārya Guru-had the power to confer any title upon
any one in the Order, and that titles thus conferred were only recognised by the Jaina
community So, he said, the Emperor's decision, would have to be at least ratified by
the Head, to give it any validity Thereupon the Saikh wrote out the imperial firmān and
despatched it to the Head (Hira Sūrı) who was at that time residing at Rājadhanya-
pura (Rādhanpur) Hila Sūrı readily confirmed the contents of the filmān and sent
consecrated väsch sepa and a letter of appointment to Bhānucandra, thus making valid
his competence to hold the title “ Upādhyāya ":40
Third Chapter-[First Visit to Kās'mir Kāśmīl was annexed in 1586 A D.
It was Akbar's keen desire to visit the fascinating valley of Kāśmir at the earliest
possible opportunity The valley came to be described as his private garden, after his visit.
The Emperor started from Lāhore on April 22nd, 1589, and reached Siinagar by the end
of May. Entering the hilly region through Bhımbhar, he crossed Pir Panjal ( Pantsāl)
range by the improved—though still bad-road which his Engineer-in chief had constructed.
He stayed in the valley for a few days. Prince Murād and the ladies who had been
left at Bhimbhar were directed to meet the Emperor at Rohtas near Jhelum. Akbar
travelled by the Bārā-mūla route and through the Hazāra District, then known as Pakhlī,
to Attock In accordance with the amended instructions his family met him there
instead of at Rohtās Thence the Emperor proceeded to Kābul where he spent
two pleasant months, often visiting the gardens and places of interest During his stay
there, he received news of the deaths of Rājās Bhagvāndās and Todar Mall. On Nov 7th
he started for India, leaving Kābul, in charge of Muhammad Kāsim, the Engineer
(P. 243, V. Smith's "Akbar") and reached Lāhore on 12–3-1590 (Akbarnāmā)
corresponding with Fāgan Vad 1st S Y. 1646 Thursday.
Second visit to Käs'mir -In August, 1592, Akbar started on a hunting expedition
along the banks of Chināb, intending to pay a second visit of Kāśmir While on his way,
he received news that a nephew of his governor over the valley, had rebelled and set
himself up as independent Sultan. A little later the Emperor received pleasing piece
of news, announcing the victory of the Khān Khānān in Sind He considered
the information as a good augury foz the speedy suppression of the Kāśmīr rebellion.
He was not disappointed in his expectation, for, before he entered the hills from Bhimbhar,
he had the satisfaction of seeing the rebel's head which was sent by his officers His stay
in the valley was for only eight days, during which he amused himself with sport.
Then he departed as on the previous occasion, by the Bārāmāla Pass and through
the Hazāra District (Pakhlī) to Rohtās Thence he returned to Lāhore where

intelligence reached him that Rājā Mān Singh had defeated the Afghān Chiefs in Orissa
and had annexed that country (P. 247 “Akbar.”)
It was during this second visit to Kāśmīla that the Emperor issued a firmān
abolishing tax on pilgrims to Mount Satrunjaya. Details about this will be given in
the following 3rd Chapter ]
In the Thud Chapter are given details of the way in which Bhānucandia got
the Tax levied from the pilgrims to Mount Siddha-Satrunjaya abolished by the Emperor,
so that all doubts about it may be dispelled for ever.
Once upon a time the Emperor was seated on the royal chair in his Court held in the
moining Numerous kings, with folded hands raised upto their heads as a mark of respect
were in attendance upon him A white umbrella studded with pearls stood open above his
head, while shining camaras-chowiie fans were wafted on all sides. While so seated and
attended with royal paraphernalia, the gate-keeper made his appearance and submitted
it to the Emperor that a man, hailing from Kāśmīra was standing just outside the gates,
eagerly awaiting the royal permission to present himself before His Majesty. Akbar
granted the permission The strarger entered the Court and bowed respectfully
to the Emperor. He told the Emperor that he had come all the way from Kāśmira with
the single object of paying his respects to him, because he had heard his praises everywhere.
The Emper or then asked him what kind of country Kāśmira was Thereupon the stranger
described in glowing terms the beauties of Kāśmīra.--Its snow-clad mountains, saffron
plants, multitudes of full-blown lotuses, and enchantingly charming iegions like the source
of the Brahma-putrā He gave a wonderful word-picture of Kāśmīra, which immensely
impressed the mind of the Emperor and made him keenly desirous of visiting
the country 41 Abul-Fazl supported the royal desire. On an auspicious day, previously
settled for the royal journey, the mighty Emperor started for Kāšmīra, taking the
Northern route, with a large retinue of feudatory princes, elephants, horses and chariots,
and with flags flying from numerous standards. Pressed by the Emperor, Bhānucandra
also accompanied him, staying in a nicely pitched tent with Abul-Fazl as his companion,
at the haltung-places on the way. When the Emperor and his army reached Bhambhar,
he ordered a halt there for a few days, seeing that the soldiers needed rest.
At this time, the Kharataras, intent upon having exclusive possession of the great
place of pilgrimage, Mount Vimala (Satrunjaya) were busy devising secret ways of
41 Kās'mir -"The country is enchanting and might be fittingly called a garden of perpetual
spring surrounding a citadel terraced to the skies, and deserves appropriately to be either
the delight of the worldling or the retired abode of the recluse Its streams are sweet
to taste, its waterfalls provide music to the ear, and its climate is invigorating The rain and
snow-fall are similar to that of Turkastān and Persia, and its periodical rains occur at the
same season as in Hindustan The lands are artificially watered or dependent on rain for
irrigation The flowers are enchanting and fill the heart with delight Violets and red roses
and wild narcissus flowers cover the plains. To enumerate the flora would be impossible"

achieving their aim The master came to know of this He then immediately took
the learned Saikh into his confidence and told him that the Kbarataras were devising ways
of taking possession of the sacred Mount Pundarika (another name of Satrunjaya)
which really belonged to his group (Tapās) As however, the Emperor unexpectedly
issued orders for forward march, the matter was postponed for some opportune time
in future The Emperor, after crossing Mounts Ratna-Panjāla, Pira-Panjāla42 and others,
reached Srinagar (the capital of Kāśmir) On Sunday, as was his wont, the Emperor
heard the recital and the explanations of the names of the Sun, by the master.
The recital being over, the master gently touched upon the subject of Satrunjaya,
which was the most prominent in his mind He told the Emperor that there was
a sacred place of the Jainas, Satiunjaya by name, in Saulāstra,43 to which Hira Sūrı
intended to go on a pilgrimage, and that a tax was levied from pilgrims to that holy place
He further said that he and the whole Jaina community would be highly obliged
of the Emperor kindly issued a filmān abolishing the tax Hearing this the Emperor told
Samsudin, 44 the eldest son of Khān Āzam that no tax was to be levied from either
the revered Ācārya Hīra-Vijaya Sūrı or from any member of the Jaina laity when
42 Pīra-Panjāla _"Kāsmır is encompassed on all sides by the Himālayan ranges Twenty six
different roads lead from it to Hindustān, but of these, those by Bhimbhar, (Chibhān) and
Pakli are the best and can generally be travelled through on horse-back The former is
the shortest and it has several routes of which three are good (1) Hastı Bhanj (Hastı
Watar) which was the former route for the march of the troops, (2) Pır Panjāl which his
Majesty thrice traversed on his way to the rose garden of Kāsmir If on these hills an ox or
a horse be killed, storm clouds and wind arise together with snowfall and rain, and (3) Tang

“Pir Panjäl has come to mean the pass of the Great Range, Panjäl being applied to a great
Moutain Ridge”
The Ratnapanjāl may be another name of either Hastıbhanj or of Tangtalah, or it may be
the name of an altogether different route

they visited Šatı unjaya. He further ordered him to inform his father, the then Governor
of Gujarāt, of this royal order, by a written order and hand it over to Bhānucandra,
“the best of the ascetics”. So saying the Emperor at once repaired to his harem.
In accordance with the royal wish an order was given to the master, who at once
despatched it to his guru Hira-Vijaya Sūri (44)
The Kharatara Jainases were overwhelmed with jealousy at this achievement
of the Upādhyāya They approached the Emperor and made humble entreaties to him
to the effect that the Satıunjaya Hills should be made over to them as they were
whole-heartedly devoted to his welfare and blessed him. Thereupon the Emperor asked
them where the Hill was situated At this very moment the Saikh made an inadvertent
remark that the tax levied there brought a good slice of revenue to the treasury.
The Emperor on hearing this, ordered that no tax should be levied from any monk,
who went as a pilgrim there After that he retired to his seraglio From that time
onwards, the master (Bhānucandıa), more determined than ever to secure the Hill for his
group, launched on the programme of propitiating the Saikh with a view to convert him
to his way of thinking about the Hill ( 48).
In Kāśmīra there is a large lake named Jaina Lankā4 extending over some
55 Kosas Desilous of visiting it, the Emperor accompanied by feudatory chiefs and
45 The Kharataras vere with Akbar when he went to Kāsmīr This is supported by the
Kharatara books Samayasundara a Jaina monk belonging to this group, says in the
beginning of his Astalaksı that Akbar started for Kāsmíra from Lāhore on Śrāvana śukla 13,
S. Y, 1649 (Thursday 10th August 1592), and first halted at Rāmdāsa Garden at Lahore
From "Karmacandra Vans'otkārtanakam-Kävyam" Verses 408 etc, we find that Mānasimha
and Dungara alias Harsa-Viśāla (monks of the Kharatara group) accompanied the Emperor
to Kāsmīr and that before Akbar arrived at Rohitās, he asked Karmacandra to guard his
seraglio, and he returned from Kāsmīr to Lāhore (on 29-12-1592 A. D. corresponding with
Friday Paosa Sukla S Y. 1649)
46 Jaina Lankā -Zain Lanka "His Majesty, determined on his return, on 20th of Aban,
(1st November 1592 A D ) set out in a boat, committing the government again to the care
of Yusuf Mirza Rawası On his return journey, a reservoir named Zain Lanka was visited
by him Together with some incidents that took place after that, it is described by one of
the company--Nizamuddin Ahmed-as follows —"This reservoir is enclosed on the West,
North and South by mountains and it is 30 Kos-60 miles in circumference The river Bahat
(Jihlām) passes through this lake. Its water is very pure and deep Sultan Zainul Abidin
carried out a pier of stone to the distance of 180 feet into the lake and upon it erected a high
building Nothing like this lake and building is to be found in India After visiting
this edifice, he ( Akbar) went to Barahmulah, where he disembarked and proceeded by land
to Pakhlı At Pakhlı the Emperor was detained nearly a month by the snows and rains.
He subsequently made a stay of thirteen days in Rohtās, left it on 9th December and arrived
at Lāhore about 29th December 1592” (Noer Vol II, P 225-6 ) See also Elliot's History of
India Vol V P 465.
Abul Fazl, while describing the third visit in 1597 A D refers to Jain Lanka —“On the 6th
he went to Sıhabuddinpur and from there he proceeded to Jain Lanka When he came to
the lake, there were high waves, the boat was taken to the bank, and he rested by the skirt of
the mountain on the 20th, he started in a vessel prepared for him, and witnessed
the spectacle of the river Behat (Jhelam)". Akbarnāmā Vol III, p 1088.

by the guru ( Bhānucandra) started towards it in a boat The rest of his army walked
by the road along the bank After some days the Emperor reached Jaina Lankā.
The climate of the whole region is cool and agreeable and it abounds in lotuses of
Tariegated colours. During the Emperor's stay, there was plenty of rainfall in those parts.
A cold wave passed through the whole region and the Emperor and the whole of his army
had a hard time fight with exeessive snow and biting winds. The Emperor, shivering with
cold though stuffed with rich woolen gain, was shocked at the thought of the plight of
the ascetics whom their religious tenets forbade to put on any thing more than only
a limited measure of cloth, in all climates He and his retinue retired to the inner
chamber where they all tasted the juices of various kinds of fruits Next morning,
when he saw the guru almost blanched with cold, he made a friendly joke at him
to the effect that while others obtained the taste of fruits, he obtained the taste of cold.
After the recital of the names of the Sun was nver, the Guru, always intent upon
achieving his desired object-the possession of the Satrunjaya Hill by his group-perceiving
that the Emperor was in a happy frame of mind, gently observed that while His Majesty
had satisfied the desires of all who solicited him, he was not granted the same favour.
The Emperor immediately requested him to speak his mind frankly, assuring him that
he would do all in his power to satisfy him The Guru, who had renounced all
worldly happiness and gratification of any desile i esulting merely in his own happiness,
at once put it to him that the tax levied from pilgrims visiting the Satrunjaya Hill,
be abolished. The Emperor ieplied that it had been reported to him that the tax formed
a good avenue of income to the royal treasury. The Guru argued that, the income,
he was quite sure, could not be more than a drop in the ocean of the revenues of his
colossal empire The Emperor smiled an understanding smile, and instructed Abul Fazl
to piepare a firmān abolishing the tax on that holy place and to hand it over to the guru.
The firmān was immediately penned by the S'arhh At the request of the guru, it was
made in favour of Hira-Vijaya Sūri. The Emperoi put his seal upon it and handed it
over to the guru who requested the Emperor to get it dispatched to Hila-Vijaya Sūri.
Thus the guru achieved permanent glory47. Hira Sūri after receiving the firmāns,
started on a pilgrimage to the holy place with Jaina congregations from many countries*'.
From that time onwards, all pilgrims to Mount Siddha-Satıunjaya-enjoy immunity from
the pilgrim-tax (71).
Then the Emperor and his retinue started back by boats After visiting Kāśmīra
and Kedāra, he reached the foot of Rohitās. After a continuous march, during which he

impressed the people highly with his powerful personality and greatness, he reached
Lābhapura (Lāhore ) 50 (75)
A brave warrior and a wise general and statesman, Akbar subjugated almost
the whole of India, and became Emperor in name and in deed (76)
The third prakāsdealing with Akbai's visit to Kāśmīra and the freedom of
Šatrunjaya from pilgrim-tax ends here.
Fourth Chapter -One day, the Emperor called to his Court a leading Jaina
gentleman, Durjanaśalya" by name, and asked him whom Hīra Sūnı had appointed as his
successor. He replied that a great and austere ascetic named Vijayasena Sūri was selected
as his successor by Hira Sūri. On hearing this, the Emperor issued a firmān inviting
Vijayasena Sūri to present himself at the Court and handed it over to Bhānucandra.
When Vijayasena Sūri received the royal firmāno?, he immediately started for Lāhore,
together with a batch of one hundied disciples. (8).
At each village on his way, he was received with great jubilation by the Jaina laity
who listened to his sermons with rapt attention and fervent devotion. After some days
he reached the out-skirts of Lābhapura (Lāhore) As ordered by Suratrāna (Sultān 1. e.
Akbar), Bhānucandra Vācaka (Upādhyāya) accompanied by the Saikh and the imperial
army went forth to ieceive him in the city 83 (15)
Then Bhānucandra escorted the Sūri to the Emperor's presence, who was delighted
to have an interview with him He then repaired to his retieat in the city with gieat
festivities by the orders of the Emperor Vijayasena Sûri in company of the Vācaka
(Bhānucandra) paid several visits to the Emperor. On one of the occasions, one of his
disciples, Nandivijaya by name, performed avadhanas (attending to several subjects
at the same time) The Emperor, amazed at this, conferred on him the title
" Khus-faham” (a man of sharp intellect) (18).

The Brāhmins felt very jealous of the exalted position enjoyed by the Jaina
Acārya at the royal Court., So, they deputed Rāmadāsa Mahārāja54 to the presence
of the Emperor Rāmadāsa told the Emperor that the Sūri and his followers were
non-believers in Vedas, non-worshippers of God, and that they could not bow even to him.
On healing this, the Sultan, his eyes ablaze with anger, called the Sūri, enumerated
the imputations to him, and demanded an explanation The Sūri replied calmly that they
believed in every thing and that the Brāhmins had huiled those charges against him
and his followers out of jealousy The Emperor conveyed this explanation to
Bhattācārya-a brāhmin Ācārya-who told the Emperor that the Jaina Ācārya had said
those things because he feared to incur the royal wrath, but that nothing of the kind was
enjoined in his scriptures. Thereupon the Emperor asked the Saikh, who was standing
near him, to find out the truth The Saikh arranged a debate in the assembly-hall,
and asked the Sūri to prove the truth of his assertions and to convince him and
the Biābmanas about them (Details about the discussion are given in verses 27 to 41 ).
In brief, the Sūri explained that the whole world was subject to the inexorable law of
Karma, and that those who attained omniscience and final beatitude were not subjected to
physical embodiment He further said that the idea of God as expounded in Samkhya
was the same Bhattācārya and his band felt trounced, and the Saikh fully convinced
and highly impressed, approached the Emperol and told him that the explanation of
the Jaina Ācārya was quite satisfactory and in complete harmony with what was stated
in his scriptures. Then the Sūri was taken to his upāsraya in a large procession and his
fame was greatly enhanced (47)

Rāmadāsa accompanied him and is there stated to be a patron of Brāhmins who were
presented with gifts by Akbar at his instance –

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
Once upon a time, the Empezoi greeted the Sūrı with affection, and said
“Some time ago, Hira-Vijaya Sûri complied with my request to confer the title
- Upadhyāya" on Bhānucandra. Now, I request you to porform the nandı (auspicious)
ceremony in connection with the said title of Upādhyāya He then instructed the Saikh
to accompany the Sūri to the pratis'raya (the Jaina monks' halting-place) for
the purpose The Sūri unhesitatingly consented to do the Emperor's wish, and in
company with the Saikh and his retinue, repaired to the pratis'raya. The Saikh
celebrated the investiture ceremony with festivities on the grandest scale i e. with
the princes, multitude of elephants, horses, musical instruments and imperial bands.
Rich and leading Jainas like Sthānasimha walked with the Minister The Sūri then
performed the investiture ceremony with great pleasure He also conferred “ Vardhamāna
Vidyā” (a mantra sacred to Lord Vardhamāna having as its presiding deity a goddess,
by which the spiritual powers of the Guru are conferred) on Bhānucandra Women sang
joyful songs The Saikh gave in charity 108 horses and personally distributed cocoanuts
with silver coins, among those who had come to attend the ceremny Banıās showered
gold coins. The Sūri was granted an imperial firmān prohibiting slaughter of cows,
buffaloes and other animals. Then he secured the royal permission to start for Gujarat,
and leaving Nandivijaya at the Court, departed (67)
It often crossed the mind of Hira Sūri that there were not enough of his pupils
at Lāhoie to preach and to spread the Jaina gospel there. So he sent two of his best
pupils there-Bhāvacandra and Siddhicandra (the author of the present work )-both of
whom were blood brothers and were recently initiated. The former of the two had made
himself wellknown by his great services to his guru The latter had won a high name for
himself by bis wealth of learning combined with a charming personality. He was
as handsome as the God of love and was endowed with strıking qualities of head and heart
He grew like a Kalparrhsa watered with nectar poured out of jars in the form of popular
eyes All the arts vied with one another in being mastered by him. His genius was of
an outstanding character. His was a comprehensive mind match for grasping,
grappling with, and solving any intellectual conundrum In intellectual sharpness
he surpassed Abhaya and Rohāó (74)
Once upon a time the Emperor's eyes met those of Siddhicandra who had
approached him out of curiosity. The Emperor felt that standing before his eyes was the
God of Love incarnate, who had taken the form of an ascetic in order to be free for ever
from the pangs of birth and rebirth. So much was he struck by the matchless beauty of
Siddhicandra that for a moment he forgot everything around him including the Master and
even himself, and simply marvelled at the shapely form of the young ascetic. Then rousing
himself out of his stupor with an effort, he inquired of the Master who that ascetic was.
The Master replied, "by nature courteous, and attached like a bee to a jasmine flower,
to the science of eight avadhānas, (paying attention to eight things at the same time),
he is my pupil, Siddhicandra by name, who has entered our Holy Order after having
56 Abhaya-son and intelligent Minister of King Śrenika of Magadha in the times of Lord,
Mahāvira Rohā-a genius described in Jaina folk-lore.

renounced the world, and who has recently come here from Gurjaratrā (Gujarāt)"
The Emperor still with his mind full of amazement at the matchless handsomeness
of the young ascetic, called him just in front of him to let his eyes have their fill.
Then he summoned him to the inner Court, and in the presence of all kings, asked him
to perform his feat of avadhānas The Emperor was wonder-struck at his incomparable
mastery over arts and conferred on him the well-known title " Khus-Faham" (a man of
sharp intellect). Then he cheerfully asked him to permanently stay there and there alone,
with his sons ( 86 ).
Siddhicandra used to visit the harem-the seraglio-sometimes by invitation of
the Emperor and sometimes of his own accord. There he read voraciously and made
himself within a very short time master of almost all branches of knowledge-various
treatises on grammar like Mahābhāsya (by Patanjalı), poems like Narsadha (by Šrī
Harsa), works on logic like Cintāmaņi (Tatva-C'intāmuni by Ganges'a Upādhyāya)
on rhetoric like Kavya-prahāsa (by Mammatācārya) and on prosody and on various forms
of dramaturgy. Then, prompted by the Emperor he studied the Persian language and
then dived deep into that literatures About this time, Nandivijaya having secured
the royal permission, departed for Gujalāt in order to attend upon Hira Sūri (92)
About this time Hīra Vijaya Sūrı died. When the Emperor heard this sad piece
of news, he became exceedingly dejected and with tears in his eyes, inquired of
the Upādhyāya at what place Hira Sūrı had attained divinity (died) The Upādhyāya,
also full of sorrow, replied that in Saurastra, there was a port Dvīpa (Div) by name near
which there was a nice village named Unā, it was there that the great man had attained
nirvāna. The ciemation ceremony was performed in an oart of that village. He further
said that a miracle happened at the time The moment the smoke, that issued forth from
the burning body below, came into contact with the mango-trees above, they all bore fruit
though it was not yet the proper time for them to do so. He then requested His Majesty
to grant to the Jaina community a piece of land there, so that a strīpa (monument
in the form of a Tope) might be erected there to commemorate the name of the revered
monk. The Emperor granted ten bighas for the purpose. A document to that effect was
prepared, and the Upādhyāya despatched it through his brother Rangacandra. The local
Sangha (congregation ) then erected a stūpass4 which appeared as if it were a heavenly
vimāna, and thus evinced their intense devotion for the Acārya (101).

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
After some time, the Emperor felt a desire to visit Kāśmīra again in order to enjoy
the sight of flowers in full bloom there So, he set out for Srīnagara. Both the
Upādhyāya and Siddhicandra accompanied him Siddhicandra used to read Persian books
to his giandsons and read out what was taught the previous day the next morning
to the Emperor He was very useful and serviceable to the kind Emperor also.
And thus his fame spread everywhere After crossing Mounts Ratna-Panjāla, Pira-
Panjāla, and others, which had snow-clad snmmits, the Emperor reached Kāśmīra
He enjoyed there the sight of trees studded with scented and full-blown flowers.
He stayed there for a few months, and visited all the places there, noted for their
wonderful beauty of scenery Then he returned to Lābhapura (Lāhore) (108)
The Emperor was much attached to deer-hunting On one occasion, while on
a hunting expedition, he was so seriously wounded by the deer which gored its pointed
horn into his body, that he fainted on the spot. He was confined to bed in his harem for
fifty daysør. During these days he suffered from intense and acute pain on account of
the wound During these days, nobody except Upadhyāya Bhānucandra and Sri Saikh
(Abul Fazl) both of whom enjoyed the Emperor's full confidence, was allowed to go near
himei On account of much merit acquired in his former life, the Emperor recovered
as if to do still more meritorious deeds Immediately after his recovery, he sent
five hundied cows to the halting place of the Jaina monks, for the purpose of destributing
them in charity The Upādhyāya asked the leading members of the community
to distribute those cows among the Brāhmins of the city, and thus kept his glory gieen in
the city till now (113)

Emperor this time returned to Lahore exactly after six months in November Akbar fell ill
and was nursed by his friend (Xavier) who was allowed to enter his bed-room, a privilege
not conceded to the greatest viceroys in the Empire The mountain roads, even after
Kāsim Khān's improvements, were in such bad condition, that many elephants, horses and
servants perished during the return journey”p 259 V Smith "Akbar". (1st Edition)

one month and twenty two days
Zabdatu-t-tawārıkh also states –In this year (1004 H ) also the king, while witnessing
an antelope-fight was wounded in the thigh by one of their horns, which penetrated very
deep Great alarm was felt throughout the country, but after retiring for a few days
to the inner apartments, and seating himself on the carpet of affliction, he recovered,
by the blessing of God and restored comfort to the hearts of all the world.”_Elliot's History

INTRODUCTION
One day the Emperor, accompanied by feudatory chiefs, elephant-army and cavalı yı
camped at Ugrasenapura (Agrā) Bhānucandra and Siddhicandra also were with
the Emperor The former was teaching the Emperor's sons, while the latter at the desire
of the Emperor brought up and bred up his grandsons The Emperor's respect and love
for Siddhicandra grew to a very great extent At Āgrā, some non-Jainas piejudiced
the mind of the Emperor against the Jainas, and consequently, the Emperoi issued
an Order stopping the erection of a new Jaina temple there dedicated to Cintāman,
(Pārsvanātha )62 The erection of the temple had already begun and it was nearly
half-completed Then Siddhicandia, by his personal influence over the Emperor,
got the order cancelled and obtained the Emperor's sanction to go on with the work of
building the temple, which was then completed within a short time (118)
Almost at this time the Kharatara Jainas insolently began the erection of a temple
in the interior part of the principal temple precincts, on Mount Vemalācala (Satrunjaya)
in Saurāstra On this point, there arose a quarrel between them and the “i espectable"
members of the Tapā group, who took objection to it Remembering the words of the wise
that even at the cost of delaying the accomplishment of one's own object, efforts should be
made to put a stop to the evil about to be inflicted by the enemy, the Upādhyāya
obtained from the Emperor a firmān forbidding the erection of the new temple on
the Mount (122)
Then the Emperor started on a military expedition to the Southez, to subjugate
some rebellious kings there, with his fourfold army On his ways, he camped at the famous
fort of Gopacala (Gwalior )64 famous for its invulnerability. There he found lacs of
Jaina idols, carved in ancient times by the orders of some Jaina king, on the mountain
well The Emperor saw that they were deformed by some wicked persons His sense of
piety and purity revolted at the sight and he said to the Upādhyāya that to a man
who would put those idols cleverly in their proper order, he would give as much wealth
as he desired from the royal treasury Hearing this frank and sincere declaration of
His Majesty, which showed the nobility of his nature, the Upādhyāya pointed to him
a Jaina who was competent for that task That Jaina achieved the desired object
in a short time by means of the Emperor's monies Then the Emperor set out and
62 Originally the idol of Cintāmanı (Pārs'vanātha ) was installed and consecrated in the former
temple at Āgrā, by Hira-Vijaya Sūri in s Y. 1640 Vide Hīra-Saubhagya-Kavya Ch 14
Verse 152
63 From Akbarnāmā Vol III, we can trace that on 26th Aban (about 6-11-1598 A D.)
Thursday, Akbar marched from Lāhore by the route of Agrā which he reached after 2 months
and 2 days and from where he on the 6th Mıhır (16–9–1599 A D) went off on expedition to
the Deccan The line of his march lay by Dholpur (on 5th Aban), Gwalior (20th Āban-
1-11-1599 A D), Bhilsā ( 27th Azar), Sujāwalpur, Ujjain (about 15th Bahman), route of
Dipālpur and Dhār, Bijāgarha and Burhānpur (on 21st Isfandārmaz-31-3-1600 AD)
Thus from Āgrā to Buhrānpur, 195 days were taken
64 Gwalior—"Gwālior is under the Subah of Agrā It is a famous fortress, and an elephant
carved in stone at its gate fills the beholder with astonishment It contains some stately
edifices of its former rulers Its climate is good It has always been noted for its exquisite
singers and lovely women. Here is an iron mine,"-P. 181 Aine Akbarı Vol 11. Jarrett,

conquering all the countries on his way, reached Barhānapuia ( Burhānpur )65. Next he
conquered the fort named Asera ( Āsirgaiha), and ordering his main army to march on,
stayed there for some days. The learned Upādhyāya who was teaching his sons,
also stayed there with Siddhicandra All the Deccan kings who possessed large forts®
were vanquished by the Emperor's armyor.

67 Akbar's prolonged residence in the Punjāb, extending over thirteen years, had been largely
due to his fears of an Uzbeg invasion (p 270) The news of Abdullā Khān Uzbeg's death
received in 1598 freed the Emperor from all fear of a Tartar invasion, and left him
at liberty to supervise the doings of his sons, and to take measures for the effective
prosecution of the campaign in the Deccan, which obviously needed the master's eye Akbar
accordingly decided to proceed to the South in person. He left Lāhore late in 1598 for
Āgrā, which he now treated as his capital He was obliged to stay there for several months
in order to deal with the difficulties caused by the insubordinate conduct of his sons
In July 1599 (beginning of A. H 1008) he felt himself at liberty to resume his progress
southwards In May 1599 Prince Murād died at a town in the Deccan At about the
middle of the same year, Akbar crossed (p 271) the Narbadā and occupied Burhānpur
(capital of Khāndesh) without opposition Ahmednagar was stormed without much difficulty
in August 1600. Asırgarh a very strong fort reckoned to be onə of the wonders of the
world in the sixteenth century (p 272) surrendered to Akbar in January 1601 Then
the attitude of Prince Salım rendered absolutely necessary the return of the Emperor to his
capital if he wished to retain his crown, treasures and life, which were all threatened by
the ungrateful and undutiful conduct of his first-born son, the well-beloved Shaikhu Bābā, the
child of many prayers Akbar marched in April for Agră, where he soon arrived, probably
sarly in May 1601. p. 287, V. Smath's 'Akbar'. (First Edition)

INTRODUCTION.
Once upon a time the guru (Bhānucandra) who had been previously urged by
the local Jaina congregation, made a request to the Emperor, after the religious discussion
with him was over He said that Barhānapuia was a flourishing town, and that there were
thousands of giand mansions and business-magnates there He further pointed out that
it contained temples and worshipping-places for the followers of all religions except for
those of Jainism. The Emperor then enquned of him the reason why it was so there.
The guru replied that it had come about as a result of a prohibitory order by the Anāryas.
He also said that a temple had been formerly built there, but that it was demolished
by wicked persons later on The Emperor was sorry to learn this and desired that
the city might be adorned with many temples. He summoned his officers and some
leading members of the Jaina community to his presence and gave them an order to erect
several temples there. Bowing gratefully to the stern Emperor, they very soon got busy
with the task, and in a short time several temples and upāsrayas were erected.
A Śrimālı Jaina, Ajaya( Jaya Jrāj by name, got a pratisraya (a halting-place for Jaina
monks) built in Kansāra-Pātaka (Kansārāpādā--the locality of Copper-smiths). In its
vicinity, the president of the congregation, Rikhu by name got a temple built dedicated
to Bhidabhanjana Pārsvanātha. Behind it, Durjanaśalya ( of Lahore already referred to at
page 38 f. n. no. 51), a Jaina gentleman respected by the Emperor as if he was a minister,
got a high-domed temple erected, and got installed in it by the Upādhyāya an idol of
Saiveya (son of Śivā 1. e. Neminātha) as principal deity, which was brought from
Ramer (Amer in Jaipur State) In the same locality another temple was built by
a Jaina lady named Gauri. An upāsraya was built by another lady. Thus, thanks
to the efforts of the Upādhyāya for the enhancement of the glory of Jainism, numerous
temples and upāsrayas were erected in Barhānapura where for merly they were conspicuous
by their absence. They are still extant there as monuments to the Master's glory,69 (147).
Then the Emperor departed from the place. The Upādhyāya stayed on there on
account of his indifferent health Accompanied by Siddhicandia, whom the Emperor,
out of respect and love, always kept by his side, the Emperor reached Agrã after
some time. During his stay there, Siddhicandra always spared no pains to enhance
the glory of Jainism and virtually controlled the religious policy of the Emperor (150).
68 In Vegaya-Tilaka Sūrz Rāsa we find Burhānpur, as the centre of Bhānucandra's activities in
Jahăngir's times too, which we shall see after the Summary of this work is over The said
rāsa also was composed by Dars'anavijaya at Burhānpur in the temple of Manamohana
Pars'vanatha
69 As to Bhāpucandra's visit of Burhānpur with Akbar, seo Hira Sūri Rāsa p 184 verses 4 to 7,
wherein it is stated "Bhānucandra saved the town from being raided and looted by
the Imperial army. He saved a local leading man by name Bhojarāja Soni, who with
his family was imprisoned by Akbar and was sentenced to death, on getting him to pay
ransom to the Emperor Further he initiated ten pupıls in his order and got ten temples
construced there" The big temple was dedicated to Manamohan Pārsvanatha as mentioned
by Dars'ana-vijaya in the colophon of two Adhikāras of Vijaya-telaka Sūri Rūsa in S Y 1679
and 1697 The idols of that God, Cintāmanı Pārs'vanātha, Mahāvira, śāntinātha, Nominātha,
Supārs'yanātha, Godi-Pārs'vanātha are mentioned to be extant before S. Y. 1732 in
Šilavijaya's Tirthamāla of S. Y, 1748 published in Prācīna Tirthamālā Sangraha, p. 113.

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
In Saurāstia, Khuram”, the son of Aziz Kokā, demolished a Jaina temple which
stood at the foot of Mount Vimala (Satrunjaya), some wicked people surrounded
the piincipal temple also, which was built on the hill—and heaped wood-sticks on all sides
in order to buin it. A messenger, with a letter from Sri Vijaya-Sena Sūri, was hurried
to Siddhicandra When the latter read the contents of the letter, he at once approached
the Emperor and acquainted him with the state of affairs Thereupon the Emperor
gianted him a loyal firmān prohibiting the outrageous activity referred to above.
The fir mān was immediately despatched, and thus a grave calamity which was about
to befall the principal temple on Mt. Satrunjaya, was averted by Siddhicandra, the only
hiave man capable of achieving much things for the protection of the Tirtha (157).
Once upon a time the Emperor, remembering the great love he had for
the Upādhyāja (Bhānucandra), wiote a letter to him, in which he said that
the Upādhyāya might be affectionately remembering him, while he was unable to do so
because his heart, the function of which was to remember, had been taken away by His
Holiness with him On receiving this letter, which expressed the Emperor's love for him,
and which was couched in affectionate terms tinged with delicate humour, the Upādhyāya,
at once went to the royal Court and saw the Emperor, who warmly embraced him and
elated with joy requested him to teach his grandsons and to continue visiting the Court
frequently as he used to do before (162)
cx
By this time a letter from Vijaya-Sena Sūri was received. In it he stated that on
account of a prohibitory order issued by the Emperor some time ago, no new temple was
being built on the Satrunjaya Hill, workmen could not proceed with the work. He
further pointed out that if that state of affairs continued for a long time, the Hill,
as the most sacred place of the Jainas, would have little significance in course of time,
because, the old temples would some day, on account of wear and tear and other
inclemancies of weather, crumble down, and there would be no new temples to replace
them. Bbānucandra and Siddhicandıa forthwith approached the Emperor and requested
him to repeal the order The Emperor complied with their request and issued an order
allowing the erection of new temples on the Hill. Consequently, many temples were from
that time erected there, which still bear an eloquent testimony to the efforts of these
two-Master and pupil-to enhance the glory of the Faithal (167).
Then Gujarāt came under the sway of Prince Salım, the eldest son of the Emperor
Akbar. He appointed Viceroys over it Akbar did not interfere with what his viceroys
70 Mirzā Khurrum-(No 163, Aını Akbarı Vol I) 3rd son of Azimkhāna Āziz Kokā (No 21,
See f n no 34 in the introduction p 29). He was appointed governor-Fouzdār-of
Junāgarh-Saurāstra by Akbar, and as such is referred to in Vyaya-pras'asti-Kavya XX,
verse 57.

beginning with a festen Appendıx I.

INTRODUCTION
did there. Consequently, difficulties al ose in connection with the execution of the orders
(issued formerly by the Emperor Akbal) prohibiting animal-slaughter and other religious
things. When Siddhicandra ieceived news to this effect from Gujarāt, he approached
the Emperor and in gentle terms brought it to his notice that the Viceroys of Gujarāt
wele ciuelly oppressing the people there by reviving the animal-slaughter, Jazia":
and many other taxes. On hearing this, the Emperol became sorry and gave him,
a written order prohibiting all such outi ages The people of Gujalāt were thus relieved of
then acute distress by the noble efforts of Siddhicandra? (173)
After some time, the Emperor died?4 while he was alone Salim was annointed on
the throne by the Ministers He abolished many taxes and ruled the country as
a father would rule his child No enemy could resist him. His mandates were implicitly
obeyed in all the countries, though over some of them were ruling kings with full sovereign
rights These kings always obeyed his orders. Jahāngu enjoyed and amused himself
as Indra does in heaven-sometimes residing in wonderful rest-houses, sometimes
on the banks of the Indus, sometimes on pleasuie-mounts, sometimes in mansions
of variegated colours, sometimes ravelling in the exquisite performance of the best feinale
dancers, sometimes listening to the soft music of beautiful damsels, and sometimes
attending to dramatic performances (181)
Now, Bhānucandra accompanied with Siddhicandia, after a continuous stay
at the royal Court for 23 years, secured Jahāngir's permission to deparù foi Gujarāt.
Receiving high honours from Jaina congregations and from ruling chiefs on the way,
72 Jazyāh was abolished by previous imperial firmāns —"In the beginning of the (9th year)
11-3-1564 A D one of the greatest gifts which His Majesty (Sahins'ah) made yas the
abolishment of the Jazyā throughout India" Akbarnāmā Vol II P 316
“In this year (H 967, 1579 A D ) the Tamgha (inland tolls) and the Jazyāh (tax levied
for the infidels) which brought in several crores of dams to the treasury were abolished and
orders to this effect were circulated through the whole empire” Aine Akbarı I, p 189.
73 At this time when Akbai was in Deccan, Salım had revolted He entrenched himself within
the strong fort of Allahābād, built by Akbar, extended his rule over part of Bihar,
aud assumed the insignia of independence On Akbar's return to Āgrā in the middle of

the governorship of Bengal and Orissa Again he assumed the title of a King, though still

"He was, in the beginning of Akbar's reign, accountant of the elephant stables, and held
the title of Rāı Rāyan He distinguished himself in the senge of Chitor and rendered
good services in Bengal, and in defeating Bir Singh, the murderer of Abul Fazal. Akbar,
at last, in the 48th year, called him to Court and made him in the next year commander
of 5000, and gave him the title “Rājah Bikramājit” After Jahāngir's accession, when
the sons of Muzuffar of Gujarāt created disturbance and Yātım Bahādur had been killed,
Patr was sent to Ahmedābād, with powers to appoint the officers of rebels who submitted
upto the commands of Yuzbashıs or recommend them, if they held higher commands,
fot appointments, to the Emperor”.

"To Patr Dās, who in the time of my father, had title of Rāi Rāyān, I gave the title of
Rājā Bikramăjit. The latter was one of the great Rājās of India, and it was in his reign
that astronomical observations were established in India I made, Patr Dās, Master of
Ordinance, and ordered that he should always have light artillery in the Arsenal, 50000 light
guns and 3000 gun-carriages, ready and in efficient order He was a Khatri by.caste and
rose in my father's service from being accountant of the elephants' stables to bo Diwan and
an Amir He is not wanting in Military qualities and in administrative skill" At pages
49-50, he further states "At the beginning of my reign, a son of that Muzaffar Gujarātı who
claimed to be descended from the rulers of that country lifted up the head of disturbance
and attacked and plundered the environs of the city of Ahmadābād Some-sardars such
as Pim Bahādur Uzbeg and Rãy Ali Bhati, who were amongst the distinguished and
brave men there, became martyrs in that outbreak At length Rājā Bikramăjit and many
mansabdars were provided by me with 6000 or 7000 horse and appointed to assist the army
of Gujarāt It was decided that when things had quieted down, by the driving off of those
seditious people, Rājā Bikramājit should be Subahdar of Gujarāt Qılīj Khān, who had been
previously nominated to this office, should come to Court After the arrival of the royal

accompanied by Siddhicandra, performed, with great pomp, the worship of God Jina,
and issued a proclamation, by the beating of drums, prohibiting animal-slaughter
throughout the country. Thereafter by the order of the Master (Vijayasena Sūri),
the Upādhyāya passed the monsoon at Mahiśānapura (Mehsānā) and then came
to Pattana (Pātān). (187)
At Pātan, the Kharataras, being jealous of the high position enjoyed by
Vijayadeva Sūrı( of Tapā Gaccha), conspired with many Sūris of other Gacchas,
and with pretentions of great learning, decided to hold a debate with him Accordingly,
accompanied by their followers, they repaired to the principal gate of the fort, and stood
there challenging the Sūri to an open debate. The Surı, hearing that, came to the gate
together with Siddhicandra whom he considered to be a match for them. Then he asked
Siddhicandra to hold a debate with those insolent opponents. Hammering arguments
upon arguments in a perfectly logical order, Siddhicandia vanquished them, one and all,
who, condemned fiercely by the audience that had gathered around, left the place with
down-cast eyes The Sūri returned to his halting place amidst gieat rejoicing (195)
After some days, a Jaina lady named Lāl178 installed the idol of Tirthanhara.
The Occasion was celebrated with festivities on a very grand scale. Jaina congregations
from all towns and villages, flocked to Pātan, which extensive though it was, proved not
spacious enough to have enough space for the swarming thousands While, however,
the galayāti āto procession was in progress, an order, prohibiting the ceremony, was issued
whose appointment is mentioned, does not seem actually to have taken charge of Gujarāt)”,
but this inference made from the statements in the Memoirs of Jahāngır Vol I, P 50
is not true He did go and, taking charge of Ahmedābād, restored order as is borne out
by this work,
This Bikramājit cannot be identified with Kunrapāla or his brother Sonapāla, the two

by the Governoi, Sādullāso by name. A wave of grief overwhelmed the crowd,
which a moment ago was in high spirits. All activities came to a sudden stop and
none knew what to do A deputation consisting of the leading members of the
congregation waited upon the Governor, but they were rudely insulted by him.
At last, the Sūrı asked the Upādhyāya (Bhānucandra) to set the matter right by
approaching the Governor. At that time, however, Siddhicandra approached the Sūrı
and told him that there was no need for the Upādhyāya to take any trouble, as he himself
would approach the Governor and see the thing through. Pleased at this offer, the Sūri
permitted him to do so. Accompanied by the leading members of the congregation,
Siddhicandra confidently went to the residence of Mirza Sādullā, the governor, and
requested him to tell him the reason why the performance of a good and harmless
ceremony was prohibited by him. He also warned him that such an attitude on his part
would mean the end of all relationship between them. On hearing this reprimand,
the Governor felt ashamed and inquired of Siddhicandra what he should do to please him.
The latter asked him to accompany him to the upās'raya, see his Master there, and
to receive a cocoanut twice while attending the gala-yātrā mahotsava. The governor
complied with his request Thus triumphed the good over the wicked who meant
trouble. Then the Upādhyāya, having passed monsoons at Vatapadra (Baroda) and
Gandbāra8halted at Pātan during the next monsoon. (209)

thereafter further dignified himat the time of his visīt to Gujarāt with the appellation of
“Nawazish Khān” (Tuzuk-1-Jahăngırı P 73, 183 and 197) He was, it appears, Fouzdār of

Sarkārs, which correspond to the modern districts The officer who exercised civil and
military jurisdiction over the Sarkar went by the name of Fouzdār, and answered to the

to the effect that it was the Emperor's desire that Bhānucandra and Siddhicandra
should go to Agrā and see him. The governor, learning that they both were at Pātan,
sent his own body-guard, Mādhavadās by name83 to deliver to them the royal massage.
On hearing the message both came to Ahmedābād where they were respectfully received
by the Governor. Then they started on their long journey On then way they came
to Medinipura (Mertā) where they worshipped Pārśvānātha at Falavardhi (Falodhi).
At that place the Kharatara Ācāryas were plotting to have possession of that Tirtha,
with the help of the local ruler Bhānucandrā and Siddhicandra stayed there for five or
six days, secured possession of the Tirth for then own Tapā group, and then proceeded
further. At every place on their way they preached the gospel of their faith and
enhanced its glory At last they reached Agrā where a magnificent reception was
accorded to them. The Emperor, learning from Rāmadāsat that they both were waiting
gave it to Azam Khān, and it was settled that the latter should attend at Court, and that his
eldest son Jahāngır Kuli Khān should go to Gujarāt as his deputy The rank of Jahāngır
Kuli Khān was fixed at Rs 3,000 personal and 2,500 hoise An order was given that in
company with Mohan Dās Dīwān and Masud Beg Hamazāni Bakhshi, he should curry
on the business of the province Mohan Das was promoted to the rank of 800 with 500
horse, and Masud Beg to 300 with 150 horse” (Vol Ip 153)
I have in my possession an original partition deed of S Y 1667 Fālguna S'ukla 10th
Tuesday (12th February 1611 A D) executed at Ahmedābād wherein it is clearly stated
that Jahāngır-Kuli-Khān was the viceroy of Gujarăt in the words -

Bom Gaz History of Gujarāt, p 274 similarly says —"In A D 1609, the Khān 1-Āzam
Mirzā Āziz Kokaltāsh was for the fourth time appointed (12th) Viceroy of Gujarāt He
mas allowed to remain at Court and send his son (the said) Jahāngir Kulı Kbān as his
deputy with Mohandās Diwan and Masud Beg Hamadını. This was the beginning of
Government by Deputy, a custom which in later times was so injurious to the imperial
interests In 1611 A D Abdullā Khān Bahādur Fırāz Jang was appointed 13th Viceroy
of Gujarāt”
83 Madhavadāsa-Jahāngir Kuli Khān had Mohandas as Divān (Minister) as stated in
the above foot-note The said Mohandās may be the same as or different from Madhavadāsa
referred here who is stated to be Khān's body-guard
81 Rāmadāsa -See former foot-note No 54 p 39 Jahāngir states in his Tuzuk-1-Jahāngiri -
"I promoted Rāmdās Kachhwāha, whom my father had favoured, and who held the rank
of 2,000 to that of 3,000 (p 21) I also ordered Rāmdās Kachhwāha to receive a Jagır
in this (Savād-Swat Bajaur) province and to be enrolled among the auxıliaries of this
Subah (P 128) (In H 1020—about Bhādrapada S Y 1669 Hındı), as Abdullah Khăn
Bahādur Firuz-Jang had proposed to enter the neighbouring province of the Deccan by
way of Nāsık, it occurred to me to appoint Ramdās Kachhwāha, who was one of the sincere
servants of my revered father, to accompany him in order that he might in erery place look
after him and not allow him to be too rash and hasty For this purpose, I bestuwed on
him great favours, as well as the title of Rāj, which he had not thought of for himself

Once the Emperor (Jahāngir) affectionately said to the Upādhyāya _"Siddhi-
candra is endowed with good manners and physical beauty rarely found in others.
Please see that he comes to me every day at least for a short time" Accordingly
Siddhicandra used to visit the royal Court where the Emperor listened to his sermons
which impressed him very highly The Emperor declared to him that he would do
anything that he desired him to do. On account of these constant visits and the high
esteem in which he was held by the Emperor, Siddhicandra's fame spread everywherc.
The Emperor's attachment for him never slackened. Indeed, so much was his mind full
of thoughts about Siddhicandra, that he forgot even the royal elephants of which,
otherwise, he was extremely fond. The Monk also harboured much affection for His
Majesty. (227)
On one occasion, during their stay at Āgrā, Siddhicandra was delivering
an interesting lecture on the lives of the holiest saints. It was night time, and the moon
bad flooded the whole legion with her cool and fascinating rays (Next seven verses-228
to 234 ale devoted to the description of the rising moon). While the lecture was
going on, the Emperor, with something on his mind, put a question to Siddhicandra —
“How many years have elapsed since the bith of Your Holiness--you whose attachment
to Parabrahma (the highest spirit) is supreme?" The answer was, “Twenty five”. (236)

Once upon a time, the Empero185 looking at the physical handsomeness and
perfection of Siddhicandra, was stiuck with the thought that his position was similar
I also gave him Domms and the Fort of Ronthambúr which is one of the noted castles in
Hindustan and honouring him with superb robe of honour and an elephant and horse
I dismissed him'(P 201 & 202) He died iu H 1022 (1613 A, D., 1669-70 S Y ) See
Maāsırul-umrā I pp 335 to 338
85 Before we proceed with the incident as to what led Jahāngir to ask Siddhicandra to marry
a beautiful wife, it would be relevant to relate here that he supplied such a wife to his
English friend Hawkins -
“William Hawkins an English merchant presented himself to Jahāngir on April 16th
1609 A D at Agrā The King was pleased to see him, He liked new acquaintances,
especially good fellows who could hold their liquor, and Hawkins entertained him vastly
with stories of his travels Jahāngır gave his friend (Hawkins) a wife out of
the Royal Harem to cook his food This lady was a daughter of Mubārık Shāh,
an Armenian Christian who had risen to distinction in Akbar's service Jahangir
in an outburst of friendship, went so far as to offer him, if he would stay at the Court,
a pension of £ 3,200 a year, a troop of horse, and any concessions for the (English)
Factory that he liked to ask! He cheerfully acquieced His triumph, however,
was destined to be short-lived He left Āgrā in November 1611 A. D' Rawlinson's

to that of a male cuckoo cooing on the mango tree in a forest in the form of religious
austerities. So he called him to his side and said, “O Lord! you form is stately enough
to make you a king You have youth hotly in your veins Your age is meant for
the soft pleasure of contact with the body of red-blooded damsels Why, then, do you
waste it upon the desert of severe austenities 2"
In a rich and strident voice, the sage replied “Initiation into monkhood at a
tender age is neither funny nor foolish In the drinking of nectar, the wise never wait.
Which age is more suited to austerities-youth or old age2 Death lays his icy hands on
the young and the old alike o King' in old age a man has no resisting power-no
vitality, without which, no austerities can be performed It is, therefore, nothing more
than a delusion to think that old age is the only and the most proper time for
renouncing the world for the pui pose of achieving the noble aim of spiritual liberation
and perfection. In old age, the per formance of things requiring vitality results into
the dullness of intellect and nervous breakdown, Religious austerity is a sword that
kılls all the enemies in the form of wicked actions perpetrated by a man in his
countless previous births as well as in his present birth He who takes to this
course of life is respected by all as a man of courage Like the Sun it grants the
lustre-purity to his eyes, and gives him enough light in the form of knowledge and
conviction to enable him to distinguish between the real and the shadowy,-the material
and the immaterial.” (246)
The Emperor, with his eyes rolling unsteadily on account of the influence of drink,
asked him rather snappily -"How do you manage to keep your mind firm at an age
when it is exceedingly prone to be assailed constantly by the God of Love 2"
“By means of knowledge—especially, knowledge derived from meditation on
the higher truths of religion and philosophy which teach man how to understand
his own nature and bow he may be reunited with the Supreme Spirit the mind would
become firm and would be contiolled just as an elephant is controlled by means of a hook'
1 eplied Siddhichandra.
The Emperor demanded angrily —“How can
without such knowledge?”
I understand what you say
Siddhicandra replied “No such knowledge is requned to understand this.
For instance, a Brāhmin's mind does not relish pleasures in which your Majesty
indulges. Similarly, our minds have no inclination for such carnal pleasures, because
we never tasted them any time in our lives The people know that the mind of
a woman, who follows her dead husband by throwing herself to flames, is free from
attachment towards her other relations and all the things in the world In the same way,
the mind of the ascetic who practises austerities, iemains unaffected by worldly pleasures.
Absolute detachment from worldly shackles is their be-all and end-all of existence.
They are absorbed in the contemplation of the Supieme Spirit, and always immersed

in the ocean of tranquility. Kings and Emperors cannot daunt them who are as free as
fish in the sea of happiness. Their sojourn is always on the purest path and they are
always intent upon the acquisition of virtues Always obliging and always profuse
in meritorious actions, they are not slaves of the greed of possession, and are always
courageous in taking vows. Constant search of spiritual knowledge is the passion
of their lives, they are independent even of gods”
The Emperor was highly impressed by this spirited uttarance, and he stood
near him for a considerable time (258)
Verses 259 to 268 describe Nūramahallase the beautiful and beloved Empress.
She said to Siddhicandra -"How can firmness be compatible with youth? It is
impossible" Then Siddhicandra replied with justifiable pride "Was not the king
of Balaksa (Balkh )87 a man of unexceptionable self-control in the prime of his life 2
It is said of him that he renounced sixteen thousand palaces, eighteen lacs of horses
and his capital for the sake of God, the Supreme Spirit. For the purpose of spiritual
upliftment, age is immaterial. Firmness of mind is the result of merit earned in former
births. Flies though tiny can soar in the air, while elephants, thousands of times
larger in size, never can raise themselves an inch above the surface of the earth.
In the same way, some who have resorted to asceticism in childhood, have not stood firm,
but the number of elderly persons still hot in the pursuit of carnal pleasures is not small.
Hence old age is no consideration in acquiring firmness of mind." (274)
Annoyed at this, she replied — Asceticism is meant for those who have had
86 Nūramahalla -Her original name was Mehirunnisā At the age of seventeen, she was
married to a young Persian adventurer named Ali Qulı Istajlu, whose courage and skill in
kılling a tiger, von for him the title “Sher Afkun” (tiger-thrower) at the hands of
Prince Salım He was murdered by the agents of Salım in May, 1611 A D (Jyestha
S Y 1668) Then he, now Emperor Jahangir, married her and gave her the significant
name "Nūr Mahāl” (Light of Palace). Later on, in March 1616 (Chaitra S Y 1673),
she was given the name of “Nür Jahān" (Light of the World) Intensity of thought and
feeling, that unfailing mark of greatness, characterised all her life --Chap III “History of
Jahāngır" by Beniprasād (Siddhicandra has called her Nūramahalla This means that
the incident must have taken place between May 1611 and March 1616 A D (1 o s Y. 1668
Jyestha to 1673 Caitra)
87 This may be in reference to the famous saint by name Ebrāhim Ibn Adham, a native of
Balkh “He was the founder of the Adhamı order of Derveshes He died between 776 and 773
A D (160 and 166 H) The sufi legend concerning him is evidently modelled upon
the story of Buddha, for in it he appears as a prince who, while hunting, was warned
by an unseen voice that he was not created for such pursuits Thereupon he abandoned
the path of wordly pomp for the path of asceticism and piety There can, however,
be no doubt that Ibrāhim was a great figure in his day and his memory still survives
in Islām as far as India Leigh Hunt bestowed on Ibrāhim bin Adham the title of "Abou"
in his well-known lines -
“Abou spoke more low,
But cheery still, and said, I pray thee then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men"

their fill of sensual pleasures. It is meet that only those who have fully enjoyed
such pleasures, may renounce them. They would be good renounces too. Those who
took to asceticism before having had experience of these pleasures, should better be called
uncivilized because they cannot distinguish what is essential from what is not. Constant
enjoyment of a thing may result into disgust for the same. Mostly the mind always
darts at objects unseen and unexperienced. So, the mind of a man, who has not enjoyed
these pleasures, always hankers after them.” (279)
In an extremely gentle and sweet tone, the sage replied -“At piesent just
the reverse of what you said, is seen to happen in the Krta and other yugas it indeed
was a custom for people, who had pursued objects of pleasure in their youth, to turn
to asceticism in the latter part of life. In Kalr yuga, the ascetics generally tuin
voluptuaries In Krta yuga, peaple used to become vānapi asthas even before their
hair turned grey; in Kali yuga people remain, nay, grow more addicted to sensual
pleasures even after their whole bodies are covered with grey hairs In the age in which
we are born, everything is topsyturvy The young observe religious vows, while the old
break vows which they have alleady taken.” (283)
Then the Emperor said, “I have heard your arguments. They are very reasonable
and sound. At present, however, it is not meet that you should lead the life of
an ascetic. Your body is as fresh as the bud of a campaka tree Is it proper to throw
fire made of chaff on a mālatz (Jasmine) or to try to cleave the nalina creeper with
a saw? It would be as improper as to bind a sılken diess with leather straps. It is folly
to stuff one's eyes with soot. Would it be wise to hammer a glass jug? Would the wise
approve of dealing swoid-thrust to the interior column of plaintain tree? O, young man!
are the hardships like plucking hairs (of the head) &c, a fit treatment to your body which
is as delicate as the top of a s'arīsa flower? Of all the ās'ramas (four religious stages
of life), that of the householder is the highest, because the very existence of others depends
upon it. You are like an ocean surrounded by rivers, hence like an ocean you should
marry and stay like my son with me. It is universally accepted that the quintessence of
this mundane existence is seen personified in the fawn-eyed women. Hence, at my instance,
accept a wife, whereby your life on this earth would be useful due to the acquisition
of sons Even a tree, which does not bear fruit, is condemned by villagers. Begging
for food (one of the rules of conduct for Jaina Monks) is said to be inferioz even to a piece
of straw. Aren't you ashamed of a thing which is condemned as utterly unworthy ?
Oh, your beauty, your energy and your learning--all make you look lustrous; but your
walking on foot (another rule foi Jaina monks) mars everything. Whatever is created
by the Almighty is meant for our comfort Following that object of creation, we become
the happiest of all. In this world you are leading a miserable life. Your life in the next
world will be more miserable because you are intent upon transgressing the path
prescribed by God ” (297)
On hearing this well-reasoned words of the Sultan, Siddhicandra courageously
and promptly replied “Whatever has been ordered by Your Majesty is very true

and pleasing. That would move the hearts of those who are attached to worldly
things. Those, however, who are above passion and worldly pleasure, are not affected
by them.”
To this utterance of the Man of Intellect, the Emperor gave a learned rejoinder-
so learned indeed that it would astonish even great scholars —“There is nothing in
itself either good or bad, meritorious ol sinful, but our thinking makes it so The mind
is its own place, and can make heaven of hell and hell of heaven. A thing done with
a good motive is meritorious, and the same thing done with a wicked motive is sinful.
Even herein if there be any weak point, you should drive it away by means of penance
just as leanness produced by fasting can be removed by eating wholesome food. As
regards the duties of monks,—both general and particular-exceptions are laid down.
Therefore, to accept the absolute is futile for all Syādvāda (Jaina doctrine of relativity)
is applicable everywhere for those who believe in it Absolutism for such would amount
to heresy. Oh, wiseman! give up your wiong persistence and believe what I say.
Enjoy pleasures to your heart's content. Would any wise man err as to his own
interests?". (305)
Having heard these words of the Emperor-words which showed his admirable
grasp over the cardinal doctrine of Jaina philosophy and which contained a reprimand for
him-Siddhicandra, thinking only of his duties, replied without tremour _“All this
may be all right for the ears of a coward. A man of courage and conviction never
breaks a vow once he has taken it, even if his adherence to it meant certain death for him.
The least deviation from the path once chosen results into utter worthlessness and failure.
A very small thorn is sufficient to make a person unable to set his foot upon the earth and
to walk A thing, for expiating which penance should be performed, should be avoided
once and for all. Prevention is always better than cure. Why touch the mud and
then wash ourselves thorougly in order to be free from it? Why not avoid it altogether?
Exceptions are meant for those who have not power enough to stick to the absolute rules.
They are loop-holes through which the weak-minded seek relief from the severity
and inexorableness of the absolute principles Those who have perfect control over
their minds, need not take shelter even under the doctrine of relativity. Only the weak
seek to twist its meaning to suit their breaches of rule which they have not the grit
to observe. The propounders of syādvāda do not recognize the absolutism even of
syādvāda In all my previous births, I had wives and children. There was no religion in
having them. Why should I renounce religion for that mode of life? Human life is
dearest to all, and so it is to me Even if that were to be taken from me this very
moment, I would not deviate even by a hair's breadth for the path of life which
I have chosen for myself.” (313)
Those present in the Court-Ministers and others--began to say "Fie upon such
doggedness of this man. Though he is wise, he has been his own enemy and has
brought upon himself a great calamity for the sake of a petty matter."
Siddhicandra, however, in spite of these biting remarks, remained adamantly firm.

The Emperor, hot with anger, said, “Do you dare to disregard me? Don't you
know my power 2 If angiy, I am the God of Death incarnate, if pleased, a krepa drunco
(a tree supposed to fulfill all desiies) Now you will get the fruit of this poisonous
tree in the form of your fool-hardiness and doggedness" So saying the Emperor,
appearing like the God of Death, ordered a dreadful and ricious elephant to be brought
there (317)
Veises 318 to 321 give the description of the elephant
The elephant was brought by the drivers The Emperor, spoke turning towards
Siddhicandra, “Accept the life of a house-holder and enjoy pleasures with comely women.
Be honoured with the lordship over some countıy and still further receive horses and
elephants from me Obey this my last command. Or else, I will make you a guest of
the God of death in a trice” (327)
He answered, “Though this suffering is difficult to go through, it will be beneficial
to me as it is the result of the performance of my duty ” (328)
The Emperor angrily shouted, “The fool will not come to his senses unless
he is treated with fierce blows and cruel torture”. Turning to him, he said “Now,
taste the bitter fruit of your foolish persistence”. The mad elephant glaring viciously
at the monk gave out a roar, which, commingled with the hoarse shouts of the multitude,
sounded like the bursting of a volcano. The monk stood firm as a rock, unpuiterbed
by the imminent onslaught of the demon of death The Emperor's astonishment
was profound, and he ordered that the monk was to reture into a forest as punishment
for disobedience of his orders Siddhicandıa, without any tremour, left the Court
The Emperor issued a firmān which was circulated throughout the Empire Its wordings
were “Other Mumuksus ( sages striving foi final emancipation) residing in my empire
are all to retire into the forest, as it is proper for those disinterested hermits to stay
only there ( 1. e in the forest) 188 (334)
88 Cf Vijaya-Tilaha Sūri Rāsa Arlhrkāra 1, composed in S Y 1679 by Darsanavijaya states
in verses 435 to 439 about the time of S Y 1670 Jahāngir was angry and passed
a banishment-order, hence several Jaina monks came to Surat from other places', and in
other verses from 1179 to 1185 describes Siddhicandra 18 remaining undaunted agruinst
the order of Jahāngır asking him to marry, even under the threat of being tramplad upon
by elephants and at last being called back and honoured by the Emperor Jahāngir, also vide
Hira Süri Rāsa composed by Rsabhadāsa in S Y 1685 pp 185 and 186 verses 1 to 8
The attitude of Jahāngır towards recluses may be contrasted with that of his father Akbar
who clearly expressed “(1) whoever by his brilliant destiny withdraws his affections from
all wouldly concerns attains to the Divine love which is above all others (p 380),
(2) Whoever seeks from me permission to retire from this world will meet with cheerful
acquiescence in his desires If he has really withdrawn his heart from the world that deceives
but fools, to dissuade him therefrom would be very represensible, but it he only affects it
from ostentation, he will receive the requital thereof," p 387 Aini Akbarı III-The Happy

The best of the Upādhyāyas (Bhānucandra), endowed with numerous virtues
as he was-was honoured and kept at the Court by the Emperor. He continued
to pieach to the Emperor His sermons ennobled the lives of many deserving persons.
Siddhicandıa, on the other hand, reached Mālapui a89, where in compliance with
the request of the local Jaina congregation, he passed the monsoon without any
inconvenience. (337)
Once the Emperor, seated in the Court and in a cheerful mood, marked that
the Upādhyāya's mind, afflicted with some sorrow, did not share the joviality of
the atmosphere around him Then the Emperor affectionately called him by his side
and gently asked him to state the cause of so much mental anguish. The Upādhyāya
then said, “From the spiritual point of view, we bear sorrow by the fact of our
existence in this would, no other sorrow affects those who are immune from worldly
ties and who strive constantly for final emancipation Still, Your Majesty, my heart
is not strong enough to dispel the sorrow caused by the long separation of my
best pupil”. (341)
Then the Emperor remembered the adamantine firmness of Siddhicandra in
the performance of his duties, and thought, “Fie upon me, who out of delusion,
disregarded his religious faith” Then he cheerfully issued a firmān authorizing
the return of Siddhicandia to the Court The latter received the firmān at Mālapura,
and immediately started for Agrā which he reached after a short time. A hearty
and magnificent welcome awaited him there. His fame spread everywhere. ( 346 )

Once Siddhicandra paid a visit to the royal Court, on an auspicious day The
Emperor lavished praises upon him and said, “You ale the blessed among the blessed,
the respected among the respected Who is there in this world who can come to your
level in being endowed with sattva (goodness ) 2 You have not deviated even by
a hair's breadth from the chosen path of duty. Your adherence to it is unsurpassed
You are the honoured of the honoured O Patient one' out of anger I treated
you rudely. You got through the test quite successfully, and turned your difficulty
to an opportunity, on account of your virtues”.
Then Siddhicandra, who had attained wide celebrity said to the repentent Emperor,
in a thought-provoking speech, “You have committed no offence On the contrary,
O blessed one! you have obliged me because, with the strength of your help, my wicked
“ harma” has been annihilated. Besides, if there was any offence on my part,
the same should be forgiven by you as I became instrumental in some bad "karma"
accruing to you." (353)

The Emperor with tears of joy in his eyes, told him repeatedly, “Please tell me
what is proper for me to do I shall do it at once" Siddhicandıa ieadily responded,
“ Please issue a filmān allowing the return of those monks, who were banished to forests
by the order of Your Majesty, to the country as before" The Emperor immediately issued
the firmān allowing the monks to stay or to go where they pleased and got it calculated
everywhere. The monks ieturned to cities and villages where they were received with
festivities on a grand scale. (358)
V. FURTHER FACTS GATHERED FROM OTHER SOURCES
This work is silent about the early life of our hero We gather some information
about it and about other relevant matters from other sources —
A banıā by name Rāmaji was living at Siddhapur in Gujarāt (now in Gaikwād
territories ). He had a wife by name Ramāde She once saw an elephant in a dream.
Thereafter she gave birth to our hero who was named Bhānaji. He was put to school
at the age of seven. When he was about ten years old, he and his elder brother,
Rangaji by name, happened to hear a religious discourse by Sūracandra Pannyāsa.
Later on both the brothers were initiated into Jaina Holy Order, and were named
Bhānucandra and Rangacandra, by their preceptor the said Sūracandra. They studied
Jaina scriptures and earned the title Pannyāsa (a Pandit) They also initiated many
persons as monks. In recognition of their intrinsic worth, Hira Vijaya Sūrı deputed them
to the Court of Akbar. The Emperor was highly impressed by the learning, wisdom and
personality of Bhānucandra Saikh Abul Fazl became very much attached to him.'
Thus he acquired fame and name at the royal court
We know that Akbar engaged Bhānucandıa to teach the Jaina tenets to his
princes Salım and Dāniāl because he recognised in him a falvor (ascetic) of the first order.
Once Akbar suffered from a severe head-ache All the expert physicians were
called, and in spite of their best efforts the pain could not be lessened a jot. Then
Bhānucandra was called. He put his hand on the Emperor's head and muttered
Pārsva-Mantra. Akbar experienced great relief His faith in Jaina monks thereupon
became unshakable.
When the nobles came to know of the Emperor's recovery, they proposed
to the Emperor that 500 cows brought by them should be offer ed as an oblation.
The Emperor, however, rejected the idea, and summoned Bhānucandra to his presence.
He offered him the 500 cows as a gift of honour and lequested him to ask for anything
he desired Bhānucandra thereupon requested him to abolish the Jazıā tas and to issue
90 This happened at Āgrā before the autumn of 1613 A D (24 Shahrigar--Isvina S'udı 2
S Y 1670-6-9-1613) on which day Jahāngir left Āgrā for Ajmere where he established his
Camp and Court Vide ·History of Jabāngir' Benipzasad

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
proclamation that she-buffaloes and he-buffaloes, and cows and bulls should be protected
1. e should neither be killed nor be molested The Emperor readily acceded to the request
and a royal firmān was issued accordingly
Once, a Brāhmm Pandit, Satyavādı by name, came to the Court of Akbar
and being proud of his learning challenged to enter into debate with any Pandit
of the Emperor's Court. Bhānucandra, being asked by Akbar, accepted the challenge
Much to the Pandit's chagin and disgrace, he was defeated by the Jaina monk.
(Vide pp 180 to 186, 189, 302 Hirasūs i’s Rāsa by Rsabhadāsa)
In or about S Y 1650, Bhānucandra was at Campāpuri as Prācīna-tīrtha-mālā-
Sangraba at p 130 states that in S Y. 1646 King Kalyāņa-sena of Suvarna-Kāntı
started on a pilgrimage to Sati unjaya and reached after 3 years Sameta śikhara
from where he went to Campāpuri and paid respects to Lord Vāsupūjya and
Bhānucandra Upādhyāya
(We have seen the monk's career during the reign of Jahāngir till his firmān
banishing all the sādhus was withdrawn. What happened thereafter is being now
narıated).
From Āgrā, Bhānucandra went to Mālpur where he defeated some followers
of the Vijā Secto1 At his instance a Jaina temple with a gold kalas'a was erected,
and he consecrated an idol therein (in S. Y 1672). He passed the monsoon at Jälore
in Mārwār and init:ated 21 pupils there (Vide Hira Sūri Rāsa p 184 to 185).
91 A sect founded by Vijā in S Y 1570 This sect has its temple still extant at Mālpur wherein
the principal idol is that of Ādinātha, and which is known as Vijaya Gaccha's temple
92 This is borne out by the inscription of S Y 1672 inscribed on the black makrānā stone slab
of the innermost portion of the larger temple at Mālpur now known as Munisuvrata's temple
which clearly states that at the instance of Bhānucandra and as the result of the trouble
taken by Siddhicandra in securing the land and site of the temple, the Jaina congregation of
Mālpur led by Shā Bāgā constructed a temple in the honour of Lord Candraprabha,
It runs as under –

While on his way to Ahmedābād, with the royal fir mān appointing him the Governor
of Gujarāt, Makarabkbān°3 halted at Jālore and saw Bhānucandia with due respect
The Khan asked him whether he could be of any service to him. The Upādhyāya
thereupon said to him that Jaina sadhus belonging to the Sāgara group were acting
contrary to the behests of the late and the most revered Hila-Vijaya Sūri Vijayadera
Sūrı had, moreover, joined hands with them, and this act of his was improper Makalab-
kbān replied that if Siddhicandra was sent with him, he would act as desired by him
Accordingly, Sıddhicandia started with him and both 1eached Siddhapur after a time.
Vijayadeva Sūri from Pūtan sent a monk by name Dhanavijaya and ten leading
Jainas to receive Siddhicandia at Siddhapui and invited him to come to Pātan and
to receive the title of Upādhyāya from the Sūri Siddhicandra lejected the said offer
saying that he would act up to his Master's instructions. He without being deflected
from his project reached Ahmedābād via Mehsānā.
At Ahmedābād Siddhicandra joined Somavijaya Upādhyāya who exerted his best
to dissuade Vijayadeva Sūri from taking the side of the Sāgaia group and suggested
peaceful steps for bringing about unity. All his attempts however failed. It was then
felt that adoption of some drastic action was necessary
Prominent Upādhyāyas by name Somavijaya, Nandivijaya, Vijayarāja, Dharma-
vijaya and Bhānucandra and the poet Siddhicandra and other monks, who on invitation
gathered at Ahmedābād from different places, got a learned monk by name Rāmavijaya
invested with the title of Ācārya at the hands of Vijayasundara Sūri Bhattāraka of
Vadašākbā, named him Vijayatılaka Sūli on Paoşa Sudı 12 S. Y. 1673 Wednesday
(8-1-1617 A. D) at Ahmedādād and accepted him as the successor of Vijayasena Sūri.
At the time Siddhicandia was granted the title of tācala 1. e Urīdhyāya. This festive
occasion was celebrated with great eclat by the help of Subā Mukarabkhān who greatly
honoured the new Sūl. and supplied his men, horses and elephants for the occasion.
At the instance of the Sūri, Nandivijaya went to Māndu, while Bhānucandra with
his pupıl Sıddhicandra went to Suohi. At Māndu, Nandivijaya saw Emperor Jahāngir
who was there at the time. The Emperor paid respects to him and zememberiny
Bhānucandra wished that he was there

Two Mevrās with the imperial firmān calling Bhānucandra came to Ahmedābād
and handed over the firtān to Makarabkhān the Viceroy of Gujarāt The Subā saw
Vijayatılaka Sūri and learnt from him that Bhānucandra was at Sirohiº5. Bhānucandra
was called by the Sūri and Dharmavijaya Upādhyāya was sent in his place at Sirohi.
When Bhānucandra came to Ahmedābād, he was honoured by the Suri and the Subā.
Coming to know of the Emperor's call, he forth with started and arrived at Māndu.
Jahāngir was much pleased at seeing Bhānucandra and requested him to impart
religious instructions to his son Saharıyār as he used to do to his illustrious father
(Akbar) He further said that he had great affection-regard for him and asked him
to say what he could do for him Bhānucandra submitted that His Majesty was
well aware that Hiravijaya Sūri on invitation had paid frequent visits to his father,
Emperor Akbar, who had invested the Sūri with the title of Jagadguru, his successor
Vijayasena Sūri bestowed through misplaced affection the title of Acārya upon
Vijayadeva Sūri who at the time acted in contravention of the resolutions passed by those
predecessors of his against the Sāgara group-monks and made common cause with them;
consequently he and many other sādhus left his fold and appointed another Ācārya;
and the Emperor would be pleased to see that the said Vijayadeva Sūri and his colleagues
would not do anything derogatory to those pīo vācāryas Thereupon Jahāngir gave him
to understand that he would do what he wanted him to do Bhānucandra stayed
there and began to instruct Prince Saharıyār The Emperor gave written directions
to the officers at Ahmedābād, Surat and Baroda that Sāgara group be stopped from
troubling the other group.
At the time during the monsoon, there arose a great quarrel between the
followers of Sāgara and Vijaya-two Tapā groups at Burhānpur Darsanavijaya came from
Burhānpur and the matter was brought to the notice of Bhānucandra who asked
Siddhicandra to approach the Emperor to bring the offenders to book. The Emperor
passed necessary orders to his son Khuram Sultāne (who was then in the supreme
command of the army at Burhānpur). Peace was restored on the offenders tendering
apology.

When Bhānucandia and Siddhicandra spoke to Jahāngi as to how the quarrel
arose and peace was restored at Buihānpui, the Emperor desied that such state of affairs
be stopped for ever and unity be established Hence be called both the Ācāryas-
Vijayadeva Sūri and Vijayatılaka Sūri to Māndu-Both came there Nemisāgara
Upādhyāya of Sāgara group at the bidding of Vijayadeva Sūrı reached Mandu
to join his side.
The Emperor called both the Ācāryas before him and wanted to know what
the dispute was Nemısāgara replied that the other side did not respect the prominent
pupil and successor of the great Acāryas (1 e Vijayadeva Sūrı) Bhānucandra for th with
retorted, One who would not respect Hira Sūri's commands, and contiary to the same
would have faith in the doctrines laid down in a book (Dharmasāgara Upādhyāya's
Sarvajna Sataha, a new edition of Prarricana Pariksā, proscribed and rejected by the
late lamented Sūris as opposed to scriptures), is not entitled to any respect. Nemisāgara
insisted upon that work being in consonance with the sacred books Jahāngir inquired
of Vijayadeva Sūri what the real matter was Vijayadeva Sūlı stated that the work
in question was wrongly denounced by the other side as contraiy to scriptures ?
At that time the Emperor argued – Though they denounced the work as untiue
wrongly, you should take it as such if you believe in your pūrvācāryas and inspite of that
if you put faith in such work, you would be acting against your own masters'.
Nemisāgala retorted saying if any statements in that work were proved untrue, his side
was piepared to correct the same The Emperor curtly said "Is your knowledge
more than that of your Masters who declared the docti ines of the work as untrue
If you would not have faith in your Masters' words, your reputation will die out.
Please attend to your duties and cease fighting amongst yourselves.'
Bhānucandra pointed to Vijayatılaka Sūrı as their true head and the newly
nominated true successoi of Vijayasena Sūrı, because he acted in the footsteps of that
Sūri. The Emperor opined that it was good of him to do so and that he be accepted
as the tiue guru
Vijaya-tılaka Sūri then came to Ahmedābād where Jahāngir and Bhānucandra
also arrived. Thus Bhānucandra and Siddhicandra had taken a prominent part
and peace was concluded The Prince left Bui hānpur reaching Mandu on October 12,
1617 A D (Sunday 8th Kārtika Vad S Y 1674 Hındı) (T J says Shāb Jeh in paid respects
and offered presents to Jahāngir on Thursday the 10th of the month Shavval 1036 H which

greatly honoured and styled Shāh Jahān (king of the world) by the Emperor Then
the Emperor with Nūr Jahān started for Cambay where they reached after a leisurely journey
of two months, halting there for 10 days Leaving Cambay on December 30, 1617

in working against Vijayadeva Sūri (Vide Vijayatılaka Sīri Rāsa Adhrkāra I, composed
by Darśanavijaya in S Y 1679 Mārgaśırsa Vadı 8th at Burhānpur)
According to the other ačcount, at Māndu Emperor Jahāngir asked the local
leading Jaina Candıapāla to call Vijayadeva Sūri The Sūri was passing the monsoon
at Cambay and on receipt of the invitation started for Māndu and reached it on
Aśvina Sukla 13th S Y. 1673 (Gujarātı while Hindi S Y. 1674 corresponding with
English date 2–10–1617 Thursday) The next day the interview took place. The
Emperor received him with due respect, and being pleased with the Sūri's strong body
despite his severe austerities, gave him the title of Jahāngira Mahā-Tapā (1. e, a great
austere man acknowledged by Jahangir) He disarmed the opposition of the Sūri's
opponents and enjoined the Sanghapati Candrapāla to take the Śūrı in a big procession
to the accompaniment of the imperial band to his halting place Further he declared
that the Sūri was the acknowledged head-preceptor of the Jaina sangha (Vide
17th Chapter of Vijayadeva-Mahātmyam a sanskrit versical composition by Vallabha
Upādhyāya of Kharatara gaccha We have already mentioned about these accounts
in this introduction at pages 20-21 under the heading of Vijayadeva Sūri and
Nemisāgara Upādhyāya).
[Looking from a broad point of view, both the accounts are correct so far
as the general facts are concerned, though each in the end prejudicially takes one-sided
view. Both the Sūris were summoned after Bhānucandra was called at Māndu
by the Emperor to bi ing about peace and amity between the two opposing parties.
That Vijayadeva Sūri was invested with the title Jahāngırı Mahā-Tapā”, cannot be
denied though the first account is totally silent on that point, as that fact is borne out
by that title having been expressly engraved in the subsequent consecration-inscriptions
of Vijayadeva Sūri. Both parties must have been appeased by the Emperor
by sweet pursuation to the effect that the preceding Acāryas' actions be respected and
they should behave towards each other properly and live peacefully and amicably 1
It is said about Siddhicandra that once thirty two thieves at Burhānpur were
on the point of being put to sword, when Siddhicandra obtained an imperial firmān
and saved all of them from being put to death. They were released and provided
with clothes, similarly many nobles were saved from punishments. Jayadāsa and
Appo-Lād Banvās who were sentenced to be trampled under the feet of an elephant
on account of their killing an elephant wiongfully, were got released by Siddhicandra
(Hira Sūri Rāsa p 185).
In S. Y. 1690 (1633–34 A D) Mehājala the sanghapatı led a sangha from
Nādalāı on a pilgrimage to the Satrunjaya. Vijayānanda Sūrı (the successor of
the above Vijayatılaka Sūri on Pausa Sukla 14th S. Y 1676_Saturday 8th January
1620 A D.) and Siddhicandra Upādhyāya joined the said sangha at Dholkā.
(see the above Vijaya-tilaka Sūri Rāsa Adhikāra II composed by Darśanavijaya
in S. Y 1698 and Prācīna-tīrtha-mālā-samgraha p 106)
No information is available as to actually when Bhānucandra died but it is

surmised that he may have died before S. Y. 1690, as Siddhicandra is mentioned to have
joined the above sangha alone 1. e unaccompanied by Bhānucandia.
As to himself Siddhicandra says the title of Khus-faham (a man of sharp
intellect) was conferred upon him for his avadhānas not only by the Emperor Akbar
Jalaldın but also by the Emperor Jahāngir Nuruddin, and the latter further invested
him with the titles of Nadira-Jamān (the unique of the age) and Jahāngira-pasandt
(Favourite of Jahāngir) as appears in the ending prose-portion of his works Jinas' ataka
Tīkā and Anehārthopasarga Vrtti. He performed avadhānas to the number of 108
ie he could attend to 108 things at a time ( see the initial 2nd verse of his Bhaktāmara-
stotra-Vrttı) On seeing him in his early age as handsome as cupid, Akbar treated
him as his own son. (Vāsavadattā-Tīkā's intitial 9th verse) and he was just like
a bee engrossed in the lotus flower in the form of the heart of Emperor Akbai
(Jinas'ataka-tīkā's ending 1st verse, and Bhahtāmarc-stotra-tihă's initial 3rd verse).
It is stated in the piesent work that he was 25 years of age when Jahangir the
Emperor issued his unjustifiable order of banishing him and other sådhus This happened
probably in S. Y. 1668 or 1669 but certainly before S. Y 1670 Āśvina Áudi 2nd
( Monday 6-9–1613 A. D. see footnote No. 90 )—the date of departure of Jabāngir
from Āgrā for Ajmere. Besides he gave the year of composing his Jinas'ataka-Tikā
as S Y. 1714 at Sanghapur (near Vijapur in Gujarāt) and in his own time his
Kavya-prakās'a khandana was copied in S. Y. 1722, hence it can be safely said that
he lived at least 67 years.
We come across another Jaina monk by name Bhānucandra who was also
a contemporary of our hero Bhānucandra, in the ardha-hathānaka (half autobio-
graphy) of the great Hindi Jaina poet and philosopher Banārasıdāsa who states thereinº
“I was engrossed in sexual science. Then in S. Y 1657 Abhayadharma Upādhyāya
of Kharatara gaccha visited Jaunpur with his two pupils by name Bhānucandra who was
a clever monk and Rāmacandra a boy in a layman's garments. Bhānucandra by dint of
his learning and saintly character became very popular Once I with my father went
to hear his sermon and by constant visits became much attached to him and used
to take lessons from him I learnt and committed to memory Panca-sandhi, Sāmayrha
and Pratikramana sütras (Jaina ceremonial works), Chandasästra, S'rutabodha, Kosa
and numerous Sanskrit verses. Besides I took eight vows from him. Notwithstanding
that, sexual attachment did not leave me,”

Rsabhadāsa a Gujarāti poet was a contemporary of Bhānucandra. He in his
Hiravr, aya-Sūri-Rāsa composed in S. Y 1685 states at p. 185 - Bhānucandra from

2. Ratnapāla-Kathānakam-A story in Sanskrit illustrating benefits from the
charity of supplying water to the thirsty (A MS. copy written in S. Y. 1662 at Mālpur

in Hansavijaya's Bhandār at Baroda No 1199 and another copy is in Vivekavijaya
Yati's Bhandār at Udaipur No. 194)
4 Kādambarī-pūrvārdha-tīkā—a Sanskrit commentary of the first half of
Kādambari of Bāna-bhatta, composed during the times of Vijaya-tilaka Sūrı Circa
S. Y 1673 to 1676), It is the only commentary extant on Bāna's said work (Printed and
published by Nirnaya sāgara Press, Bombay).
5 Sārasvata-Vyākarana-yrtti-tippana or vivarana-A Sanskrit commentary
on Särasvata Prakriyā which is itself a commentary by Ksemendra a son of Haribhatta
(Buhler III, 30 N. P i e North-West provinces Allahabad 1877-86 referred to in
Catalogus Catalogorum 1891 A. D.) who composed it on Narendra's Dhātupātha

6 Kāvyaprakās'a-vivștı-Kāvyaprakāśa is a well-known work in Sanskrit

by him in his report of 1883-84 at p 17 para 14 The said Bhandār is situated
at Dośivāda's pole at Ahmedībad and is not now easily accesible).
It appears this work of Bhānucandia is different from Siddh:candra's Kavya-
prakāsa-khandana

Nāma-sangraha (referred to in Cata Cata. II), Vivikta-nāma-sangraha (referred

Kāndas (parts) viz. Devādhideva, Deva, Manusya, Trryak, Nāraka and Sāmānya-Kündas.

INTRODUCTION.
The author says the work was composed for his pupils Bhāvacandra and others for their
proper understanding. Occasionally Gujarāti words are also used for clarification
As Vivihta-nama-sangraha it is referred to in Mitra's notices X p 151 No. 4015
where it is described as a commentary on the rāma-sangraha of Hema Ācārya
commonly called Hema Kosha. Its colophon extracted there states that the commentary
was composed during the reign of Vijayasena Sūrı (who died in S. Y. 1672 Hindi)
hence the maximum date of its composition is before s Y. 1672 (A MS. copy is
available in Dehlā-Upāśraya Bhandār Ahmedābād. It is of 113 folios and is written in

IX. THE PRESENT WORK.
The present work is divided in 4 Chapters, each dealing with certain special events
and hence all are not in sequence of time-one after the other It is edited from a
single MS made available to me by my friend Mr Agarchand Nāhatā of Bikaner
from Jayacandra Yati's collection at Bikāner. The said ms contains 33 folios of 13
lines on its each side and measures 104 inches in length and 41 inches in width. It is
written on somewhat rough and thick country paper It was copied by Gunacandıa, a
pupil of Devacandra and Vivekacandra—the latter two, pupils of Bhānucandra our hero
and co-pupils of the authoi The present text of this work seems to be somewhat
incomplete as evidently appears from the absence of three following veises of Bhānu-
candiagani Carta quoted by the author in his later work entitled Bhaltāmera-stotic
Vrtti while commenting on the 39th verse of the said stotra -
वक्तु शिरासि शराणा पतितानि महीतले । जयश्रियो रक्तपङ्के पादन्यामोपलभ्रमम् ॥ १ ॥
असुभिरपि यियाभि प्रविश्य, प्रतिभटमू बनि कोऽपि दत्तपाद । फलमिह मनुजन्मनोपलब्ब यशसि रतिमहता न देहपिण्डे ॥ २ ॥
महति समरसकटे भटोऽन्य प्रतिभटनिर्दलनात्ममाप्तशस्त्र । अगणितमरण प्रविश्य वेगादरिकरत करवालमाचर्ष ॥ ३ ॥
-इत्यस्मन्निर्मितमहोपाध्यायश्रीभानुचंद्रगणिचरित्रात् ।
As no other manuscript of the work could be obtained, some errors are likely
to have escaped notice in spite of utmost care taken and it is hoped the readers will
excuse the same
This is a historical composition The authenticity of the incidents mentioned
therein is proved as they are corroborated by independent and comtemporaneous autho-
rities consulted and quoted by me My thanks are due to my friends Hessis Acārya
and Mohanlāl Mehtā Advocates as well as to Mi Mohanlal Jhavely Solicitor for going
through portions of my manuscript, and specially to Mi Ratılāl J. Desāı M. A for
revising the same and Khānbāhadur Prof M S Commissariat M A I. E S. (Retired)
for revising the Appendix II
It is difficult for a student to obtain iare old books i equired for preparing a
composition particularly on such an old historical subject Foi enabling me to avail of
the books necessary for the preparation of this introduction I am indebted to Seth
Hirālāl Amratlāl B A, Pandit Lālachandra B Gāndhi of Baroda Oriental Institute,
D. B Krisnālal M Jhaveri, Mı. 'Kokil' and Bombay University Library.
Lastly, Śrı Jinavijayajı, the learned and able General Editoi, of the excellent
Singhi Jarna Series deser ves my gratitude for his prompting me to under take the work
of editing this work with an elaboiate English introduction and Bābu Buhādui Singhji
Singbī, is all the more to be thanked as he, a great lover of literature and cultuie, has
utilised his wealth towards founding the present unique Series, in order to bring out
many precious gems of Jaina literature.

APPENDIX I
This contains the initial and final portions of available works of Bhānucandra
and Siddhicandia and is appended with the text at its end.
APPENDIX II
Translations of Imperial Farmāns granted by the Emperors Akbar and Jahāngır.
1 Farmān of the Emperor Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar Shāh Bādshah
Gāzı ordering his officials not to allow slaughter of animals during 12 days
of the Jaina Paryusana festival. Dated 7th Jumād-ul-Sanı 992 Hijri (6th
June 1584 A. D--1st Āsādha Sukla 9th S Y. 1641 Hindi.)
[ When Sir John Malcolm was stationed in Mālvā as a political officer in the
first quarter of the 19th century, he was shown Akbar's fai mān to which he refers in his
Memoirs of Central India (Ed. of 1832) II, pp 163-4-5 footnote, ( Ed, of 1880) II,
pp. 135 and 136 n. to this eflect -'An application was made to me to prevent the slaying
of animals during the Putchoosur, or twelve days which they hold sacred, and the
original Firman of Akber ( carefully kept by their high priest at Oojein) was sent for my
perusal. The following is a literal translation of this curious document -
“In the name of God, God is great."
"Firman of the Emperor Julalo-deen-Mahomed Akber, Shah, Padshah, Ghazee,
"Be it known to the Moottasuddies of Mālwā, that as the whole of our desires
consist in the performance of good actions, and our virtuous intentions are constantly
directed to one object, that of delighting and gaining the hearts of our subjects, &c
“We, on hearing mention made of persons of any religion or faith whatever
who pass their lives in sanctity, employ their time in spiritual devotion and are alone
intent on the contemplation of the Deity, shut our eyes on the external forms of their
worship, and, considering only the intention of their hearts, we feel a powerful inclination
to admit them to our association, from a wish to do what may be acceptable to the
Deity. On this account, having heard of the extraordinary holiness and of the severe
penances performed by Hırbujisoor (Hira-Vijaya Sūrı) and his disciples, who reside in
Guzerat, and are lately come from thence, we ordered them to the presence, and they had
been ennobled by having permission to kiss the abode of honour.... ..
“After having received their dismissal and leave to proceed to their own cou-
ntry, they made the following request -That if the King, the protector of the poor, would
issue orders that during the twelve days of month Bhodon, called Putchoossur, (which
are held by the Jains to be particularly holy), no cattle should be slaughtered in the cities
where their tribe reside, they would thereby be exalted in the eyes of the world, the lives

Page 97****************************************************************************************
BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
of a number of living animals would be spared, and the actions of his Majesty would be
acceptable to God, And as the persons who made this request came from a distance, and
their wishes were not at variance with the ordinances of our religion, but on the contrary
were similar in effect with those good works prescribed by the venerable and the holy
Mussulman, we consented and gave orders that, during those twelve days called Putchoos-
sur, no animal should be slaughtered.
“The present sunnud is to endure for ever, and all are enjoined to obey it, and use
their endeavours that no one is molested in the performance of his religious ceremonies.
Dated 7 th Jumad-ul Sanı 992 Hejirah” ( 6th June 1584 A, D.) See p 7.
2. Farmān of the Emperor Jalālu-d-din Muhammad Akbar ordering Azam Khan
the Governor of Gujarāt, to see that Hilavijaya Sūri and other Jainas be respec-
ted and their temples and religious places allowed to be repaired or re-erected.
Dated the 6th of Azār in the Ilāhı year 35, 1. e. the 28th of Muharram Hijri
year 999 (1591 A. D.)
God is great.
Farmān of Jalāl-ud-din Muhammad Akbar Bādshāh Gāzi,
“Be it known to Mubārız-ud-dın Āzam Khān, having received royal favours
and being exalted with the honour of getting more gifts, who is the supporter of the
great empire, loyal to the great kingdom, gifted with good temper and best virtues,
strengthener of the invincible empire, trustworthy for the best empire and a typical
model of Khāns of high order, that in order that persons of different modes of conduct,
adherents of particular and different faiths, civil and uncivil, small or great, prince or
pauper, wise or unwise, persons of every order on type in this world, every individual
whereof is the place for the divine lustre to become manifest, and the real spot for the
fate destined by the Creator of the world to unfold itself, as well as the reserved site full
of wonders of the Mover of the creation, may remain firm in their respective best
paths and enjoying physical and mental happiness may remain occupied in daily worship
and ceremonials and in achieving all their objects, and may pray that we may have long
life from the Giver of excellent gifts, and that we may be urged to do good acts,
because the perfect wisdom in raising one of mankind to the position of a king and
clothing him with the garb of a leader lies in this way that he may keep before his eyes
general kindness and great meroy which is the light of God's perfect mercy, and if he
cannot attain friendship with all, at least he lays the foundation of peace with all and
walks on a road of grace, love and mercy of all the servants of the Adorable and directing
bis attention on rendering help to all things created by God, who are the fruits of the
21 eation of God the highest, may assist them in fulfilling their objects and in carrying out
heir usages and practices, so that the strong may not be able to persecute the weak
and every man may be pleased aud happy,

INTRODUCTION-APPENDIX II

Therefore, keeping in view of the genuineness of the yoga practices and
search for God of Hirvijay Sūri Sevdā (who is the best of those practising yoga) and of
the followers of his faith, who have received the honour of presenting themselves before
us, and who are real well-wishers of oui Court, it is ordered that no inhabitant of that
city should interfere with them, not should lodge in their temples and upāśrayas
(resting-places) nor insult them Besides if any (of their temples or upāsrayas) has fallen
down or became dilapidated, and if any one among those respecting and liking him or
desirous of giving in charity, desired to iepan it or rebuild it, there should not be any i estia-
int by any having superfluous knowledge oi fanaticism And as those who do not know God,
level against those humble God-knowing men accusations of rain-stopping and such other
acts which are in God's power, under the belief due to foolishness and stupidity that those
are the result of some magic, and put them under many hardships, such misdeeds should
not be repeated during your administi ation and protection as you are a man of good fortune
and intellect Besides, it is heard that Hāji Habibullāh101, who knows little of our quest
for truth and i ealisation of God, has harmed this community, hence our pure mind, which
manages the world, has been afflicted with pain, so you should iemain so watchful over
your māsat that none can persecute any one The guiding principle of the present and
future Häkems, Nawābs, and Mutasaddis administering in full or in part the ruāsat on
that side, is that they should consider the order of the king, which is another form of
God's farmān, as the means of bettering their position and should not act contrary to
the same, and in doing so they should find happiness of the faith and the world and
genuine renown. This farmān should be read and after keeping its copy be supplied
to them, in order that the same may prove to be a sannad for them for ever, and
they may not feel concerned while doing their devotional cermonies, and may be inclined

BHĀNUCANDRA CARITRA
"God is great."
Nishān of Abul Muzaffar Sultan [ Shāh Salim Ghāzi ).
At present the exalted Nishān has the honour by royal favour to be issued
that the present and future Häkems (Governors), Jāgurdārg10, Karoris (tax gatherers)
and mutasaddis ( administrators) of the Subah of Gujarāt and the Sarkar of Sorath
have been given the fai mān with the execllent and happy mark, prohibiting killing
of cows, bullocks, she-buffaloes and he-buffaloes at any time and flaying them in the
presence of Sevdās (Jaina monks) and on the reverse of the said excellent farmān it is
written that in every month during several specified days (described below), the non-
eating of the flesh of these should be enjoined. This should be considered as dutiful and
proper. Also the hunting or encaging of those creatures who kept their nests in houses
or on trees, should be carefully avoided. Moreover, it is written in the said farmān, worth
to be obeyed that Vijayasen Sūri Sevdā, disciple of Hirvijaya Sūri, the best of those
practising yoga, and the adherents to his faith, had the honour of being present at our
court and were special well-wishers of our court, and that in view of the genuineness of
their growing yoga practices and search for God, it was ordered that no one should put
up in their temples or upāsrayas (resting-places) nor insult them, and if these ( religious
places) became too old and in consequece any of their followers, admirers or those doing
charity repaired or rebuilt them, no one with superficial knowledge or fanaticism should
prevent them (from doing so ) And as those, who do not know God, level on those
humble God-knowing men accusations of rain-stopping and such other acts, which are
the acts of the Almighty, under the belief due to foolishness and stupidity that these
are the result of some magic, and put them to hardships of many kinds, and stop them
from performing their religious ceremonies, we ordain that imputations for such acts
should not be levelled against those humble men and they should be freely allowed to
devote themselves to God at their quarters and resting places and to perform ceremonies
in accordance with their religion.
Hence the said excellent farmān should be carried out and strict warning be given
that the same be executed in the best manner and none should pass any order contrary to
the same. (Everybody) should consider it as his duty and should not excuse it and should
not act against it. Dated the 1st of the month Shaharyur Ilāhı Year 46, corresponding
with the 25th of the month Safar Hijrı Year 1010 (Hindi S. Y 1658 Bhādrapad Vadi
12th-14th August 1601 A D )

Farmān of the Emperor Jalāl-ud-din Muhammad Akbar ordering prohibition
of animal-slaughter for additional 7 days from Āsādha Sukla 9th to 15th

request of Jinasımba Suri on the 31st Khurdād Ilāhı Year 49 of the accession
(1604 A. D.).
“Farmān of Jalālu-d-din Muhamınad Akbar Bādshā Gāzı
• Be it known to the exalted Governors, Jāgurdārs, Karoris, and all Alutasaddis
(administrators) of Multān Subah that it is our eternal desire that all men and animals
get happiness, whereby all people living peacefully and free from anxiety continue to
devote themselves to the contemplation of God Before this time, (our) well-wisher,
Jayacand (Jinacandra ) Kharatar had remained in our service presence), and when his
devotion to God became manifest, we made him to participate in our great royal favours
He prayed that before him Hilavijay Sūrı had the honour of having an audience and
requested that for twelve days every year, no animal should be killed in the Imperial
territories and none should harm any bırd, fish or other creaturas, his prayer had been
granted. He also hoped that for one week more a similar order be made for this
well-wisher.' Thereupon, we made the order by virtue of our general mercy that during
the days from Āsād Sukla ninth to Purnamāsı each year, no animal should be killed and
no man should harass any being The real point is this when God has created for a human
being things of various kinds, he should not harm any animal nou make his stomach the
grave of animals, but with some objects former intellectual men have prescribed in
that way At this time Achāıya Jinasınıh alias Mānsinh got an application made that
the fai mān which we had made 104 was lost, hence we have granted the new farmān in
accordance with the old farmān. It is required that the order should be put into force in
the same way as the document was given in waiting In this respect this should serve

of Bahman in the Ilāhı year 10, corresponding to Saturday, the 24th of the month of
Muharram-al-Harām, 1025 H (Feb 2, 1616), du mg the chauh2114 of him who is worthy
of favoui, mercy and kindness, Khwājā Ibrāhim Husain's, through the mediation of
Azamat Khānale, who is worthy of favour and kindness, and during the waqınavisi
of the slave of the court Abdul Wası, to this effect
Bikhe Harkhe (Vivekaharsa), Jayānand Jatı, the disciple of Bajidev (Vijayadeva)
Sūr and of Nandji ( Nandivijayajı ), appeared before the exalted and holy piesence in
the Ghusal Khānāli? on the 22nd of Dai Ilāhı year 10, and an order obeyed by the world
and brilliant like the sun was given that the Jatis who are Jains are virtuous and
have no other business except worship, Having carefully considered and weighed matters,
they (the officers) should not harm this class of persons so that they may be engaged
in worship with perfect peace of mind and may devote themselves to prayers for
the permanence of the everlasting Empire
Sharh (endorsement) In granting this request the exalted order was to the effect
that having carefully understood and weighed the fact that he Jatis aie a class of men
who are certainly virtuous, they should be left to themselves so that they are virtuous
and have no other business except worship. Having carefully considered and weighed
matters, they may devote themselves to worship and be engaged in prayers for the
permanence of the everlasting Empire Written in accordance with the Yad-dasht.
(Sharh of the Waqınavis is his own hand)
The above is correctly stated.
( Another Sharh in the hand of Jumlat-ul-Mulkı Madār-ul-Mahamı Itimad-ud-
Daulat | 118 Let it be submitted again
114 Chauhr means here the period of duty of the commandant of the mounted guard at the palace
Two officers, erz, the Mir'Arx and the commandant, were, day and night, in attendance
at the palace ready to execute any orders His Majesty may issue For Abul Fazl's account
of the rules about mounting guard, see Blochmann's Ain, I, 257 [vide also Akbarnāmā III
p 207]
115 This is probably the same Ibrahim Husain who is mentioned by Jabāngir in his lemoirs
as the Min Bahr and as the Bakhshi of the ahadıs (? Bakhshi of the Subah of the Descan)
and as one of his most trusted attendants ( Tro-uh-2-Jahāngira, trans by Rogers and
Beveridge, I, 149, 257–8)
116 Azamat Khān was one of Jahāngir's nobles who is mentioned in the lemoirs as having been
sent with 3,000 Rupees, during the Imperial stay at Ahmedābād in 1618, to the tomb of
Shaikh Ahmad Khattu at Sarkhej where the money was to be distributed imong the faqırs
and indigent people ( Tuzuh, 1, 432)
117 The term Ghusal Khānā, though it meant originally the royal bathroom, came to signify under
Jahāngır the private chamber in the palace adjoining the bath-room where the Diwan or
the Bakhshi and a few trusted nobles were admitted to see the Emperor transacting
state-business Shāh Jahān gave the chamber the name of Daulat Khāna-2-Khās (Ibn Hasan
The Cento al Structure of the Mughal Empre, 77-78)
118 This is no doubt the father of the famous Nur Jahān, who was at one time Vazır of
the Empire

(Sharh in the hand of Muqarrab-ul-Muqarrab-us-Sultānı Diyānat Khān119 to
the following effect) On the 22nd of Ardıbıhıst Ilāhı year 11, corresponding to Wednes-
day, the 24th Rabi-us-Sanı of the year (2), in the waqınavısı of Muhammad Husain
Khushnavis, it was again submitted and confirmed.
(Sharh in the hand of Jumlat-ul-Mulkı Madār-ul-Mahamı Itimad-ud-Daulah).
All the officers of Ahmadābād and the parganās were informed.
(Sharh in the hand of Jumlat-ul-Mulk)
Let the farmān be put in writing.
Written to all the officials of the realm.
[The small seals on the margins of the document read as follows (a) Dated the
15th of the month of Amardād, year 11 the servant Asaf Khān, and (6) Banmāli Rām
Rāi, the slave of Jabāngır, the country-conquering king]
[Notes-Jahāngir evidently held his court at Ajmer when, as stated on the
reverse of the Farmān, he gave the interview in the Ghusal Khānā on the 22nd of
the month of Dai in the tenth year of the reign (Feb. 2, 1616) to the leaders of the
Jaina religion. In the record for the tenth Julus year in the Tuzuk he says: 'On the
7th month of Dar, when I was coming from Pushkar and returning to Ajmer, on the
way forty-two wild pigs were taken' (Rogers and Beveridge, I, 304) He would thus
have arrived at Ajmer on the 22nd of the month of Dai. The Farmān itself is dated
the 22nd of Amardād in the eleventh year of the accession (July, 1616 ) which shows
that an interval of about six months elapsed between the recording of the order at
Ajmer in the Diary and the issue of the Farmān in its final form. This delay was partly
due, no doubt, to the Emperor's absence from his capital.
Vijayadeva Súri was the disciple of Vijayasena Sūri, who became the Pontiff of
the Tapā Gachha on the death of Hilavijaya Sūrı. He received dīkshā at Ahmedābād
in V S 1643 and became an Ācārya in V. S 1656. In V. S. 1674 (A. D 1618)
he waited on Jahāngir at Māndu Under the influence of his teaching, the Mahārāja
Jagatsingh of Udaipui prohibited fishing in the Pinchholā and Udayasāgar lakes, as
also the slaughter of animals on the anniversary days of his accession. Similarly,
under his advice, Jām Lākhā of Nawānagar, Rāo Kalyānmal of Idar and the Por-
tuguese at Div imposed restrictions on the slaughter of animals. He died at Unã in
Kathiawar in A. D 1657–8 ( Sur ushwara and Samrat, 384n, 385n). ]
[Reproduced with its footnotes and notes from K. B M S. Commissariat's
article entitled 'Imperial Mughal Farmāns in Gujarāt published in the Journal of the
University of Bombay Vol. IX, Part I July 1940 ].
119 Diyānat Khān is also mentioned in the Memorrs as a very trusted noble under Jahāngrı
(Tuzuk, I, 123, 260, 331)

Māndavgadh), I constantly inquire for the news about you, and am sure that you would

disciple Dayākusala Pannyāsa 120 presented himself before us, the news about you has been
learnt from him, we are (thereby) very much pleased Your disciple is also much
experienced and possessed of logical faculty We treat him with perfect kindness and
whatever he says is being done If there be any work here, you will write it to your
disciple (so that the same be known by us (directly through him) and the same will
receive our attention in every way You will remain free from anxiety from us and
will be engaged in praying for the permanence of our Kingdom by worshipping those
who are worthy to be worshipped Nothing more remains to be written. Written on the
19th of the month Shābān in the year 1027 (Saturday 1st August 1618 A D)
