SINGHI JAIN SERIES
[A Short History Of The Series ]
Babu S'ri Dalchandji Singhi, in whose sacred memory the present
Series is inaugurated by his son, Babu Sri Bahadur Singhji Singhi was
born in Azimganj (Murshidabad ) in the Vikrama Samyat 1921 ( 1865 A, D.),
and died in Calcutta on the 30th December, 1927. The Singhi family of
Azimganj occupies almost the foremost rank among the few hundred Jaina
families which migrated to Bengal from Rajputana in the latter part of the
17th century and took their domicile in the district of Murshidabad. The
family rose to its present position and prominence chiefly through the energy
and enterprise of that self-made man, Babu Dalchandji Singhi.
Owing to financial difficulties, Dalchandji Singhi had abruptly to cut
short his educational career and join the family business at the early age of
14. The family had been carrying on business in the name of Messrs
Hurisingh Nehalchand for a long time though, in those days, it was not at
all a prominent firm. But having taken the reins of the firm in his own
hands, Babu Dalchandji developed it on a very large scale; and it was
mainly through his business acumen, industry, perseverance and honesty that
this comparatively unknown firin of "Hurisingh Nehalchand" came to be
reckoned as the foremost jute concern with branches in almost all the impor.
tant jute centres of Bengal. The fruits of Dalchandji Singhi's toils were
immense, and the reputation of the firm in commercial circles was indeed
unique.
Having thus brought his jute business to the most flourishing condi-
tion, Babu Dalchandji Singhi diverted his attention to the mineral resources
of India and spent many lacs of rupees in prospecting the coal fields of Korea
State (C. P.), limestone deposits of Sakti State and Akaltara, and the bauxite
deposits of Belgaum and Sawantwadi and Ichalkaranji States. His scheme
for the Hiranyakeshi Hydro-Electric Project and manufacture of aluminium
from bauxite ores, the first of its kind in India, is yet to be developed. His
mining firm, Messrs Dalchand Bahadur Singh is reputed to be one of the
foremost colliery proprietors in India. While so engaged in manifold
business, he also acquired and possessed vast Zamindary estates spreading over
the districts of 24-Perganas, Rangpur, Purnea, Maldah, etc.
But the fame of Babu Dalchandji Singhi was not confined to his
unique position in commercial circles. He was equally well-known for his
libérality and large-heartedness, though he always fought shy of publicity
attached to charitable acts and often remained anonymous while feeding the
needy and patronizing the poor. A few instances of his liberality are
given below.
MEREU

Page 11****************************************************************************************
When Mahatma Gandhi personally visited his place in 1926, for a
contribution to the Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Babu Dalchandji Singhi gladly
handed over to him a purse of Rs. 10,000.
His War contribution consisted in his purchasing War Bonds to the
value of Rs. 3;00,000; and his contribution at the Red Cross Sales, held in
March 1917, under the patronage of H. E. Lord Carmichael on Government
House grounds, Calcutta, amounted to approximately Rs. 21,000, in which he
paid Rs. 10,000 for one bale of jute which he had himself contributed. His
anonymous donations are stated to have amounted to more than one lac of
rupees.
In his private life Babu Dalchandji Singhi was a man of extremely
simple and unostentatious habits. Plain living and high thinking was his
ideal. Although he had been denied a long academic career, his knowledge,
erudition and intellectual endowments were of a very high order indeed.
His private studies were vast and constant. His attitude towards life and the
world was intensely religious, and yet he held very liberal views and had
made a synthetic study of the teachings of all religions. He was also well-
versed in the Yoga darśana. During the latter part of his life he spent his
days mostly in pilgrimage and meditation. Noted throughout the district
and outside for his devoutness, kindness and piety, he is remembered even
now aş a pride of the Jaina community.
During the last days of his life, Babu Dalchandji Singhi cherished a
strong desire to do something towards encouraging research in important
works of Jaina literature and publishing their editions scientifically and
critically prepared by eminent scholars. But fate had decreed otherwise;
and before this purpose of his could become a reality, he expired.
However, Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi, worthy son of the worthy
father, in order to fulfil the noble wish of the late Dalchandji Singhi,
continued to help institutions like the Jaina Pustaka Pracăraka Mandala,
Agra; the Jaina Gurukula, Palitana; the Jaina Vidyābhavana, Udaipur, etc.;
and also patronized many individual scholars engaged in the publication of
Jaina literature. Besides, with a view to establishing an independent
memorial foundation to perpetuate the memory of his father, he consulted our
common friend, Pandit Sri Sukhlalji, Professor of Jainism in the Benares
Hindu University, an unrivalled scholar of Jaina Philosophy, who had also
come in close contact with the late Babu Dalchandji Singhi, and whom the
latter had always held in very high esteem. In the meanwhile, Babu Bahadur
Singhji Singhi incidentally met the late Poet, Rabindranath Tagore, and
learnt of his desire to get a chair of Jaina studies established in the Viśva-
Bhāratī, Santiniketan. Out of his respect for the Poet, Babu Sri Bahadur
Singhji readily agreed to found the chair (provisionally for three years) in
revered memory of his dear father, and invited me to take charge of the same.
I accepted the offer very willingly, and felt thankful for the opportunity of

spending even a few years in the cultural and inspiring atmosphere of
Visva-Bhāratī, the grand creation of the great Poet Rabindranath.
During the period of 10 years of my principalship of the Gujarat
Purătattva Mandir, Ahmedabad, and even before that period, I had begun
collecting materials of historical and philological importance, and of folk-lore
etc., which had been lying hidden in the great Jaina Bhandars of Patan,
Ahmedabad, Baroda, Cambay, etc. I induced my noble friend Babu Bahadur.
Singhji Singhi, also to start a Series which would publish works dealing with
the vast materials in my possession, and also with other allied important
Jaina texts and studies prepared on the most modern scientific methods.
Hence the inauguration of the present Singhi Jaina Series.
Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi is himself a great connoisseur and
patron of art and culture. He has an unbounded interest in creative
researches in antiquities, and has a very good collection of rare and historic
paintings, manuscripts, coins, books, and jewellery. On many occasions the
organisers of various exhibitions throughout India have had to call upon him
for loan of his art collection; and he has gladly responded to their requests
without fail. In 1931 he was the recipient of a gold medal from the Hindi
Sahitya Sammelan as a mark of appreciation of his unique collection. He is a
Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (London); a member of the Royal Asiatic
Society of Bengal, Bangīya Sāhitya Parişat, the Indian Research Institute,
and many other similar institutions. He is also one of the Founder-members
of the Bhāratiya Vidyā Bhavan, Bombay. He was one of the prominent
working members of the Executive body of the "All-India Exhibition of
Indian Architecture and Allied Arts and Crafts" held in Calcutta in
February, 1935.
Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi is a prominent leader of the
Swetambar Jaina community. He was elected President of the Jaina
Swetambar Conference held in Bombay in 1926. He is also connected
with many other Jaina conferences and institutions either as president,
patron or trustee.
Though thus a leading figure in the Jaina community, Babu Bahadur
Singhji Singhi has always maintained a truly national and non-sectarian spirit
and helped also many institutions which are outside the Jain fold. For
example, he has donated Rs. 12,500 for constructing a building at Allahabad
for the Hindi Sahitya Parishat. In fact his generosity knows no distinction
of caste or creed.
Really speaking, he does not in the least hanker after name and
fame even though he is a multi-millionaire and a big Zamindar, and even
though he is a man of superior intellect and energy. He is by nature
taciturn and a lover of solitude. Art and literature are the pursuits
of his choice. He is very fond of seeing and collecting rare and invaluable

Page 13****************************************************************************************
specimens of ancient sculpture, painting, coins, copperplates, inscriptions,
manuscripts etc. He spends all his spare time in seeing and examining
the rarities which he has collected in his room as well as in reading.
He is seldom seen outside and he rarely mixes with society and friendly
circles. Wealthy persons like himself usually have a number of fads and
hobbies such as seeing the games and races, visiting clubs, undertaking
pleasure trips etc., and they spend enormously over them, but Singhiji has
none of these habits. Even the managers of his colliery and zamindari travel
in first class while he, the master, travels mostly in the second class. Instead
of wasting money on such things, he spends large sums on collecting ancient
things and valuable curios and on the preservation and publication ofimportant
literature. Donations to institutions and charities to individuals are, by him,
for the most part given anonymously. I know it from my own experience that
these gifts, donations and charities reach a very high figure at the end of every
year. But he is so modest that on his being requested so often by me he
did not show the least inclination to part with the names and whereabouts
of the individuals and institutions that were the recipients of such financial
aid from him. By chance I came to know of a very recent example, just now,
indicative of this characteristic of his nature. Last year he shifted, like
other innumerable inhabitants of Calcutta, his headquarters to Azimganj
(Dist. Murshidabad) when the fear of the Japanese invasion was looming
large, and decided to stay there with his whole family during war time.
Taking into consideration the present grievous condition of the country as
well as the excessive scarcity of the grains in Bengal, he had stocked
grains in large quantities with a view to distributing them gratis according
to his capacity. Thereafter the problem of food became rather more serious
and at present the prices have risen inconceivably high. Babu Bahadur
Singhji Singhi could have earned four to five lacs of rupees if he had, like
many other miserly merchants, sold off the hoarded lot of grains, taking
undue advantage of the prevailing conditions. But he resisted the tempta.
tions, and has been daily distributing freely the grains among thousands of
poor people who shower blessings on him; and he enjoys a deep self-satisfa.
ction. This is the most recent example that puts us in adequate knowledge
of his silent munificence. Really he is a very silent and solid worker and he
has no desire to take active part in any controversies, social or political,
though he has sufficient fitness and energy to do so. Still however he is
skilful enough to do what is proper at the particular time. The following
incident will best illustrate this statement. It was in the fitness of things that
a wealthy multi-millionaire like him should give an appropriate contribution
in the war funds. With this view he arranged in the second week of
December, 1941, an attractive show, styled Singhi Park Mela in the garden
of his residential place at Calcutta in which all the local people and officers of
name and fame, including the Governor of Bengal, Sir John Arthur Herbert
and lady Herbert as well as the Commander-in-chief (now the Governot. :

Page 14****************************************************************************************
Vil
General) Viscount Wavell, had also taken part with enthusiasm. This show
fetched thousands of rupees which were considered substantial financial
help to the war funds.
The series was started, as mentioned above, in 1931 A. D. when I
worked as a Founder-Director of the Singhi Jain Chair in Viſvabhārati at
Shantiniketan, at Singhiji's request. It was, then, our aspiration to put the
Singhi Jain Chair and the Singhi Jain Series on a permanent basis and to
create a centre at Viſvabhārati for the the studies of Jain cult in deference
to the wishes of the late Poet Rabindranath Tagore. But unfortunately I
was forced to leave this very inspiring and holy place on account of
unfavourable climatic conditions etc. which I had to face during my stay
of about four years there. I shifted, therefore, from Viſvabhārati to
Ahmedabad where I had formerly resided and worked in those glorious
days when the Gujarat Vidyāpīth and the Purātattva Mandir had been
established as a part of the movement for national awakening and cultural
regeneration. I went there in the hope that the reminiscences of those
days and the proximity of those places would serve as sources of inspiration
in my literary pursuits.
In the intervening period the activity of the Purātattva Mandir
had languished and along with the arrest of its many scholar-workers
the vast, precious collection of books also was confiscated and placed
in custody by the British Government. After some years when it was
refurnedit layunadored, like images, without its worshippers in the
Mandir. My old friends and colleagues of the Purātattva Mandir and the
Vidyāpīth had, like myself, taken to different pursuits at different places.
When some of them, namely, Prof. R. C. Parikh (who is, at present, the
Director of the Postgraduate and Research Departments of the Gujarat
Vernacular Society, Ahmedabad), Prof. R. V. Pathak (who is, at present,
the Vice-Principal of the S. L. D. Arts College, Ahmedabad), Pandit
Sukhlalji (who is the Head of the Department of Jain Studies in the Hindu
University, at Benares) and myself occasionally met, we all revived our
old sweet memories of the Vidyāpīth and the Purātattva Mandir, and of
also the possibility of a regeneration of the Mandir or of the establishment
of another similar institution at Ahmedabad and enjoyed in dreaming dreams
of schemes of such institutions.
During this period my aim of life had centred round the Singhi
Jain Series and I devoted every iota of my energy to its development
and progress.
In June, 1938, I received, to my agreeable surprise, a letter from
Sri K. M. Munshi (who was, then, the Home Minister of the Congress.

[VII
Ministry of the Bombay Presidency), my esteemed friend and the originator
and the founder of the Bhāratīya Vidyā Bhavan. In that letter he had
mentioned that Sheth Sri Mungalal Goenka had placed a liberal sum of two
lacs of rupees at his disposal for the establishment of a good academic
institution for Indological studies and he had asked me to come down to
Bombay to discuss and prepare a scheme for that. Accordingly, I came here
and saw Munshiji. Knowing that he had a fervent desire of founding at
Bombay an institution of the type of the Purātattva Mandir, I was extremely
delighted and I showed my eagerness to offer for that such services as might
be possible for me. We, then, began to draft out a scheme and after
some deliberations and exchange of ideas the outline of the Bhāratiya Vidyā
Bhavan was settled. Accordingly, on the auspicious full-moon day of the
Kārttik of 1995 (V. S.) the opening ceremony of the Bhāratīya Vidyā
Bhavan took place amidst the clappings and rejoicings of a magnificent party
which was arranged at the residence of Munshiji. The Bhavan has completed
five years of its career on the last Kārttikī full-moon day. The brilliant
achievement and the wide publicity which the Bhavan has been able to
secure in this short period of five years, bear eloquent testimony to the
inexhaustible fund of energy and unsurpassed skill of Munshiji. As I am
inseparably linked up with it from the very conception, I also feel the same
amount of joy and interest at the Bhavan's progress as Sri Munshiji, its
Founder.President and therefore I have been always offering my humble
services in its various undertakings and activities.
On the other hand, the Singhi Jain Series is the principal aim
of my remaining life and the results of my thinking, meditation, researches
and writings have all been devoted to the development of the Series. As life
passes on, the time of activity is also naturally shortened and therefore it is
quite appropriate, now, for me to chalk out lines of its future programme and
permanence.
As Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi, the noble founder and the sole
patron of the Series, has placed the whole responsibility of the Series on me
from its inception, he has also the right to expect that more and more works
may more speedily and splendidly be published. I have neither seen nor come
across any other gentleman who can match with him as regards generosity
and unbounded zeal for the revival of ancient literature. On the works of
the Series he has spent through me more than 50,000 rupees till now.
But he has not even once asked me, during this long period of a dozen
years, as to how and for what works the amount was spent. Whenever
the account was submitted to him, he did not ask for even the least information
and sanctioned it casting merely a formal glance on the account sheets.
But he discussed very minutely the details regarding things such as the paper,
types, printing, binding, get-up, etc. as well as internal subjects like Preface
and others, and occasionally gives very useful suggetrions thereon with deep

interest. His only desire being to see the publication of as many works
as possible in his life-time, he is always ready to spend as much, after it, as
required. He does not labour under a delusion that the things should be
done in this or that way when he is no more.
As these were his ideas and desires concerning the Series and as every
day that passes leaves me all the more convinced of the fickleness of my
advanced life too, it was imperative for us to draw out a scheme for its future
programme and management. Just at this time a desire dawned in the heart
of S'rī Munshiji, to the effect that if the Singhi Jain Series be associated with
the Bhāratīya Vidya Bhavan, both the institutions would not only be admirably
progressing but the Series would get permanence and the Bhavan, unique
honour and fame by its hereby becoming an important centre for the studies
of Jain culture and the publication of Jain literature. This well-intentioned
desire of Munshiji was much liked by me and I conveyed it in a proper form
to Singhiji who is, besides being a Founder-Member of the Bhavan, also
an intimate friend of Munshiji since long. Eventually he welcomed this
idea of Munshiji. I also came to a final decision of associating the Series with
the Bhayan, having consulted my most sincere friend, life-long companion
and co-worker, Pt. Sukhlalji, who is a well-wisher and an active inspirer
of the Series, and who is also an esteemed friend of Babu Bahadur Singhji.
Luckily we all four met in Bombay in the bright half of the last Vaišākh
and on one auspicious day we all sat together and unanimously resolved,
at the residence of Munshiji, to entrust the Series to the Bhavan.
According to that resolution, the publication of the Series is now
under the management of the Bhāratīya Vidyā Bhavan and the office of the
Series is also permanently located in the building of the Bhavan.
In addition to transferring all sorts of copyright of the Series,
Singhiji has also donated a liberal sum of Rs. 10,000 which will be spent on
erecting a hall, to be named after him, in a prominent place in the Bhavan.
In appreciation of this generous donation of Singhiji, the Bhavan has also
resolved to style permanently the Department of Jain Studies as the “Singhi
Jain Sastra Sikşāpīth”,
Thus the Singhi Jain Series, which is the fruit of the enlightened
liberality of Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi, is flourishing under the manage-
ment of the Bhāratīya Vidyā Bhavan and contributing to the advancement of
Atresiter faren - Indological Studies - in all their aspects.

PREFACE
ALMOST from childhood, I had an aptitude for hearing and knowing the
A Purānic and Epic stories. When I was fourteen-fifteen, and could
read a bit, I became a pupil of a monk of the Sthanakavāsi sect of the
Jaina Svetāmbara community. Born in a Rājput family devoted to Siva and
Vişnu, and brought up under the influence of Hindu sarskāras in my
childhood, quite instinctively I looked upon Rāma and Krşņa as the divinity
and addressed Śiva as the Parameśvara. A gradual change came on me after
my becoming a Jaina monk. The monks, according to their religious prescri-
ptions, visit different places and preach religious and ethical principles to
their audience by narrating stories. The Jainas in villages are not quite
conversant with the ideology and principles of their religion; and ordinarily
they are accustomed to listen to the various topics of the Mahābhārata,
Rāmāyaṇa, Bhāgavata etc. which are commonly popular with the orthodox
Hindu community. Being a minor community, the Jainas, on many occasions,
it is quite natural, are influenced by the saṁskāras and ideas of the other
Hindus who form an overwhelmingly majority community with dominating
social position. To guard against such an influence and to confirm them in
the Jaina faith, the Jaina monks often criticise the inconsistent and unnatural
details of the Purāņas, Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa etc. in the presence of their
Srāvakas whom they want to convince about the hollowness of Vedic and
Purāņic tales and whose faith in Jainism they want to nourish by didactic tales
and religious sermons. Literary example, as we know, is a powerful instru-
ment for the moulding of character. To impress on the mind of the masses the
specific ethical and religious principles, the religious teachers and preachers,
all over the world and from times immemorial, have used the legends and tales
which provide the hearers with examples and principles which they can easily
follow. The Jaina monks are in no way an exception.
After attending such sermons of Jaina monks, my instinctive inclinations
were being gradually changed, and my attachment for Jaina traditions and
tales became deeper and deeper. As a rule, the Sthānakavāsi monks possessed
no liking, worth noting, for the study of any branch of literature. They were
least acquainted with Sanskrit and Prākrit languages, nor did they care
to study them. They had, consequently, no idea of the vast and varied
heritage of Jaina literature enriched by the remarkable contributions of
eminent Svetāmbara and Digambara authors. At the most, they were con-
versant with and repeatedly read a few late, vernacular texts such as Dhäl.com
sāgara and Dhanyasālibhadra-caüpāi which are of quite ordinary merits. After

DHŪRTĀKHYANA:
reading a couple of such texts, my desire for reading many more such stories
went on increasing, but they were not then available to me.
A couple of years after my initiation into the order, I happened to go to
Ujjain with my teacher and other brother monks. In the Dharma-sthānaka there,
among the Sāstras collected by the ancestor monks of my teacher, I chanced to
see certain Mss. of Bālāvabodha paraphrases on some Sūtras and Kathānakas.
It was for the first time in my life that I saw there the Mss. of the Bhuvanabhānu-
carita-Balavabodha and Dhūrtākhyāna-Balāvabodha. At that stage I could not
read their script, nor could I understand their language, with ease ; still, after
strenuous efforts and repeated reading, I could manage to grasp the contents
of the Bhuvanabhānucarita-Bālāvabodha. I liked it immensely, and I men-
tioned it to my Teacher. He grew angry with me; he at once snatched away
the Ms. from me, and quietly put it in the box as before. I came to know,
later on, that my Teacher had heard that the Carita contained references to
the worship of Jaina temples and of images of Jina: of course, my Teacher had
never read it himself. His intention was that a raw mind like that of myself
should not be influenced by such stories that did not conform to the accepted
creed of the Sthānakavāsi Sampradāya. Fascinated by its very title, he,
however, kept with himself and began reading the Dhūrtākhyāna-Bālāvabodha.
He finished it in a couple of days, and also recommended it to me that
it contained nice stories which are quite useful for sermons. He had read
it for the first time; and under his advice I began to read it zealously and
respectfully. I read it so often, and mastered its contents so thoroughly, as if
it was a text book for some examination. The Ms. furnished no details
about its author and date; nor did I possess any curiosity to know these things
at that time: my mental horizon was not wide enough for such an enquiry.
When we left that place after the Cāturmāsa, the Ms. was put in its box;
that must be, if I remember right, during the rainy season of 1905. That is
how, quite indirectly and accidentally, I came to be acquainted, during my
student-life, with the Dhūrtākhyāna of Haribhadra.
Later on, after some 8 or 10 years, as a monk of the Svetāmbara Mūrti-
pūjaka Sampradāya, I had the good fortune of inspecting the Jaina Bhaņdāra
at Patan. In the meantime I studied Sanskrit and Prākrit; and my zest for
perviewing the rich and varied range of Jaina literature was increasing. The
Mss. on which the present edition of the Dhūrtākhyāna is based were first seen
by me at this time. After studying more about the work and its authors, I
desired that this work should be printed and published. When this desire occur-
red to me, I never dreamt, being quite aware of my ability then, that some
day in the future I would have the opportunity of editing it. After some
more years of study my mastery of Prākrit increased; and at the suggestion
of my scholar-friend, the late lamented C. D. Dalal, the original organiser
of the Gaikwad Oriental Series, I began to edit the Kumārapāla-pratibodha of
Somaprabhācārya for that Series from a single palm-leaf Ms. found in the Pātan

Bhaņdāra. Since then I earnestly hoped for an opportunity to edit the
Dhūrtākhyāna.
It was in 1931, at Santiniketana, that the idea of the Singhi Jaina
Granthamālā was conceived; and along with many other Sanskrit and Prākrit
works, I decided to include the Dhūrtākhyāna also in the Mālā. The Mss. of it,
seen by me many years back at Pātan, were procured; and the press copy was
prepared. But as my hands were fully occupied with many a book in the
press, its printing could not be begun till as late as 1941. The Pātan Mss. were
lying with me for years together; and when the eminent organiser of the
Pātan Bhandāras, Munirāj Šrī Punyavijayaji, specially pressed me to return the
Mss., the happy moment of beginning its printing arrived. Consequently, today
I feel happy to see that I am able to present this work to the scholarly world
as the 19th volume of the Singhĩ Jaina Granthamālā.
My original plan was to present the Prākrit text, to give a Hindi or
Gujarāti translation, and to reproduce, in an appendix, the various relevant
extracts from the Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa and Purāņas. In fact, some excer-
pts were collected too. In the meanwhile, an old and independent Ms. of
Sanghatilaka's Sanskrit Version of the Dhūrtākhyāna also was found at Pātan;
and I was tempted to include that also in this edition. When the Prākrit and
Sanskrit texts were printed, I learnt that there is a Ms. of the Gujarāti
Bālāvabodha of the Dhū. in the Govt. Collection of Mss. deposited at the
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona. I got the Ms. and inspected
it. Finding that the study of its language would be of special importance in
grasping the earlier phases of Gujarāti and western Rājasthānī, I thought it
proper to put that also in this Volume. Thus we have, in this edition, the
critical text of the original Prākrit Dhūrtākhyāna of Haribhadrasūri of the
8th century, then the metrical Sanskrit version of the same by Sanghatilaka of
the 15th century, and also an anonymous rendering in the Lokabhāṣā of the
16th or 17th century,
I intended in the beginning to write an Introduction in Hindi or
Gujarāti, giving some details about Haribhadra's date and the contents of this
work. But when I learnt that this book was prescribed by the University of
Bombay in the B. A. course for Ardhamāgadhī, I thought that the edition
should contain a thorough study of the work for the benefit of students for
whom it was being prescribed. With this idea in mind, I requested my
learned friend Dr. A. N, Upadhye, whose study in this connection is both deep
and wide, to contribute a critical essay on the Dhūrtākhyāna for this
volume. In connection with his original paper on the Apabhramsa Dharma-
pariksā which was submitted to the All-India Oriental Conference, Hyderabad,
and of which he sent to me an advance copy, he had already made a close study
of the Dhūrtākhyāna, It was very kind of him that he willingly and
readily acceeded to my request. Though he was occupied with editing
various important works, within a comparatively short time, he sent to me

DHURTĀKHYANA :
quite an original, thorough, critical and elaborate Essay on the Dhūrtākhyāna
which forms a most important and valuable part of this volume. In his
learned dissertation, Dr. Upadhye has made a searching study of the different
aspects of the Dhūrtākhyāna with remarkable penetration and judiciousness.
I am not aware of any such substantial contribution on this subject by any
other scholar.
Dr. Upadhye has not, however, discussed in his essay any details about
the life, date, and works of Haribhadrasūri; he left them to me. Some
twenty-five years back, the date of Haribhadrasūri had become a point for
difference of opinion and dispute between European and Indian scholars.
After reaching a decision in this matter, in the light of various fresh materials,
especially the specific reference in the Kuvalayamālā of Uddyotanasūri, I
presented to the First All-India Oriental Conference, Poona (1919), an essay in
Sanskrit, 'Haribhadrācāryasya Samaya-nirnayah' in which I definitely proved
that Haribhadra flourished at the close of the 8th century and at the beginning
of the 9th century of the Vikrama era. That great German Orientalist, the
late lamented Dr. Hermann Jacobi, had discussed this topic thoroughly and with
remarkable originality; and he could be looked upon as an authority on the
subject. When he read my paper, with typical impartiality he relinquished
his earlier view and wholly accepted my conclusion; and that was a great
encouragement to me. In the Introduction to his monumental edition of the
Samarāiccakahā, published in the Bibliotheca Indica, No. 169, Asiatic Society of
Bengal, 1926, he has presented a valuable and learned discussion about the
date, life and works of Haribhadrasūri; and therein he has accepted the date
of Haribhadra proposed by me and stated the same as an indisputable fact.
I am not aware of any other article than this which concisely presents the
requisite details about Haribhadra : his date, life and works. The time lias
not come to add anything specially new; so I thought it proper to give in this
Volume the relevant portion of Dr. Jacobi's Introduction of the Samarāiccakahā.

These two Mss. mention neither the name of the writer nor the date of

been written at the close of the 16th century of the Vikrama era.
C = Besides the two above Mss., I got a modern Ms. from the Jňāna

Pātan, described above. The copyist has not rightly understood the
old script; and he has often written for 4, q for T, #for #, # for. 97.
With such mistakes the text has become quite corrupt. The readings of
this Ms. were not thought to be necessary, and hence they are not
recorded.

A = This belongs to the Samgha Bhaņdāra, Pātan. It contains 7 folios. It
is quite old, and perhaps belongs to the close of the 16th century of the
Vikrama era. In some places it shows corrections. A print of the
halftone block of its last page is given herewith.
B = It is a modern Ms. from the Baroda Bhaņdāra; some of its various

altogether omitted the numbering of the concluding verses on the last
two pages.

An appreciation and opinion of
Dr. MANOMOHAN GHOSH, M.A., Ph. D., "Kāvyatīrtha'
Lecturer in Skt., Pkt., and Modern Indian Languages,
Post. Graduate Department, Calcutta University.
Among the many series of works on the culture of ancient
and medieval India published during the last few years, the
Singhi Jain Series occupies a very prominent place. Dealing
mainly with varied Jain texts of which the general students of
Indian History up till now have no clear idea but which can in
many ways supplement their fragmentary knowledge of different
aspects of the cultural life of pre-modern India, this series
should be reckoned as one of the most important contributions to
Indological studies of our times. Sixteen volumes which have
been published in the series during its brief existence of
thirteen years include no less than fourteen texts and two tran-
slations. It is a pleasure to see that these texts edited with
great diligence and the most careful scholarship belong to
varying subjects like history, biography, logic, philosophy,
poetry and folk-tales etc. Acarya Sri Jinavijaya Muniji whose
name is a guarantee to the worth and accuracy of any publication,
be it in Sanskrit, Prakrit or Apabhramsa or similar language, is
the general editor of the series and is mainly responsible for
its remarkable success. Hence it is needless to discuss in-
dividually the merits of works published. Of the published
works no less than seven have been edited by Muni Sri Jina-
vijayaji himself and among his colleagues he has wellknown and
able scholars like Pandit Sukhlalji and Dr. A. N. Upadhye, who
have edited some of the publications in the series.
A review of the names of more than forty works which are
either in the press or under preparation for the series will
convince any student of Indology of the various aspects of its
worth and usefulness. The excellent printing and get up of the
volumes already published very pleasantly turn our attention
to the princely munificence of Sriman Bahadur Singh Singhi of
Calcutta and Murshidabad (Bengal) who founded the series in
memory of his late father Shri Dalchandji Singhi. The general
editor as well as the founder of the series are to be very sin-
cerely congratulated on their highly valuable publications.
It is our very earnest wish that the series may continue un-
interruptedly with uniform success.

HARIBHADRA'S AGE, LIFE AND WORKS
BY
Dr. HERMANN JACOBI
1. Haribhadra's Age.
The death of Haribhadra, the author of the Samarāicca-Kahā, is placed by Jaina
tradition, which in this particular can be traced to the beginning of the 13th century A. D., in
Vikrama samvat 585 or Vīra samvat 1055, corresponding to 529 A, D.This date, however,
was recognised to be wrong,? since Haribhadra was acquainted with the philosophy of
Dharmakirti who flourished about 650 A. D. The discussion at that time turned on the
following point. Siddharși who finished the Upamitibhavaprapañcā Kathā on the 1st May,
906 A. D., calls, in the Pras'asti of that work, Haribhadra his dharmabodhakaro guruh.
Now the question arose whether Haribhadra was actually Siddharsi's teacher of the Sacred
Law, or his Paramparāguru; in this investigation I took what eventually turned out the
wrong side of the question. Meanwhile the Jainas had been publishing a number of Hari.
bhadra's works which were found to contain many interesting details. But the evidence
that finally settled the question of Haribhadra's age, was not furnished by any of his own
works, but by the Kuvalayamālā, a Prākrit poem by Uddyotana, which he finished on the
last day but one of the S'aka year 700,5 equal to the 21st March, 779 A. D. In the Pras'asti of
1 At the end of an old MS. in Jesulmer of Haribhadra's Laghukşetrasamāsavrtti the
date of the completion of this work is given in two verses as Vikrama 585, Jyestha
su-di 5, Friday, Puşya nakṣatra; this corresponds to either Tuesday, 9th May 528
A.D., or Saturday, 28th April 529 A.D. In the first case the nakṣatra was Pusya,
in the second Punarvasu. As the week-day comes out wrong in both cases, the
date must be considered spurious. The nakṣatra carries less weight, because for
every day of the lunar year the choice generally lies between three nakṣatras only
which may be ascertained beforehand.

4 A full statement of all particulars about Haribhadra's works, their commentators and
the latters' dates is furnished by Muni Kalyānavijaya in the preface (granthakārda
paricaya) to his edition of Haribhadra's Dharmasangrahiņi, Devendra Lalbhal's
Jainapustakoddbāra No. 42, Bombay, 1918.
5 aleg fattat UEUFE i. e. Caitra ba-di 14. This date is interesting from the point
of view of the calendar. As the Caitrādi-year invariably begins with the Suklapaksa
of Caitra, the date in question would seem to be recorded acoording to the pūrnimānta
scheme in which the dark fortnight precedes the bright one. But as Kielhorn (Ind.
Ant. 1896 p. 271 f) has shown from dates in inscriptions that in connection with Sak&
years almost always amānta months are used, the primā faciē interpretation of our
date becomes extremely doubtful. In the year under consideration however there
was an adhika Caitre which precedes the nija month; therefore in this case adhika
Caitra ba-di 14 is the last day but one of the preceding year, if the year began with
nija Caitra, as it ought to do, since the new moon initiating true Caitra immediately
preceded by Meşasaņkrānti. I, therefore, believe that Swamikannu Pillai's assertion
(Indian Ephemeris Vol. I, part I, p. 66 ), "when there is an adhika Caitra that begins
the year", applios only to modern usage.

HARIBHADRA:
his work Uddyotana mentions Haribhadra as his teacher in philosophy, praising him as the
author of a great many books; the latter statement puts it beyond doubt that the great
Haribhadra is the person intended. The first who rightly understood the passage in question
and recognised its chronological bearing, was Munirāj Shrī Jinavijaya. In his article "The
date of Haribhadrasūri," read at the First Oriental Conference, November 1919, Poona, and
published under the title "S'ri Haribhadrācāryasya Samayanirnayah" in the Jaina Sāhitya-
sams'odhaka Granthamālā, Poona, he discusses the whole question, examines the evidence,
and puts his case in the clearest light. The following remarks are chiefly based on his paper.
We cannot make out from Uddyotana's remark whether Haribhadra was still alive
or not, when it was written; some twenty or thirty years before that date, however, he must
have been actually teaching Uddyotana. We may, therefore, take that epoch, say, 750 A. D.
or later, as the time of his literary activity, which considering the extraordinary number of
prakaranas he wrote must have extended over twenty years at least. He quotes many
authors, Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Jaina; a list of them containing thirty names has been
drawn up by Jinavijaya, 1. c., p. 11. From among them the following may be mentioned as
interesting from a chronological point of view: Dignāga, Dharmakīrti, Bhartrhari (author of
the Vākyapadīya, about 650 A. D.), and Kumārila. Haribhadra quotes, in his Vivarana of
the Nandīsūtra, several passages from the Cūrni of that Sūtra by Jinadāsagani-mahattara
without mentioning his name. The Cümni was finished in the S'aka-year 598=677 A. D. To
about the same time belongs Siddhasenadivākara whom Haribhadra quotes; for he uses, no
doubt, Dharmakīrti, though he does not name him. We thus see that Haribhadra quoted
many of the celebrities who flourished in the century preceding his own. On the other hand
he does not quote S'ankara who rose so high above all his contemporaries that Haribhadra
could not have ignored him if he bad lived at or after his time. We, therefore, conclude that
the tradition of Sankara's school is right, or at least not far wrong, in placing his life in
788-820 A. D. Nor does Haribhadra, as Jinavijaya states (1. c., p. 13), discuss the Māyā-
vāda. He knows the Advaita vāda, and refutes two or three different branches of it in his
S'astravārttāsamuccaya VIII, 1 ff,3 but none of them can be identified with the Māyāvāda.
1 The passage in which Haribhadra is referred to is corrupt as is shown by the metre.
In the MS. of the Deccan College, the only one that seems to be available, it runs
thus: at FASHUE CHTTAIGT STEHT ERHET TETITYTTTTTTEAT Il Munirāj Jinavijaya has
satisfactorily emended the text and supplied the missing syllables as follows: et
feat TK; TA191919 T FTET RETI I JETESHTIYEFHTIETEETAT The first pāda is
connected with the preceding verse which eulogises Uddyotana's teacher Vira-
bhadra; and the following perse names his father Vateśvara who was a Ksatriya
and became a Kşamāśramana. [It is interesting to note that my emendations have
been lately confirmed by the readings of the Jessalmer Ms. - Jinavijaya. 1
2 Dharmakirti qualifies pratyakşa as abhrānta (and Dharmottara expressly says
bhrāntam hy anumānang while Siddhasenadivākara in Nyāyāvatāra 5 ff claims
abhrāntatā for pratyaksa as well as anumāna; similarly he extends the distinction of
svārtha and parārtha, which properly applies to anumána only, to pratyaksa also,
ibidem 12 f. Apparently he thought to improve on Dharmakirti by a wholesale
generalisation of nice distinctions! He is different from Siddhasenagani the author
of the Tattvārtha-vrtti, because the latter quotes ad. II 25 from Haribhadra's
commentary on the Nandīsūtra, see Kalyāņavijaya, 1. C., p. 29; Haribhadra, therefore,
intervenes between both Siddhasenas. It may be mentioned that the younger one
quotes ad. I, 10. a verse by Arya-Siddhasena, who may or may not be Siddhasena-
dirākara.
3. We should like to know more details about these early Vedānta schcols than
Haribhadra gives in the work quoted in the text; perhaps he may have given
thom in his svopajña-vrtti to the passage in question. But the vitti is not
available to me.

HIS AGE, LIFA AND WORKS
[ XVII
This fact is of considerable interest, since it proves that before S'ankara the Māyīvāda was
practically unknown outside of the circles of Aupanişadas; for it had already been established
by Gaudapāda, the guru of Sankara's guru. It is not the intrinsic value of a systein, or
the originality of its teachings, that secured it notoriety throughout India, unless a great
author and debator takes it up, systematically developes it in every detail, and successfully
upholds it against all opponents. His fame then outshines that of the original thinker whose
merit was apt to be overlooked.
2. Haribhadra's Life.
We know very little about Haribhadra from himself; all that he chooses to tell us is
contained in the subscriptions to his numerous works. Froin them we collect the following
information: (1) he obeyed the command of Jinabhata, an ācārya of the Sitāmbaras (S'vetā-
mbaras ); (2) he was the pupil of Ācārya Jinadatta, an ornament of the Vidyādhara kula
(gaccha ); (3) he was a spiritual son of the nun Yakinīmahattarā".
Some more facts are directly manifested by the works of Haribhadra : (4) the use,
in the last verse of most of his works, of the word viraha, which may have reference to some
event in his life; (5) his intimate knowledge not only of Jainism, but also of the teachings
of the heterodox systems, evinced in his Anekāntajayapatākā and his Tikă of this work,
as well as by his writing a commentary on Dignāga's Nyāyapraves'a ; ( 6 ) his writing a
great number of works.
2. It goes without saying that the contemporaries of Haribhadra knew a great deal
more about his life than is contained in the above six items, but it is equally true that in oral
tradition sober history is apt to be gradually changed into legend, a strange mixture of facts
and fiction, which we can separate from each other with some degree of plausibility only in
the simplest cases. Occasionally, however, tradition has stories of an entirely fictitious kind
and originally unconnected with its hero. Thus, in the case in hand, curiosity was naturally
excited, by point (4), to satisfy which a tale full of miraculous and wholly incredible
incidents is added in the legendary life of Haribhadra; it exceeds in length all remaining
parts of the legends taken together; but no reference to it is made in the oldest accounts.
Before analysing the traditions about Haribhadra's life, I enumerate the sources
from which it is known.
(a) A short paragraph at the end of Municandra's Tikā of Haribhadra's Upades'a-
padāni; this Tīkā was finished in Vikrama Samvat 1174=1118 A. D.; the passage in question
has been printed by Kalyāyavijaya l. c. p. 5a and Jinavijaya l. c. p. 4, note 14.
(6) Eight gāthās ( 52–59 ) in Jinadatta's Ganadharasārdhas'ataka, written between
Samvat 1169 and 1211=1112-1154 A, D. The text is edited in A. Weber, Verzeichniss der
Sanskrit-und Prākrit-Handschriften, II p. 982 f.
(c) The ninth Srniga of Prabliācandra's Prabhāvakacarita, finished Samvat
1334=1278 A. D. (the name of the author is wrongly given as Candraprabha on the title of
the N. S. edition, 1909).
1 Thus the Dhvani-theory also seems to have been ignored until Anandavardhana
composed the Dhvanyāloka, the commentary on the original treatise in Kārikās
by an unknown author, and thereby brought this theory to such prominence,
that nearly all later writers on Alamkāra have adopted it. I am, therefore,
also persuaded that nihilistic and idealistic teachings which did exist in early
Buddhism passed unnoticed by, and did not provoke the opposition, of Brahmanical
philosophers until Nāgārjuna did for the Sūnyavāda and Vasubandhu for the
Vijiānavāda, what long after them Sankara has done for the Māyāvāda.
2 All the details stated above are given in the subscription of the Sisyahità, bis
Țikā of the Ayasyakasūtra ; in other places only one or other detail is mentioned.

HARIBHADRA:
(d) Rājas'ekhara's Prabandhakos'a, written in samvat 1405=1349 A. D. I know
only some extracts of this work given by Kalyānavijaya l. c. 1. Sa, 24a.
(e) Sumatigani's Vitti of the Ganadharasārdha-s'ataka ( see 6 ) finished samvat
1295=1239 A. D., occasionally referred to by Kalyāṇavijaya. An abridgement of Sumatigani's
narrative is given in the Laghuvitti of Sarvarājagaại, see A. Weber, l. c. p. 988.
(f) Kathāvali of Bhadres' vara, date unknown; mentioned by Jinavijaya and not
otherwise known to me.
I shall now diseuss some traditions about particulars of Haribhadra's lifa which may
be regarded as substantially true.
The birth place of Haribhadra was, according to ac, d, e, Citraküta, the modern
Chitor. The ancient fort on the crest of the hill' was the capital of Mewar from about the
7th century till 1569 Then the soat of government was moved to Udaipur. Haribhadra
probably lived in Chitor up to his initiation. But the scene of his later life as a monk seems
to have been chiefly the neighbouring parts of Rajputānā and the kingdom of Guzerat. In
that country, he became the teacher of Uddyotana”. Another indication of Haribhadra's
activity in Guzerat is furnished by the annals of Jaina families; for according to Kalyānavijaya
(1. c. p. 7b) they assert that Haribhadra organised the clan of the Porevals ( Poruvāda,
Prāgvāta ) and converted them to Jainism. Now we learn from the Nemināhacarius that the
Poreval clan originated in S'rīmāla,4 that a warlike member of this clan Nimaya, was
induced by Vanarāja ( 746-806 A. D.) to settle in his new capital Anahillapāta ka, and that
he there erected a temple of Rşabha for the Vidyādhara-gaccha. Since Haribhadra, the
organiser of the Poreval clan, belonged to the Vidyādharagaccha, it is likely that that clan
owed some sort of allegiance to that gaccha, whereof the statement in the Neminālacariu
seems to furnish a proof. Although Haribhadra may have lived for the greater part of his
life in Guzerat and the adjoining States of Rājputānā, yet his wanderings as a Yati probably
extended to far distant parts of India. Some hints about his knowledge of India may be
gathered from the Samarāiccakahā. In this regard it is significant that he does not lay the
scene of any of his tales in one of the renowned towns of the Deccan or Southern India, but
all towns that can be identified? are situated in Northern India, from Hastināpura to
Tāmralipta. He evinces a more intimate acquaintance with Eastern India between Ayodhyā
1 The phrase in e: S'rīcitrakūtācalacalūnivasino clearly refers to the ancient town
on the hill.
2 The verses 4 and 6 in the passage quoted from the Kuvalayamala by Jinavijaya
(1. c. p. 15) prove that Uddyotana belonged to a line of yatis that flourished
in Guzerat.
3 See xy edition of the 'Sanatkumāracaritam' in the Abhandlungen der Bayerischen
Akademie der Wissenschalten, Munchen, 1921, p. 152, der Bayerischen Arademie
der Wissenschaften, Munchen, 192 1, p. 152, VIII-V, and the additional note
on p. VI ib.
The modern Bhinmāl in the extreme south of Mārvād. Udd yotanasūri
names the town Siribhillamāla. It was the capital of Guzerat before the foundation
of Anahillapātaka by Vanarāja, the first of the Capotkata or Cāvadā kings.
For he calls his teacher Jinadatta an ornament of the Vidyādharagaccha. According
to the Harshanandanagani (1616 A, D.) he was a member of Viddhagaccha,
see Kalyāņavijaya. 1. o. p. 11b.
6 The cause of his want of acquaintance with Peninsular India vas probably the
circumstance that in his time there were few, if any, Svetāmbara communities
south of the Tapti.
Those in the fabulous country of Aparavideha, of course, do not concern us.

HIS AGE, LIFE AND WORKS

and Campā; in these countries Buddhism was still flourishing, and it is, therefore, possible
that Haribhadra there acquired his accurate knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, especially
as taught by Dignāga and Dharmakirti.
That Haribhadra was a Brahman by caste is stated in e7 and implied in c, where
he is said to have been the purohita of King Jitāri." Though there is no such statement in
C and 1, I have no doubt that it is true. For the learning peculiar to Haribhadra, apart
from his comprehensive knowledge of Jaina Lore, is of such a kind as was natural with a
Bralum0612, but quite exceptional in any other case, before Jain literature had received a new
impulse from brahmanical science. Municandra (e) truly describes Haribhadra as one who
had studied the eight grammarians, and was the leader of those whose understanding is
hardened by the discussions connected with all philosophical systems. It is chiefly due to
Haribhadra, as will be explained in the next paragraph, that Sanskrit became the learned
language of the S'vetāmbaras and replaced Prakrit in several departments of their literature;
he would, however, not have had this influence unless he was a perfect master of Sanskrit,
2.11 accomplishment which required the customary training of the Brahmann. And as
regards his mastery in philosophical discussion conducted in Sanskrit it is such that his
Anekāntajaya patākā with Tikā favourably compares with any philosophical work of the
same age. It may be added that the story of Haribhadra's conversion, the main features of
which are already contained in our oldest source (c), points also to the same conclusion,
that he was a Brahman by caste.
Haribhadra by acknowledging the nun Yäkini as his spiritual mother (charmato
Yakinīmalattartisūnu) unmistakably ascribes to her his conversion to the true faith',
which may be regarded as a second birth. How his conversion was brought about, has been
recorded by tradition which, in this regard, is probably substantially trustworthy. I shall
first give an abstract of the narrative about this part of Haribhadra's life in the Prabhāvaka-
carita (IX, V. 4-47), and discuss it afterwards.
Haribhadra was purohita of King Jitāri in the town of Citrakūta. He was so
proud of his knowledge, that he proclaimed that he would become the pupil of anyone whose
proposition he could not understand, and this vow was engraved on a golden plate he wore
on his belly (11). Once a most elephant having got loose and causing great havoc in the
streets, Haribhadra fled before him and made his escape by climbing on a Jain temple.
Thence he perceived the image of a Tirthakara whom he derided in a 'sloka (vapur eva
tavā caste, etc.) (18). On the next day when he went home about midnight, he heard an
old nun reciting a gāthā* (całkidugam Haripanagam, etc.), which utterly baffled liis
understanding. He asked her to explain its meaning, but she referred him to her guru
(27). So he went to see him on the next morning. Passing on his way by the same
temple he pronounced the same s'loka (vapur cua trovci caste ) changing one word so that it
redounded to a praise of Jina. There he saw Jinabhațasūri who promised to teach him after
he had been initiated. Haribhadra consented, and acknowledged malcittarú Jākini as his
ROUSER

2 Apparently a fictitious name standing for Jitaśatru, the usual name of the king
in countless legends and stories of the Jainas, but never met with, as far as I know,
in any historical document, inscription etc. The name is absent in the list of
Guhila kings of Mewad, see Mabel Duff, Chronology of India p. 282.
3 It is true that the Buddhists possessed many other older works of a similar
description but the Buddhists had come into contact with Brahminioal schools
of philosophy at a much earlier time, and many of their great writers have
notoriously been Brahmaris by caste.

HARIBHADRA :
spiritual mother (42). Ho became so well versed in the sacred Lore of the Jainas, and his
conduct was such that the gurul appointed him his successor. Thus Haribhadra became a
Yugapruchāna ( 47).
Now all essential points in this account are confirmed by Municandra in the short
passage? referred to above, with the exception of the incident of the mast elephant (v. 12-18)
and, as said before, of his being the purohita of King Jitāri. There the same gathā and the
s'loka are mentioned and the name of the guru is given as Jinabhadra apparently by mistake
for Jinabhata ; some minor details which may be regarded as embellishments, are omitted.
It is, therefore, clear that the tradition, on the whole, is old, and as there is nothing extrava-
gant or incredible in it, we may regard it as coming very near the truth.
It remains to mention a curious notice in the Ganadharasārdhas'ataka v. 5f: Some,
mised by the similarity of the name, have erroneously asserted that Haribhadra was
initiated and instructed by the Caityavāsins.' The Caityavāsins were those monks who
abode in temples, while their opponents advocated the vasatinivīst, i. e. the dwelling in the
houses of laymen (paragiha). Both sections seem to have coexisted for some time and no
separation to have taken place; S'ilārika is said to have been a Caityavāsin. But in the end
the Caityavāsa seems to have become discredited, and Jines'varasīri, the founder of the
Kharataragaccha in Samvat 1080=1024 A. D., established the vasatinivāsci, at least
for his sect.
It is just what might be expected that at a time when the enmity between those
two sections, or rather sects, was at its height, the Caityavāsirs should have claimed the
famous Haribha Ira for one of their own, and their opponents should have repudiated their
claim as null and void; but it is equally certain that if at Haribhadra's time the mode of the
monks' lodging had already become an important point of controversy, there would
have been no occasion to doubt which side of the question he espoused. The descriptions of
monastic life in the Samarāicca Kahā illustrate the practice of monks in his days, or at least
one he would approve of; according to it monks put up stay in a park near the town,
where they were visited by the faithful and the curious. It is not said explicitly that they
lodged there in a temple, but it seems to be excluded that Haribhadra supposed them to
lodge in houses belonging to, or furnished by, laymen.
3. Haribhadra's Works.
Haribhadra's fame as a yugapradhīna chiefly rests on his literary activity for the
sake of Jainism; he is one of the most fertile authors in Jaina Literature as regards not only
the number of the works he wrote, but also the diversity of the subjects he treated. Jinavijaya
(1. c. p. 3) enumerates 26 works of H, as the most renowned ones, of which 20 have been
edited and Kalyānavijaya (1. c. p. 139–19a) has drawn up a list of all his works, actually
1 With it agrees the very short notice in the Laghuvịtti of the Gañadharasārdhaśataka
v. 56 p. vi. It mentions besides the golden plate worn by H. on his belly,
2. The same form of the name is given in the Laghuvytti mentioned in the last note.
3 In the Laghuvrtti v. 60. According to that source and to the Pattāvall of the
Kharataragaccha ſilānka was a successor of Haribhadra; but that is impossible,
since the date of his Acārängatikā is said to be Śaka 798872 A. D. or more
than a century later than Haribhadra. According to the same source Šilānka's
successor was Uddjotanasūrī, whose successor was Vardhamānasūri, the teacher
and predecessor of Jineśvarasürī. These statements are, no doubt, arbitrary and
entirely wrong, for Uddyotanasürī who wrote his great poem in 779 A. D.,
cannot have been removed by one teacher only from Jinendra sūri, who flourished
more than two centuries later. Apparently there was no solid, if any, tradition
concerning the period which precoded the foundation of the Kharataragaccha.

HIS AGE, LIFE AND WORKS
[ XXI
preserved or known from quotations only; his list contains 88 entries. Great as this number
is, still it would be but a small fraction of the total of his writings if tradition might be
credited, which ascribes to him the composition of 1, 400 prakaranas. This tradition is
found already in our oldest sources of H.'s life (a and b), and it can be traced further back to
1068 A. D., being contained in Abhayadeva's Tīkā on H.'s Pañcās'aka finished in that year.
Now it is altogether incredible that the Jainas should have been so extremely careless in
handing down the works of their famous author that a few centuries after his death even the
titles of the great majority of them should havə been forgotten, seeing that two works which
he left unfinished, viz., Tattvārtha-laghuvrtti and Pinda-niryukti have nevertheless been
preserved. Unless, therefore, the number 1,400 be a mere hyperbole without any special
meaning, we must assume that in this connection prakarara does not denote as usually a
separate systematic treatise, but is used in a more restricted sense so that the Pañcā'saka
contains 50 prakaranas, Astaka 32, Sodas'aka 16, etc., but on what principle in other cases
his books were split into a great number of prakaranas it is impossible to say..!
Haribhadra wrote in Sanskrit and Prākrit both in verse and in prose, mostly of
course in illustration of Jaina doctrines. Two sides of his literary activity deserve special
notice, his commenting on canonical works in Sanskrit, and his discussing with an intimate
knowledge, the doctrines of Brahmans and Buddhists.
The old commentaries on the canonical books, the Niryuktis, Cūrņis and old
Bhāsyas were written in Prākrit throughout. As already mentioned above p. iii) Jiná.
dāsagani's Cūrui on the Nandīsūtra was finished in 677 A, D., it is, of course, written in
Prākrit. Haribhadra composed a commentary on the same Sūtra, making use of the work of
his predecessor; but he wrote it in Sanskrit, as well as his remaining commentaries on Sūtras.
As we know of no older Sanskrit commentary on any Sūtra in S'vetāmbara Literature, it is
very probable that the innovation was due to Haribhadra; at least the new practice was
firmly established by him, though it was further developed in the sequel. For according to
Prof. Loumann (1. c. p. 582) Haribhadra commented on the text in Sanskrit but retained
the kathānakas and certain other parts of the Cūrni in the original Prākrit; while S'ilānka
who flourished more than a century later, translates such passages also into Sanskrit.
Haribhadra is emphatically the author of prckarcinos in the technical meaning of
the word; a prakarana is a systematic treatise in which the subject is exposed in a scientific
form, unlike the unsystematic, either diffuse or episodical, treatment of subjects in canonical
books; it may be in Prākrit, but as a rule it is in Sanskrit. This way of writing originated,
of course, with the Brahmans in whose literature the models of it are to be found. The first
instance of it in Jaina Literature is Umāsvāti's (or Umāsvāmin's) Tattvārthādhigamasūtra,
which is claimed as their own by both S’vetāmbaras ånd Digambaras. The early literature
of the latter, who do not recognise the existent Siddhānta, consists largely in the prakaranas
both in Prākrit and Sanskrit. But the first undoubtedly S'vetāmbara author of prakaranas
some of whose works have come down to us, is Siddhasena-divākara. Haribhadra, who is
removed from him, as shown above p. x., by two or three generations at the utmost, raised
this branch of S'vetämbara Literature to a high degree of perfection. Though a few of these
books of his are in Prakrit, the majority of them are in Sanskrit; they contain besides an
exposition of the Jaina tenets, concise information about, and discussions or refutations of the
doctrines of opposite schools, Brahmanical and Buddhist. In this connection one of Haribha-
dra's works, though not a prakarana, has a peculiar interest, viz, his commentary on
Dignāga's Nyāyapraves'a, Siddhasena-divākara had written a Nyāyāvatāra which unmistak-

HARIBHADRA:
ably presupposes Dharmakirti's Nyāyabinduapparently intending to provide the Jainas
with a manual of Logics. But it is decidedly inferior to the masterly work of Dharmakīrti
which it was designed to supersede; nor had it any lasting success. Haribhadra, however,
instead of attempting to find a logical school of the Jainas, induced them, by commenting
on Dignāga, to study the original works of Buddhist Logicians. He apparently appreciated
their paramount importance, though he controverted, at great length, some logical propo-
sitions of Dharmakirti in his Anekāntajayapatākā. The interest of the Jainas in Buddhist
Logics continued long after his time; we owe to it the preservation of Dharmakīrti's. Nyāya-
bindu and Dharmottara's Nyāyabindutikā in the original Sanskrit; for the oldest manuscripts
of these works and of a fragment of a commentary on the latter come from Jaina bhaņdārs.
The endeavours of great teachers like Siddhasena-divākara and Haribhadra to raise
the S'vetāmbaras to the high level of Indian mental culture were brought to their conclusion
by Hemacandra who provided them with admirable text books of the principal Indian
sciences besides such standard works as more directly concerned their own creed. Thus the
S'vetāmbaras, who for many centuries seem to have remained in a comparative obscurity
as an exclusive sect, emerged to notoriety, probably about the seventh century, till at last
they became, in Guzerat and the adjoining countries, the most influential religious communi-
ty, and could even, under Kumāra pāla, be called the established church of the kingdom.
But to return to the works of Haribhadra, it remains to be noticed that he usually
employs, in the last verse of them, the word viraha which is known as his "mark".
Kalyāņa vijaya (1. c. p, 20a ff) quotes in full the passages, where this mark occurs. As
exceptions he mentions (p. 12b.) the commentaries on the Das'a vaikālika, Avas'yaka Prajñā-
panā-sūtras, 'etc. and Samarādityakathā, Saddars'anasamuccaya, Lokatattvanirna.yaetc.' It
is, however, doubtful, whether the Samarāditya kathā is an exception to the rule, since three
Mss. read the word virala in the last verse. (See the footnote to the passage, in question).
According to the legend the 'mark' virahc refers tº Haribhadra's loss. of his nephews.and
pupils Hamsa and Paramahamsa whom, however, he does not mention anywhere in his
writings as far as I know. There may be some truth in this report; but out of the simple
fact, if fact it was, there grew a long story full of miraculous incidents, which as I have
already said above, forms the greater part of the legendary life of Haribhadra. I subjoin
an abstract of it as given in the Prabhāvakacarita. (IX 48–206 ).
His sister's sons Hamsa and Paramahamsa, who had left their father's house in
disgust, became his pupils and were instructed by him in logic. They desired to go to a
Buddhist town in order to learn their S'ästra, but Haribhadra foreseeing some disaster
entreated them not to go; nevertheless they insisted on it and went, in disguise, to the
Buddhist town, where they were instructed by a Buddhist muni. Having learnt the
objection raised by the Buddhists against Jainism, they wrote a. clever refutation of
them on some leaves. A blast of wind carried the leaves away and they were brought
to the Buddhist muni, who thus became aware of the presence of some Jaina. Yati amongst
his pupils. In order to find him out, he had the image of a Jina placed on the gateway.so
that all must trample on it on entering. But the two brothers painted with chalk the
sacred thread on the breast of the image, and then they were not afraid to put their
feet on it. Now the Buddhist muni employed another trick. All pupils were confined
in an upper room and watches were placed with them; and when they were asleep he
caused a number of jars to be rolled down from the upper storey. The sleepers started up
in terror and invoked their iştadevatās. The two brothers invoking the Jina, were
thus found out; but they took a couple of umbrellas and spreading them jumped
out of the window. They reached the ground without hurt or injury and fled at
great speed. Buddhist soldiers pursued them. When they were approaching them,

HIS AGE, LIFE AND WORKS

Hamsa advised his brother to take refuge with Sūra pāla, king of a nearby town, who
would give him protection; he then fought his enemies of whom he killed a great
many, but at last he fell and died. (94.). Paramahamsa went to Sūra pāla who
granted him his protection. Soon after tlie host of pursuers arrived and demanded
the delivery of their enemy, The king, however, did not give up his protege; but
proposed that a disputation should be held, and if their speaker sliould vanquish
him, he might do with him as is proper jo such cases. The Buddhist agreed under
the condition that their opponent should remain behind a curtain, because they would
not look at the face of one so infamous. The ensuing disputation was conducted,
on the side of the Buddhists, by their S'äsa nadevata, who was invisible and spoke
from thë mouth of a pitcher. When the disputation had gone on for some days
Paramahamsa despaired and invokeil Amba, the Sāsa na levatā of his gaña. She
told him, who had, all the time, spoken against him, and advised him how to act in
the disputation. He was thus enabled to reduce his opponents to silence; then lifting
the curtain he smashed the pitcher and charged the opponent with fraudulent behaviour.
The king, conscious of the sinister intention of the Buddhists, said to them, lie who
after vanquishing me in battle will takë hold of him, may do so without fault.' Then
he gave Paramahamsa a wink, who guessing his meaning fled as quick as possible;
he was, however, closely pursued by horsemen whom he eluded by the following
trick. Seeing a washerman at work he persuaded him to get away as a sudden attack
was coming, and he himself resumed his work. When a horsemen enquired of him
whether he had seen someone on that road, he pointed out the washerman at a great
distance. The soldiers made the washerman prisoner and then returned. Paramahamsa
having thus put off his pursuers proceeded in his journey and after a few days reached
Citrakūta where he met Haribhadra. He told him what he and Hamsa had done;
but when he had related his brother's death, he was so overcome with grief that
his heart burst and died. (122). Haribhadra was deeply afflicted by the loss of his
nephews and pupils. He...conceived an intense hatred of the Buddhists and resolved
to destroy them. (133). He went to Sūrapāla and told him his intention. Confident that
Haribhadra would vanquish his opponents, the King sent a inessenger to the town
of the Buddhists and persuaded their leader to sign a contract making it binding
on him who should be vanquished in disputation, to plunge into a cauldron filled
with boiling oil. ( 157. ). The ensuing disputation turned on the Buddhist proposition
of the impermanence of everything existent. Not being able to answer Haribhadra's
arguments, the Buddhists had to undergo the punishment agreed upon. Some more
Buddhist disputants suffered the same death. (168). The Buddhists reviled the Goddess
Tārā for having caused their defeat by deserting them; but the goddess explained
that it was the just punishment for their having killed Hamsa and Paramahamsa. (179).
Jinabhata, who had heard of Haribhadra's cruel revenge, sent him, through
two bhiksus, the three gāthās which contain the argument of the Samarādityakatha
(see p. 6, 1. 2 ff). Haribhadra guessed his meaning; just as Agnis'arman's hatred had
lasted through nine births, so his enmity towards the Buddhists would have the
most disastrous consequences for him. He, therefore, took leave of the king and
went to his guru; full of contrition he asked his forgiveness and did severe penance
as ordered by him. (196). The goddess Ambā rebuked him for still grieving at
his bereavement; it was due to his Karma that he left no successors in his line of
teachers; his books would stand in their stead. ( 203 ). He composed the Samarādityakathā
and according to the three gāthās sent him by his guru, and wrote 1,400 prokaranas;
they all exhibit the mark viraha in remembrance of his two nephews. (206).

HARIBHADRA :
The narrative in the Prabhāvakacarita is writton to say the least, in a most
unconventional style of poetry, rendered frequently unintelligible by the bad preservation
of the text. It seems to be based on a popular story, perhaps on a kind of Rās. We
are acquainted with another version of the same subject, similar on the whole but
differing in many details, from an abstract, or rather skeleton of an abstract in
Rājas ekhara's Kathākos'a ( 1350 A. D.), the greater part of which has been given by
Kalyāṇavijaya (1. c. p. 8b.). According to this account:
Hamsa and Paramahamsa made three strokes on the throat of the image of Jina,
thereby changing it into one of Buddha. But remarking that the Buddhist guru regarded
them with suspicion they pretended to be ill and escaped taking with them a Buddhist relic
(kapālikā or karparikā). To recover the relic the king sent a troop of soldiers after them;
but as H. and P. were sahasrayodhinsa, they defeated them. Now the king despatched a
large army, with which H. fought, while P. fled with the relic. H. was at last overcome by
the great number of his enemies, who cut off his head and brought it to the King. But the
guru insisted on recovering the relic. Therefore soldiers went in search of Paramahamsa.
They discovered him sleeping before the walls of Citrakūta the gates of which were closed,
and cut off his head. Haribhadra finding the corpse of his pupil and nephew, fell into a
tremendous rage. He filled cauldrons with boiling oil and attracted by charm 1,440
Bauddhas through the air to be made a sacrifice of. His guru sent him the three găthās.
Haribhadra's wrath was appeased, and he composed 1,440 granthas in atonement of his
passion and sins.
A comparison of this version of the story with the preceding one is of interest for
those who investigate the growth of popular tales; but a critical inquirer, will, no doubt,
reject both alike as sources for the history of Haribhadra's life. Even that he had two
nephews and pupils named Hamsa and Paramahamsa who perished in an attempt at
learning by stealth the doctrines of the Buddhists, statements which form the foundation of
the legend and are by no means incredible in themselves, must be accepted with the utmost
reserve. The legendary account of the circumstances which led to Haribhadra's composing
the Samarāiccakahā will be discussed in the next paragraph.
The rest of the account in the Prabhavākacarita contains some details not uz
worthy of remark. I, therefore, add an abstract of the concluding part of the 9th s'rriga of
that work (v. 206-221).
Haribhadra diverted the layman Kārpāsika from his partiality for the Bhārata
and Itihāsa by telling him the five stories of rogues ( 211 ), and won him over to the
Jaina faith. He ordered him to make an edition of his works and to distribute them
among the yatis (217). He caused other people to construct 84 temples on one
platform (ekapīthe ), 218. He also produced the Mahānis'īthasūtra from a decaying
manuscript, (219). Ending his life by anas'and he ascended to heaven ( 221 ).

THE DHĀRTĀKHYĀNA: A CRITICAL STUDY
BY

1. The Prākrit Text
THE DHURTĀKHYĀNA of Haribhadrasūri, whose career is
to be assigned to the middle of 8th century A. D.,' is a typical
literary work that has a special significance in Indian literature. It had
already attracted the attention of E. Leumann some forty years back; and it is
through him that N. Mironow could refer to some parallel stories in his
dissertation on the Dharmaparīkşā of Amitagati, Some Gujarāti and Hindi
renderings of Dhū, have appeared in India, but they were primarily concerned
with the contents and not with the Prākrit text of that work.
This unique work, in Prākrit, is now brought out for the first time in
this Singhi Jain Series having been critically edited by Acārya Śrī Jinavijayji,
Its Sanskrit version by Sanghatilaka and an Old-Gujarāti prose rendering by an
unknown writer have also been included in this edition to facilitate its compara-
tive study.
The Prākrit text, presented here, is based on three mss., A, B,
and 0.3: They do not bear any dates, but A and B, as described
by the learned editor in his Preface, look quite old; and they may be
assigned to 16th century A. D. C is quite modern and just a copy of A
prepared by an inexperienced scribe; consequently the readings of C are
not noted. A and B are sufficiently independent and do show some variants
noted in the foot-notes. Confusion in numbering the verses is seen in both.
B looks not only older but is also more accurate than A. The ms. A shows
necessarily y-sruti for the udvrtta vowel (as I surmise, irrespective of the
preceding vowel); while B very often puts a (or ā) for the lost consonant:
this possibly means that B is following the more strict rule about y-śrutt
specified by Hemacandra in his Commentary, and its so-called accuracy
perhaps betrays the hand of some revisionist or copyist possessing a thorough
mastery over Hemacandra's Prākrit grammar.

DHŪRTĀKHYĀNA :
These two Mss., A and B, do not show any recensions as such. If
B omits a verse (V. 26) and A repeats some line (V. 47), this is due just
to scribal lapse. The concluding verse (V. 125) cannot belong to Haribhadra.
His composition ends with V. 124 which mentions bhava-viraha, Haribhadra's
distinguishing mark; and the contents of the following verse do betray that
it is composed by some zealous follower of Haribhadra. Certain portions of the
Prākrit text are not specifically covered by the Sanskrit (III. 836, 84;
V. 115–18 ) and Gujarāti versions (III. 83-84; V. 111) which closely follow it;
but looking to the context etc., this cannot be a conclusive proof to suspect
those portions as later additions in Haribhadra's text.
At the kind request of Ācārya Śrī Jinavijayji, I have attempted below
a study of this important literary work. Before subjecting its different aspects
to a critical scrutiny, it would be proper to give a short outline of the stories
occurring in this work.
2. Summary of the Contents
Adjacent to the prosperous town of Ujjainī, there was a fine park of
luxuriant vegetation with a garden-house. During their wanderings there
arrived hundreds of confirmed rogues who had acquired specific proficiency in the
tricks of their trade. They had five leaders: Mūlaśrī, Kaņdarīka, Elāşādha, Sasa
and Khandapānā. Every one of the first four had five hundred male cheats
and Khaņdapānā had an equal number of female cheats, as their retinue.
Mūlaśrī was their foremost chief. During the height of rainy season, when it
was heavily pouring all over the week and when it was not possible to move
about, all the rogues, shivering and hungry, began to deliberate as to who
would give them a feast for the day, Mūladevaa stipulated thus: Every
one should address the chamber of cheats about what one had heard or experi-
enced; and he who proves it to be an incredible lie should give food and
drink to the gathering of rogues. But he who confirms the same by quoting
parallels from various scriptures like the Purāņa, Bhārata and Rāmāyaṇa and
convinces the audience, is not to give anything; and he would be made the
lord of rogues.' They all agreed to this and requested ) Müladeva to narrate
U his experience (I. 1-16).
Mūladeva said: “I shall tell you what I experienced as a youth.
Yearning for prosperity, I went to the abode of Iśvara to receive the stream of
Gangā on my head. As I was travelling with a gourd-kettle and umbrella in
hand, a mad wild-elephant rushed at me like a moving mountain. I trembled
with fear; I saw no shelter and escape; so I lept into the gourd-kettle that my
life might be saved. The elephant was infuriated and followed me into the
gourd-kettle where I deceived it by hide-and-seek for a period of six months.
1 For the convenience of general readers I have given the names in Sanskrit, though
some of them appear to be un-Sanskritio in origin. -
2 Mūladeva and Mūlaśrī are alternative names.

Page 37****************************************************************************************
A CRITICAL STUDY
At last I escaped through the spout of the gourd-kettle; but when the elephant
also followed me, its tail-hair was caught in the spout-hole. I approached,
however, the ocean-like river Gangā, crossed the rushing stream, and reached the
abode of Iśvara. Standing hunger and thirst, I received the stream of Gangā
on my head for six months. Thence I came to Ujjainī and met you all here. If
you accept all this as true, confirm it by evidence; if you think this to be a lie,
well, give us a feast." Kaņdarīka observed that one who has read Bhārata,
Purāṇas and Rāmāyaṇa would not call this a lie (I. 17–34).
Kaņdarika continued: “What we hear in the Bhārata and Purāņa is
reliable, therefore your experience also is true. 1) It is said that the Vipras are
born from the mouth, the Kșatriyas from the arms, Vaiśyas from the thighs
and Sūdras from the feet of Brahman: that means the entire population could
be accommodated in Brahman's body. 2) Umā could lead a married life with
Isvara whose male organ could not be measured even by Brahman and Vişņu.
3) The saint Vyāsa has narrated thus in the Bhārata : The chief queen of
Virāța king had no progeny. She propitiated a certain saint who asked her
to go to the bamboo-bower and eat the dish whereby she would have one
hundred children. She did so and went home. After some time there arrived
the saint Gāgali? and sat practising austerities under the bamboo-grove. He
glanced passionately at the nude nymphs bathing in the lake; and out of his
first drop of semen there was born Kicaka, as mighty as elephant. Thus were
generated one hundred Kīcakas who were all first accommodated in bamboos
and who were later received by the queen.' 4) Gangā was deluded by Hara
in his matted hair for one thousand years, 5) Vişņu, the creator of the world,
was practising penance on the bed of ocean; the lotus-seated Brahman, with
staff and gourd in hand, came out of the navel of Vişņu, but the lotus was
caught stuck there. 6) It is narrated in the Bhārata that Brahman began
practising penance for thousand years; and the jealous gods wanted to frustrate
his efforts, Indra counselled thus: Woman has been a mighty temptress,
and none except Mahāvīra could stand the arrows of Madana. Seeing the
limbs of Umā, Pasupati became passionate even at the sacred hour of marriage;
and Droņācārya was generated from the semen-drop fallen in a pot. Similarly
eminent personalities like Gautama, Vasiştha, Pārāśara, Jamadagni, Kāśyapa,
Agastya, Indra, Hara, Hari, etc. are all victims of cupid. So Tilottamā should
be sent to tempt Brahman; and thus his penance would be destroyed.'
Accordingly Tilottamā approached Brahman in a beautiful dress and began to
dance before him like a Campaka flower. When Brahman began to gaze at
her, she stood dancing by his right side. With a passionate craze for her
Brahman developed four faces, as she shifted herself in different directions,
When she jumped up, he had on his head a fifth face; but it was plucked by
Rudra, Brahman was very much irritated and infuriated. From the drop
thousand years: Woman has b of Madana. Smarriage
I Gāgali perhaps stands for Garga.
2 I have normalised these names according to the popular usage.

DHŪRTĀKHYANA :
of perspiration on his forehead was born Svedakundalin' who, at Brahman's
order, overthrew Samkara (=Rudra = īśvara = Hara ) who ran to Vişņu for
almas while the latter was practising penance in the Badarikāśrama. Vişnu
opened the vein on his forehead, but the skull of Brahman, which Isvara held,
could not be filled. When Iśvara dipped his finger in the blood, a man
Raktakuņdalin by name, was generated. At Rudra's behest Raktakundalin
fought against Svedakundalin. Their long battle was declared drawn by the
gods; one was given in charge of the Sun and the other in charge of Indra so
that they might continue their fight in the Bhārata war. When the Sun was
enamoured by Kunti's beauty and cohabited with her, Karna was conceived
by her and delivered through the ear. 7) It has been narrated in the
Rāmāyaṇa that Payanasuta, a monkey, crossed the ocean by his arms at the
order of Rāghava and reached Lankā. 8) For the benefit of the world, Gangā
was invited from the heaven by gods; and her stream was received on the head
by Isvara for thousands of years.
If the above events are acceptable, then that you were accommodated
with the elephant in the gourd-kettle (Nos. 1-3), that you deluded it for
six months (No. 4), that its tail-hair was stuck in the spout (No. 5), that
you could escape through the spout (No. 6), that you crossed Gangā (No. 7),
and that you received her stream on your head (No. 8) are all quite true.
You are a good man endowed with wisdom and fame." (I. 35-93).
II
Being requested by Mūlaśrī, Kaņdarika began to narrate his
experiences: "Naughty as I was in my boyhood, my parents drove me out
of the house. I reached a rich village on the frontier. There a Yakşa,
Kamaladala by name, lived under the Vața tree; he possessed miraculous
powers; and he bestowed boons on women. A fair was held in his honour, and
people gathered together in gallant dress. I joined the fair, paid respects to
the deity, and attended the horse-play. All of a sudden there was an attack
from a well-equipped party of robbers; consequently one and all from the fair,
even the horses, entered into a cucumber; the sports continued therein; and
the party of robbers returned saying that the village had disappeared. There
arrived a flock of animals; a goat swallowed that cucumber; a boa gulped that
goat; and a crane flew up to the top of the Vața tree, after eating up the boa.
A king was camping under that tree. Mistaking the crane's leg for a banyan-
shoot, a mad elephant was tied to it by the driver. When the crane took up
its leg, the elephant was lifted up; and the driver raised a cry that some one
snatched away his animal. Skilled archers rushed forth and shot the crane

dead. It fell lifeless on the earth like a mountain-peak. At the king's order,
its stomach was opened; and vivisection was continued on the inner contents,
till at last all the people, horses, etc. came out like a swarm of moths from a
nest. They went to their respective places, and I went home. I have myself
experienced all this; well, if you disbelieve, give us a feast.” (II. 1-25).
Elāsādha, who had studied Purāņa, Bhārata, etc., at once said that
whatever Kaņdarīka described was quite believable without any doubt. He
continued to confirm the same:"1) According to the Vişnupurāņa, in the
beginning, when the five elements had not come into existence, there was the
extensive ocean on the waves of which rolled an egg for a long time. It broke
into two halves; and out of one half came this earth. Thus all the living beings,
gods, men, beasts, etc. were found accommodated in that egg. 2) In the
Aranya-parvan, Mārkaņdeya has narrated his experience to Dharmaputra thus:
'At the time of universal deluge, when there was water everywhere and the
world was devoid of living habitation, an extensive and lofty Vața tree was seen.
A handsome boy was seated on a bed which was spread on its branches. The
saint Mārkandeya stretched his arms to receive the boy. lest he might succumb
to the floods. He visualised in the stomach of that boy the whole world with
its mountains and forests. He entered the stomach and dwelt there for one
thousand years, but could not reach its end: so he came out at last. Thus a
child's stomach could contain the whole world.' 3 ) Devaki's waist was so slender:
that it could be caught in a fist; still Keśava dwelt in her womb; and his stomach
contained the earth with its mountains, forests, etc. 4) Without being suffocated
to death, all the people on the earth lived comfortably in the stomach of
Vāsudeva and continued their activities such as agriculture, trade, battle,
festivals, etc. There is no doubt that the world was contained in Keśava's
stomach. Once Brahman claimed that he is the creator (kartā), because the four
Varņas emerged from his mouth, arms, thighs and feet; but Keśava retorted
that his claim was ridiculous and that he (Brahman) was as good as his boy.
Keśava continued that the earth and sky formed the cavity, the mountains his
jaws and the ocean his tongue; if necessary, Brahman should enter his stomach
and see that the whole world was there. Keśava further added that Brahman
was ungratefully talking thus when he too was born from his navel. 5) At the
time of Draupadi's self-choice, it is reported that the mighty bow of Drupada
was presided over by deities. Drupada announced that he who strung his bow
and shot the specified target would win the hand of Draupadī. Many kings
failed to string it. That mighty Siśupāla' was nearly successful, but Krşņa
frustrated his attempt by putting into the bow some additional weight in the
form of elephants, mountains, planets, etc. The bow was so heavy that even
the earth could not bear the load. Arjuna, however, took the aid of Bhīma's
palm for its support, ably strung the bow, and successfully hit the target.
1 If we read risino, then it would mean that the boy recrived that saint.
2 The text reads Basipāla,

Page 40****************************************************************************************
DHŪRTĀKHYĀNA :
Draupadi was given to him in marriage. Thus the bow could contain mountains,
planets, etc. 6) We hear in the Rāmāyaṇa that Jațāyu, the vulture, fought
with his wings against Rāvaņa who cut his wings in the fight; and when Jațāyu
fell on the ground, he appeared as big as Mandara mountain. Sītā blessed him
that his wings would be restored after meeting the messenger of Rāma.
Hanumat was sent by Rāma in search of Sítā; and he mistook for a mountain
that body of Jātāyu who gave him the necessary information about her.
Jațāyu got the wings and flew to the heaven. So it means that a vulture can
be as big as the Mandara mountain.
If the above events are true, then quite reliable are the incidents that
the whole village could be accommodated in a cucumber (Nos. 1-3), that all the
people could come out of it with their lives safe (No. 4), that a crane could
contain all that (No. 5), and that there could be a big crane of that description
(No. 6)." (II. 26–75).

Elāşādha narrated his experiences thus: “In my youth, greedy as I
was, I pursued the fad of metallic transmutation and wandered everywhere in
search of the specific juice, etc. On getting the information, I travelled a long
distance with steps covering hundred Yojanas, lifted a huge lid-stone, took the
necessary juice from the golden pond, put the lid as before, and then returned
home. Through the favour of that fluid, I had plenty of wealth and abundant
possessions: servants waited on me, bards praised me, and young girls sang and
danced round me. I gave gifts to the poor and needy. Hearing about my
wealth, a party of well-equipped robbers besieged my palace at night. I
thought, I must defend my well-earned property. With a bow in hand I
fought against them and finished many of them on the spot. The rest of them
attacked me at once, cut my head, put it on the badara tree, and went away
after robbing all my property.) My head comfortably began eating the badara
fruits, and this was seen by people early in the morning. They realized that it
was still living and joined all my limbs; and here I stand before you in person.
If you find my personal experience unreliable, well, then give a feast.” (III.1-19).
Sasa affirmed that Elāsādha's experience was quite reliable, because there
are similar cases in Purāņas, Bhārata and Rāmāyaṇa: 1) Jamadagni suspected
the fidelity of his wife Reņukā who was enamoured of king Aśvāpahrta and
ordered his son [Parasu-] Rāma to cut her head. He was pleased with his
son Rāma who carried out the order and asked him to demand a boon. Rāna
solicited that his mother should be restored to life; and she was made alive
by Jamadagni. 2) The two halves of his body were conjoined by Jarā; and
later on he became the great king Jarāsaṁdha. 3) The gods conspired
to destroy the two mighty brothers, Sunda and Nisunda, who proved a terror
to them. They contributed bits from their bodies and thus created an extremely
beautiful nymph, Tilottamā by name. Humbly she received orders from gods
and started on her mission to destroy the two brothers. Seeing her tempting

A CRITICAL STUDY
limbs, Sunda 'and Nisunda grew passionate for her; they fought mutually for
her sake and destroyed each other. Thus the gods could create Tilottamā
by putting bits from their own bodies. 4) In his childhood Hanumat was
instructed by his mother Añjanā that he was to eat red fruits whenever hungry.
He mistook the sun for a fruit; and when he jumped up to snatch the solar orb,
his body was reduced to pieces. Seeing his wife lamenting and the son killed,
Pavana became enraged and retired to Pātāla. There was no breeze in
the world, and people were very much worried. The gods approached and
appeased him. The limbs of his son were put together, and he was made alive.
His chin was missing; so in the absence of it, he came to be called Hanumat.
Thus Hanumat could be made alive by putting together bits of his body.
5) When Rāma went to Lankā, a fierce fight ensued between his army and
that of Rāvaņa. In course of fight prince Lakşmaņa fell heavily wounded,
and Rāma began to lament. Hanumat, however, went to Dronagiri and
brought Niśśalyā herb. Not only Lakşmaņa was cured thereby but all the
monkeys that were lying wounded were also healed and made alive. 6) Siva
and Pārvatī were enjoying amorous pleasure in a Himālayan cave for a long
time; and all the gods were anxious, because they did not want any progeny
from them. After long deliberations, they decided that Agni, obliging as he
was, should go to Iśvara who might then perhaps abstain from coition. Agni
was rather unwilling, because Siva was a terrible and uncongenial fellow.
Indra, however, prevailed upon Agni who was assured that Siva would certainly
behave better in the company of Umā. Though intervened by Umā, īśvara,
was enraged to see Agni there and forced him to drink his semen. Agni was in
flames as it were due to that semen; he rushed to the ocean; and he felt some
relief only after vomitting it there. It is said that jewels arose out of this
semen. Whatever. bit was still remaining in his stomach Agni vomitted
in a lotus-lake. Six nymphs, called Kșttikā, were bathing in that lake ; and they
happened to conceive at the contact of semen. After the necessary period of
time, they delivered the head, arms, thighs, trunk, etc. When they brought
together the limbs with surprise, they got joined mutually at their proper places ;
and thus Mahāsena was born. He leads the rigorous life of a celebate and
dwells in a forest in the South. Thus the limbs produced from different wombs
could get joined and Mahāsena could be produced. 7) Rāhu has no head;
still he moves in the sky and swallows (or eclipses) the sun and the moon,
8) Vişņu, in the guise of a Dvija, begged of Bali only three steps of the ground,
pervaded thereby the whole world, and deprived him of the earth. 9) It is
reported in the Rāmāyaṇa that Hanumat, when Lakşmaņa fell wounded in
the battle between Rāma and Rāvanu, brought the lofty mountain Droņa with
its vegetation, as he wanted some herb. 10) Madhumatha, in his incarnation of
Varāha, lifted up the earth with its mountains, trees, etc.
If the above events are true, it is quite believable that the limbs of
your body could get joined (Nos. 1-6), that your head could taste badara fruits

and that you could lift up the heavy stone of the lid (Nos. 9-10).” (III. 20–98).

Saša narrated his experience thus: “I have my field near the
mountain, and once I went there from my village during autumn. An elephant
rushed on me from the mountain. I trembled with fear and somehow managed
to climb a lofty sesamum tree. The elephant whirled round the tree; sesamum
seeds were showered all round; and when they were crushed under its hoofs,
there was a flood of sesamum oil. Stuck deep in mud, the elephant died of
hunger and thirst. I breathed a sigh of relief, got down the tree, drank some
ten pots of sesamum oil and ate a load of seed-stuff, prepared a bag of that
elephant's hide, filled it with oil, and entered my village after placing that bag on
a tree outside. I asked my son to bring the bag; but he could not see it; so he
pulled out the tree and brought it home. This is my personal experience; well,
if any one does not believe all this, he should entertain us with a feast.” (IV. 1-13)
Khandapānā said that there were parallels to Saśa's experience in the
Bhārata, Rāmāyaṇa etc. She continued to confirm the same:“ 1) It is
reported that, at Pāțaliputra, a drum was carved from the wood of māşa
plant. 2) According to the Bhārata the ichor fluid of elephants flowed like a
flooded river, washing down elephants, horses and chariots. 3) Bhīmasena
killed the demon Baka at Ekacakra and gulped pots of rice, a buffalo and a
thousand jugs of wine. 4) It is said that Kumbhakarņa, whenever he woke
up, ate hundreds of men and drank a thousand pots of water. 5) According
to Purāņas, the saint Agastya drank the ocean in order to destroy Asuras. 6)
On her way from heaven, the river Gangā passed through the matted hair of
Hara. When she flowed through the hermitage of Jahnu, he gulped and
retained her in his stomach for one thousand years. 7) The saint Kāśyapą
had two wives, Kadrū and Vinatā. These cowives once betted: the loser should
either become a life-long slave of the other or give nectar for her freedom.
Vinatā became the slave of Kadrū who tried to disgrace her now and then.
She was always miserable. Once she laid three eggs: the first produced a
half-grown scorpion, and the second, the thighless Aruņa who later on became
the charioteer of the sun. She learnt a lesson, and broke the third egg after it
was fully ripe. The mighty Garuda was produced; and he proved a great
danger to the sons of Kadrū who, on that account, constantly teased Vinatā.
On her being requested by Garuņa, Vinatã explained to him how she was mise.
rable due to her slavery and how she would be freed by the nectar the source
of which was known to his blind father, now staying in the Badarī Aśrama.
He went to Kāśyapa who recognised him by touch. According to his father's
wish, that hungry Garuda satisfied his hunger by eating a huge elephant and
an equally huge tortoise which were constantly disturbing the lake by mutual
quarrel. On his way back he saw a huge, extensive Vața tree under which
millions of Vālakbilya saints, the progeny of Brahman, were practising penance.

OS
Garuda sat on its branches, but they cracked easily. Fearing that the saints
underneath might be killed, Garuda picked up that tree in his beak, flew across
the sky to the great surprise of gods, and dropped it on an island which is
known as Lankā and which is the abode of Rāvaņa. Once more he feasted on
the Nişādas. He learnt from his father that the nectar-pond is situated beyond
the hells and Pătāla; it is surrounded by burning flames; and that it is constantly
guarded by gods, etc. One has to offer oblations to the flames, and then
perhaps it might be obtained. He went there, satisfied the flames, and picked
up the nectar-pot. Gods equipped with arms and weapons pursued him; and a
heavy battle took place with Garuđa on one side and the rest on the other.
When the party of gods was routed away, Indra came on the field and used his
missile without any effect. He invoked the help of Vişņu who pursued Garuda
with his Cakra. Saints, planets, etc. approached Vişņu and told him that it
was below his dignity to follow Garuda like this. Treaty was effected between
the two, and Garuda became the banner of Vişnu. Vinatā was set free by that
nectar. Thus the elephant and tortoise could be killed and the banyan tree
could be carried by Garuda. 8) When it was heavily raining for a week,
Madhumatha lifted the mountain Govardhana. 9) While building the dam
the monkeys brought mountains from a long distance and dropped them in the
ocean. 10) In destroying the park Hanumat easily rooted out big trees.
If the above details are true, it is quite believable that there could be
such a big sesamum tree (No. 1), that there could be a stream of oil (No. 2),
that you could eat a load of seed-stuff and drink ten pots of oil (Nos. 3-6), that
you could carry the bag made of elephant-skin (Nos. 7–8), and that your
son could pull out the tree and carry it home (Nos. 9-10).” (IV. 14-94).
i) Then that Khandapānā, the authoress of the Arthaśāstra, suggested
that all others should humble themselves before her to get a feast. Of course
they were too proud to fold their hands to her. She smiled and began to narrate
her experience: “In my youth I was enchantingly beautiful. After the
monthly bath, while sleeping in the veranda, I was enjoyed by the passionate
Wind. Immediately I delivered a son; and after taking my leave, he went
away somewhere. Tell me whether it is a lie; if it is true that the Wind can
procreate a son, no barren woman would be found in this world.” (V. 1-10).
Mūladeva confirmed her experience thus: “1) According to popular
scriptures, the Wind procreated Bhimasena from Kuntī and Hanumat from Nilā.
2) Vyāsa, born from Pārāśara and a fisher-woman, Yojanagandhā by name,
walked away soon after his birth, instructing his mother to remember him on
occasions. Through the favour of that saint, Yojanagandhā became a virgin
again, was married to Santanu and had a son Vicitravīrya who died without
issues. She remembered Vyāsa fearing that the family might become extinct;
and he procreated Pāņdu, Dhrtarāştra and Vidura, but cursed his bed-mates in

the end. In the light of these events, it is quite natural that the Wind
generated a child in you; and it walked away immediately after delivery."
(V. 11-19).
ii) Khaņdapānā narrated further: "Once my friend Umā entrusted
me with miraculous syllables whereby I attracted the burning Sun who
procreated in me a mighty son; but no harm was done to me." 3) Kaņdarīka
said that it was quite possible, because Kuntī too was not burnt in any way
by the Sun (who generated Karņa from her]. (V. 20-23).
ii) Khaņdapānā added further: "A second time I attracted Agni,
the mouth of gods, by whom a brilliant son was born to me; and I was not
burnt in the least. How is it?" Elāsādha silenced her thus: "4) The wife
of Yama was being enjoyed by Agni; but on seeing that her husband arrived
there, she swallowed Agni. Yama gulped her, and entered the assembly of gods
who welcomed him as Mr. yourself, the third'. He vomitted his wife; and she
vomitted Agni who ran into the forest being pursued by him. The elephants
did not give Yama any report", so he deprived them of their speech. Thus if
Yama's wife was not burnt, how could you be burnt?" (V. 24-31).
iv) Khaņdā added again that once she attracted Indra by whom
she had a son; and she asked how Indra could come to her in preference
to celestial nymphs. Saśa told her that it was quite possible: 5) Ahalyā was
enjoyed by Indra who thereby suffered heavily at the hands of Gautama and
whose consequent bodily pores became his thousand eyes; 6) secondly, Kunti
also got a son by Indra. (V. 32-37).
v) On her inquiry, Mūladeva told Khandapānā that she was the
daughter of Nāgaśarman and Somaśrī of Pāțaliputra and her Gotra was
Gautama. Khandapānā complained that her identity was confused, and narrated
a bit of her biography thus: “My name is Dagdhikā, the artisan's daughter,
well-known among royal washer-men. My profession has been low, though our
family is quite prosperous. Thousands of washermen worked under me; and
with them, one day, I went to the river with a cart-load of clothes which were
all washed clean and spread in the sunshine. Suddenly they were blown off by
a whirl-wind. I asked the servants to run away and took the responsibility on
me. Lest the king might punish me, I assumed the form of a lizard and
reached the city park at night. Early morning I feared, I might be killed for a
dish. After a good deal of thought, I changed myself into a mango plant.
After day-break I heard the royal drum declaring all washermen to be excused;
and once again I became a woman. The leather straps, etc. from the carts
were eaten at night by jackals and dogs; but my father procured a mouse-tail
out of which he got all of them once more prepared." Sasa said that it is quite
believable that the tail of a mouse was so big as to prepare straps, etc., 7)
because we know that the male organ of Siva was immeasurably long, and 8)

because the tail of Hanumat was so long as to encircle the city of Lankā which
was burnt by it on its being covered with clothes, sprinkled with oil and ignited.
He further added: “It is quite possible that you became a lizard and a mango
plant, because we hear in the Purāņas thus: 9) Gandhārikāvara transformed
himself into a Kurabaka tree. 10) Then there was that mighty king Nahuşa
who vanquished Indra ; but being cursed by BỊhaspati, he became a boa in a
forest. When Pāņdavas were banished into wilderness, the boa swallowed
Bhima. Dharma gave necessary replies to the boa which consequently vomitted
Bhima and which became the king at last.
Khandapānā requested the rest of the rogues to accept quietly her
authority, and then she would entertain them with a feast. In case she were
to defeat them actually, they would be as worthless as a broken cowrie. The
rogues thundered in reply that no one, not even a divine rogue, can vanquish
them. With a view to put them to shame, she continued her biography and
addressed them further: "With king's permission, I visited many places in
search of those clothes blown off by the wind. I had lost, moreover, four of my
servants since long; and in search of them I came here. I find now that you
are those very servants and that you are wearing those very clothes. Either
you accept this as true and be my slaves; or if you do not, well, give the feast."
All of them felt ashamed; as they were outwitted, they accepted her as their
chief; and they requested her to entertain all the rogues during the rainy week.
(V. 38-78).
Khaņdapānā smiled to see that their manly vanity was smashed; but
when they all insisted on getting a feast from her, she agreed to that. She
went to the burial ground which presented a hedious and horrible spectacle.
She managed to get a dead baby which was physically intact and lately
dropped there. After bathing it and muffling it in rags, she entered Ujjainī,
approached a banker's mansion, and addressed the busy banker that she was a
Brāhmin's daughter, that she had lately delivered a son, and that she was badly
in need of money. The busy banker got irritated and asked his servants to
drive her out. When force was used, she fell on the ground; and she started
beating her breast etc. and lamenting loudly that her son, the only hope of
her life, was killed by the banker who was so proud of his wealth. The banker
was upset, and with all efforts tried to console her, requesting her not to raise a
cry. He gave her an ear-ring and asked her to remove the child quietly. She
removed the dead body, and by that banker's gift everything was allright.
After throwing the dead babe, she went to the jewel-market jubilantly; she sold
the ring and gave a rich feast to the rogues who were shivering with cold.
They all heartily congratulated her on her skill and generosity, and openly
confessed that woman is wiser by birth than man. (V. 79-110).
In this world various personalities like Candra, Indra, Vāyu, Sūrya,
Agni and Dharma are all oppressed by passions. According to the scripture,

DHŪRTĀKHYANA :
Kyşņa is ubiquitous and all-pervasive'; then where is the need of his thinking
about those (Gopīs) who are anxious for him? There are many other unbelievable
legends current in the world, such as, the origin of (Pavana) Ganapati from
the limbs of Pārvatī; the births of Brahman, Tilottamā, Urvasī, Drona and
Şanmukha; the release of Narakūbara through Krşņa; the procreation of
Svedakuņdala through anger and that of Nara (i. e., Raktakuņqala) from a pot
of blood; and the birth of Yādava Balarāma through Māyā’s mediation.
Pārvatī was the daughter of mountain : if mountains are to deliver children, the
world would be too small for human population. These and such other stories
from the Bhārata and Rāmāyaṇa are like artificial gold; and they do not stand
the test of rational scrutiny. The popular scriptures do not contain any
attractive stuff. Leaving them, therefore, one should follow the path preached
by the Sarvajña with a steady and pure faith. (V. 111-22).
This fine Kathā, with its various legends, has been narrated to the
pious residents of Citrakūta”; it has been composed by Haribhadrasūri for
purifying the faith ; and may it bestow bhava-viraha on the faithful who hear
and narrate it. (V. 123-24).
Let Haribhadra, the Svetāmbara Sūri, who has such a faith in the
brilliant Jaina doctrine, bestow welfare on us. (V. 125).
3. Purpose, Technique and Form
Whatever may be their historical explanation and symbolical signi-
fication, there are innumerable legends, scattered all over the epics and Purāņas,
which, on account of some detail or the other, are unnatural, inconsistent,
exaggerated and unacceptable to reason. The 'precious blossoms of immortal
poetic art and profound wisdom' seen in the epics are often overpowered by
an array of irrational legends. "It is only unpoetical theologians and com-
mentators and clumsy copyists who hare succeeded in conglomerating into a
heterogeneous mass parts which are actually incompatible and which date
from different centuries."4 What is true of the Mahābhārata is much more
true about the Purāņas which are well-known for their sectarian multiplication
of myths and legends and hyperbolic exaggeration of details. Even from
amongst the custodians and adherents of these texts the revisionists have tried
their hands on them partly to make the legends conform to the changing
ethico-moral notions and partly to rationalise and humanise them by removing
glaring inconsistencies etc. This is amply borne out by the recensions and
textual variations detected by critical editors. The episode of Draupadi's

are
like artificial com do not stand the tonly from outside
marriage and the way in which the later Kāvyas etc. use the Purāņic legends
sufficiently illustrate the above tendencies. We cannot expect the zealous
follower to ridicule in any way the Purāņic legends or to raise a moral protest
against the sins in the world of gods, held by him in reverence. That Kannada
poet Sarvajña is an exception. He has spared none from his severe satirical
stings. According to him our Mahābhārata is a tale of brothers killing brothers
and of looseness of marriage institution (hādara); and those who respectfully
attend to it degrade themselves.
Haribhadra's attack, in the Dhūrtākhyāna, is directed against such
legends found in the epics and Parāṇas. His conclusion is threefold: the
popular scriptures, when one scrutinizingly studies them, are found to contain
worthless stuff that looks smooth only from outside (V. 120); the legends
narrated in them do not stand the test of rational scrutiny and are unacceptable
like artificial gold (V. 119); and the pious, who believed in them so far, should
abandon them and follow the path of Sarvajña (V. 121). Indirectly, but
inevitably, these works being religious scriptures, the entire Purāņic religion
and its followers are being exposed to criticism; the former for having contained
such legends and the latter for their acceptance of the same.
Logical polemics and witty criticism are the two recognised modes of
attack; their ultimate purpose is to knock down the opponent; but their ways
and intermediate tactics are different, and the weapons in their armouries and
their movements on the field are dissimilar. The former necessarily requires
an elaborate and systematic seige and a trained audience to pronounce the
judgement; while the latter needs alert wit and adroit movements. If one
is a trenched battle, the other is a guerilla warfare. The success of the former
leaves behind acrimony that might involve endless attacks and counter, attacks ;
but that of the latter wounds the opponent without leaving a scar and pricks
him without bleeding. Logicians can be trained for the purpose, but a witty
critic is an artist by birth.
Haribhadra is an eminent logician, no doubt; -but, in this work, on
the whole, we see him more as a witty critic assailing the citadel of Parāṇic
legends. The plot of the work is simple. It is a story of five rogues each of
whom recounts an impossible, fantastical experience which is confirmed to be
true by one or the other colleague after quoting parallels from the Mahābhārata,
Rāmāyaṇa, etc. In the last chapter this mode of presentation is slightly
modified. It is their female accomplice that narrates her experiences; and
the remaining take their respective chances to confirm the same by Purāņic
parallels. She narrates her biography, and suddenly puts them on the horns
of a dilemma: if they accept her statement, they have to submit to her as
slaves; and if they refuse, they have to give a feast to the whole gathering.
They find that they are outwitted; her superiority is accepted; she trickily
extracts wealth from a merchant by charging him with the murder of her child ;
and all the rogues get a grand feast from her. To this plot, which is mainly

Page 48****************************************************************************************
DHĒRTĀKUTĀNA :
made up of conversation with casual descriptions, there is a Preamble (I. 1-16)
which introduces the rogues, their stipulation and their agreement, besides the
opening mangala; and there is also a Conclusion (V. 111f.) which summarily
denounces some of the legends, besides giving the author's conclusion, aim and
personal details.
The improbable and fantastic tales narrated by the rogues as a part of
their experience, are consistent and compact units. Even the elements of
exaggeration are quite in keeping with medieval tales. If they were not
followed by any legendary confirmation, they could be easily passed off as
amusing and adventurous tales, quite innocent in their constitution. But when
the author holds them up side by side with the Purāņic legends, their sarcastic
potency becomes at once apparent. The tales by themselves speak highly for
the skilful inventiveness of Haribhadra. As they stand, I think, they are
composed by Haribhadra himself, keeping in view the Purāņic legends to be
denounced. The stories thus are his creation ; but quite well-known in Indian
literature are some of their motifs : namely, a wild elephant pursuing a traveller;
people holding a fair in honour of a Yakşa; a robber-party attacking a caravan;
an ambitious youth pursuing the mirage of metallic transmutation by procuring
some juice from an inaccessible pond; etc. It is the use of these motifs that at
once lends a popular air and a sort of reality to the tales of rogues. The first
four stories illustrate the author's ingenuity as also the richness of his imagination,
whereas the story of Khandapānā shows his wit and fund of worldly wisdom.
Haribhadra has a special fascination for popular stories of humorous
and satirical style. Some of them in Prākrit he quotes in his commentary on
the Dasavaikālikasūtra. In one we have a group of Kārpaţikas; they begin
narrating their fantastical experiences; but a rational Srāvaka tries to expose
the weakness in the narration. In another context he quotes a fine dilemmatic
short story which reminds us of the dilemma of Khandapānā :3 In a certain
town there was a Parivrājaka who roamed about with a golden bowl declaring
that he would give it to one who narrated to him an unheard event. A
Śrāvaka addressed him thus, “Your father owed to my father one hundred
thousand coins : if you know this already, please return the amount; but if you
do not know it, please give the golden bowl as declared by you.' He also quotes

a fine satirical verse in Sanskrit, possibly summarising some earlier conversation
in Prākrit, made up of questions and answers. It is said to be put in the
mouth of a Dhūrta and addressed to a Buddhist monk who had a net-like
garment on his person. The verse may be freely rendered thus": "Sir, why is
your garment thread-bare? Well, it is for netting fish. Do you eat fish? I take
them when excited by wine. Do you drink wine? When I mate with a hetaera.
Do you visit a prostitute ? After kicking on the necks of my enemies. Whence
bave you enemies ? Those whose houses I have broken into. Are you a burglar?
Just for the purpose of gambling. Are you a Rogue? Because I am a slave.
girl's son.” These illustrate Haribhadra's acquaintance with and aptitude for
humorous and satirical folktales.
Haribhadra is an adept story-teller. If we casually glance through
his Samarāiccakahā, we find that he is well-informed about the workings of
human mind and about the human behaviour in general. His experience
is wide; naturally he creates characters and situations of engrossing interest
The Samarāiccakahā gives many counter tales which go to confirm the central
idea of the main story. He possesses a special liking for symbolical epilogues,
apparently meaningless, but full of significance and instruction when they are
explained. Enlightenment by absurd stories and situations is a fine weapon
which Haribhadra brandishes quite successfully. Arhaddatta (Sixth Bhava),
for instance, was enlightened when he was incurably attached to the pleasures
of body by telling him that he was as foolish as a person extinguishing fire
with grass. Absurd situations are presented illustrating such motifs. Similar
tendencies are seen in the Dhū. as well. The fantastic tales expose the
absurdity of Purāņic legends, and thus enlighten and correct those that put
faith in the Purāņic religion.
It is the agreement of rogues that supplies a graceful bracket for the
projection of the plot. Lest he would be required to give the stipulated feast,
every rogue is anxious to confirm the fantastic stories by quoting similar
Purāņic legends. It is in the fitness of things that every rogue should be
given the chance of confirming the experience of their female companion,
otherwise, if only one were to be given this chance, there would arise some
jealousy and others would not have the opportunity of being chivalrous. It
is not the story as a whole, but just some of the convenient points of it that
are selected for confirmation with one or more similar legends and episodes
from the epics and Purānas. The legends get automatically ridiculed, because
they are closely parallel to the incidents or points in the fantastic story. As
the rogues go on attempting to prove the impossible with the aid of Purāņio

legends, the legends themselves get ridiculed. Thus, to a certain extent, the
author is using tho mode of reductio ad absurdum in denouncing the legends.
All of them are confirmed rogues, quite expert in their business; and
it is not without some significence that they should be made to dabble in Purānic
legends, as if this was quite on par with their usual routine! It looks like a
bit of irony that the legends should be put in the mouth of rogues and that
they should come forth to prove the impossible by quoting them! Akhyāna
is usually a serious tale, especially an epical or Purāņic episode. It is certainly
à piece of pungent sarcasm, if Akhyāna refers here (V. 6) to the fantastic
tales narrated by rogues. If it refers to the series of Purāņic legends and
episodes, it is equally ironical that they should be put in the mouth of rogues
and that both of them should prominently figure in the title of the book!
Thus the plot, the mode and accessories of attack and even the title: all these
are not only appropriate but also partial and favourable for the artistic
performance which Haribhadra has achieved here. Even minor touches add
to the ironical flavour of the atmosphere: Müladeva declares that he is putting
up with parisaha such as hunger and thirst (I. 28), a veritable Jaina nonk
indeed!; Kaņdarika salutes the feet of Jina like a pious devotee (11. 24);
Khamdavāņā qualifies herself as atthārasa-dosavivajjiyā (V. 98), an adjective
usually applied to the Tirthakara ; and lastly, that hypocritically exacted tip
is glorified as a Dāna, a pious donation, which renders everything allright
(V. 102). There are some drawbacks: sometimes the same legends and
motifs are repeated and in some places there is some obscenity. As to the
first one wished that the author avoided this repetition; but as to the second,
it was inevitable, if the author wanted to expose the obscenity of some of the
Purāņic legends.
By assimilating different traditions Western literature has come to
possess an astonishing variety of literary expression. The fact becomes obvious
even to a superficial student of English literature, if he simply notes its chief
landmarks and growth. Scholars comparing the ancient Indian literature with
that of the English are struck with the manifold variety, range and artistic
áppeal in the latter. The disparity can be explained away on the basis
of the peculiar lines on which each civilization advanced. Apart from its
intrinsic merits and abiding values, in a way, by taking into account the
range of time covered by the civilization, the extent of the land and the
magnitude of the population, one has to admit that the ancient Indian
literature, available to us today, is comparatively small in quantity and
limited in variety. The reasons are apparent. On the whole, the Indian
mind has enjoyed the comfort of dignified isolation from constant foreign
influence. Religious spirit has permeated not only Indian life, but also
Indian literature: even secular compositions could not escape religio-moral
influence. Both men of letters and literary life in India are confined, as a rule,
to an insignificant minority of hereditory intellectual aristocrats. Antiquity
is an asset, but not necessarily a virtue. Old turns of expression and moulds of

thought gót stereotyped, and as conventions they had a metallic grip on ancient
Indian literature. Even the training of an Indian poet or author is of
a standardised cast: the aims are settled; the themes are dictated; type-chara-
cters are supplied; and even ready-made descriptions and stylistic devices are
kept at the disposal of an author in the making. Ordinary intellect goti
crippled, though sufficiently trained; it is only the extraordinary genius that
attempted to open new. literary paths somewhat deviating from the accepted
standards. In isolated branches of literature, the Indian mind exhibits
remarkable elevation, successful finish and consummate polish; but the lack of
variety is apparent everywhere. The fact that ancient India, which could
boast of the greatest master-pieces in epic poetry and certain kinds of fiction and
drama, has neither a tragedy after the manner of the Greeks nor satire in
Roman fashion is to be attributed to the peculiar way in which the Indian mind
evolved and the Indian author was trained for his job. The Sanskrit or even
Indian 'poetie theory of super-individual emotion and its complacent attitude
towards life!, as Dr. De remarks, precluded any serious cultivation of the
satiric type of literature."
Satire as a form of literature has been conspicuously absent in early
Indian literature. India, however, has not been lacking in literary geniuses
that were trained according to standard discipline. Every age has its follies
and faults; and these geniuses, on account of their righteous indignation and
as a wholesome correction, must have brandished their satirical whip against
social disorders and diseases. Such satirical compositions could not have
the same sanctity as that enjoyed by religious works; and it is not unlikely that
many specimens have not come down to us, even if the art of satire was duly
cultivated. Satire, moreover, is an indispensable stylistic quality in some forms
of literature; and the elements of this quality are found scattered, here and there,
in early Indian literature: in stories, in minor poems and in plays.
The Dasakumāracarita, on account of its setting, substance, characters
and events, is far from possessing the stereotyped orthodox outlook: in fact,
it is a remarkable contribution of a novel type in Sanskrit. It presents a lively
and realistic picture of the society, some glimpses of which we get in
the Mịcchakaţikam. Daņdin is unconventional by temperament. Though
it is not his aim to give his composition the form of a satire, he has easily meted
out some satirical lashes against gods who are dragged down to illustrate
the disgraceful deeds of the characters (pp. 29, 44), against Brāhmaṇas who are
greedy for wealth and divert themselves by cock-fighting (p. 96), against
hypocritical ascetics whose passion is easily enkindled (p. 44 f.), against
the Digambara Jaina monk who is made to confess the worthlessness of his mode
of life (p. 47 f.), and against Buddhist nuns who are ridiculed as go-betweens.
The adventurous tales of young princes have an enchanting grip on the reader's
mind; and Daņdin's tendency to ridicule certain aspects of the society by satire

DHURTĀKUYANA :
and caricature, quietly but effectively, is apparent in various places. In this
context attention may be drawn to the Bharataka-Dvātrimśikā, a late work of
the fourteenth century A. D. in popular Sanskrit. The term bharataka means
a kind of Saiva monks; and this collection of thirty-two tales is designed for
purposes of exposing the mūrkha-jana-carita so that one might understand
sadācarand. The Saiva monks are satirized by means of stories illustrating
their moral depravity and stupidity. The bharataka is made to quote the
parallels of gods and saints to justify his behaviour, thus ridiculing the gods and
saints as well with himself. Some of the stories exhibit a good fund of worldly
wisdom, wit and humour,
Somehow the element of satire seen in poems and plays is not of a very
high order: the art of satirising becomes bald abuse and coarse ridicule,
if it does not leave behind a healthy and correcting influence. The Kuțţinīmata
of Dāmodaragupta (c. 779-813 A, D.) is more erotico-comic than satiric,
Another polymath who has studiously worked in this line is Kșemendra,
of the middle of the eleventh century A. D. Some of his works deserve special
attention in this context. His Samayamātļkā deals with the traditional erotic
topics. It presents varied pictures of the society, and the situations are
sketched in a pointed style. «The merit of the work lies not in its unsavoury
story, but in its heightened, yet graphic, picture of droll-life, painted with
considerable sharpness of phrasing and characterisation, and with an undertone
of mocking satire directed against many forms of prevalent deformity." His
Darpadalana is equally interesting. His salutation to viveka in the opening
Mangala is quite significant. In seven sections it demonstrates the folly of pride
based on kuld, dhana, vidyā, rūpa, saurya, dāna and tapas. Besides the
gnomic verses on each, they are illustrated with tales invented for the purpose.
The form is interesting. More than once the author drags the Purāņic
deities and personalities on a lower plain by citing how they have not been
immune from these flaws (I. 17 f., III. 79 f., IV. 18 f., etc.). The moral tone
is quite predominant; and the attack on holiness, though casual, is sufficiently
pungent. His Kalāvilāsa is a satirical discourse in ten sections, put in
a legendary setting. The first chapter lashes the roguish hyprocrisy, dambha,
seen in different walks of life, found not only among men and women of
different classes but also among birds and vegetables. He is harsh on Gaudas;
and now and then even sacred deities and sages are not spared. The remaining
chapters deal with greed, erotic impulse, harlot, Kāyastha, pride, etc. His

Kāyastha, etc., are bitter and wounding. This work is thus a remarkable and
comprehensive discourse, with a legendary framework, on the various activities
of notorious tricksters known to Kșemendra; and his easy and elegant style
makes the descriptions amusing and the satire effective." As observed by
Dr. De, Kşemendra's compositions are 'noteworthy satirical sketches exaggerated
cum grano salis but substantially faithful, having less frequent lapses into
squalor or coarseness, and composed in the best literary manner of Kșemendra.
There is nothing of melancholy wisdom in Kşemendra. Knowing full well
the castigating use of satire, he deals out his blows too liberally, but with
precision, with bitter and often foul-mouthed presumption, but with the unerring,
insight of a shrewd observer'. Kşemendra's satirical writings assume all the
more importance, because his successors like Jahlaņa, Nīlakantha Diksita, etc.
never rose to his heights. They are all steeped in the time-honoured mould of
religious didacticism and hackneyed eroticism. Anxious to maintain respecta-
bility, they are afraid of descending to the repellent reality which their subject
demands, and only touch the fringe of it, from a safe distance, with the stick of
romantic verse.'
Among the plays, it is the Bhāna and the Prahasana types that
contain a great deal of satirical element. Bhāņa is a monologue play; the only
character is a Vița or Dhūrta who narrates, with imaginary questions and
answers and with various gestures, either his experience or that of others,
Most of the existing specimens of bhānas are comparatively modern and belong
to the South ; they lack variety and are of the same pattern, almost made to
order; and they are predominantly permeated with erotic sentiment, very often
coarse in taste. There is very little of genuine satire in them; we get, however,
satirical touches in the descriptions of the licentious Paurānika, the old Srotriya,
the fraudulent astrologer and (but this rarely) the Jangamas, Saivas and
Vaişņavas (as in the Sțngāratilaka).' The Hāsyacūņāmaņi of Vatsarāja
ridicules the Bhāgavatas; while the Mukundānanda pours a great deal of
pungent satire against the Gurjara people. Such satirical touches are almost
thrown into back-ground by their mechanichal characters, the roguish parasites
and the haterea and by excessive eroticism. The four Bhāņas, which are edited
as Caturbhāņia and which definitely belong to an earlier age, present 'more
variety, greater simplicity, a larger amount of social satire and comic relief, a
more convincing power of drawing individuals rather than types, easier and
more colloquial style, and some measure of real poetry in spite of certain
coarseness.” In the Padmaprābbrtaka, the Vița, Sasa by name, a friend of
Karnīputra Mūladeva (both of them of Ujjainī), gets a specified individuality.
The racy speeches of the Vița, in the Pādatāditaka, are remarkably satirical;

his ridicule is abundantly directed against the Lāțas and the Buddhist order; and
the Dāserakas, Saurāştras and Mālavas are not spared from casual hits. These
Bhāņas are often obscene, if not vulgar; and the primal sensations are portrayed
with a rough realism and terrible sincerety. For a student of literature, as Dr.
De rightly remarks, 'it is more than useless to read austere morals into these
old-time play-wrights or damn them for want of morals.
Turning to the Prahasana, the popular farce, there is ample scope for
social satire in it by the very nature of its subject-matter; but the specimens that
have survived are far from being satisfactory. Their wit and humour, which
would make one laugh, lie in deliberately vulgar exhibitions and expressions: in
short, the whole atmosphere in the Prahasana, on account of conventional
characters and incidents and the high-strung erotic sentiment, is low and
depressing. The Mattavilāsa of Mahendravikrama (7th Century A. D.) is a
slight farcical sketch depicting the drunken and passionate revelry of a Saiva
mendicant, calling himself a Kapālin on account of the human skull carried
by him in lieu of his alms-bowl which is said to be stolen by a hypocritical
Buddhist monk. A degenerate Pāśupata comes to settle the case of theft, and
finally the missing bowl is obtained from a madman who had retrieved it from a
dog. Thus the wreckless wrangling in the monastic order is broadly satiriseda
The Prahasanas like Lataka-melaka, Dhūrtasamāgama, etc. have much to do
with rogues and knaves; the Jaina and Buddhist monks are held in ridicule; but
with their symbolic characters, whatever little wit and satire they possess is
often defaced by open vulgarity and erotic descriptions. Stray satirical verses in
Sanskrit and Prākrit may be collected from anthologies and from illustrations on
the rhetorical device called vyāja-stuti; but they cannot, being isolated verses,
Eshibit contenu de incendo
exhibit any sustained style as such. Thus this survey leaves us cold that early
Indian literature has not achieved much in the field of satire.
Haribhadra is a genius by birth and a satirist by temperament. He
has bequeathed to posterity a valuable contribution to Indian literature througlı
his Dhūrtākhyāna which is unique in various respects. We might try to assess
its value, as a work of art, from the point of view of a modern critic of letters.
The terminology of English criticism' cannot be literally applied to Indian
works, because the terms have sometimes specified associations and import. The
Dhū. apparently looks like a parody in as much as it ridicules by imitation, but if
we go into details we find that it cannot be called a parody for various reasons:
no work or class of works is continuously ridiculed through word-, form- or
sense-rendering ; secondly, the imaginary tales narrated by rogues do not easily
remind us of any one story or of any work or class of works; thirdly, the legends
that are ridiculed do not come serially or at random from any one composition,
but they are heaped from different sources to hold in ridicule their common motif

a casually taking receve them, using parodi and episodes and
something like what is already noted in the invented tale; and lastly, there is no
deliberate attempt on the part of the author to confound issues by distortion or
exaggeration of facts. The Dhūrtākhyāna, therefore, can be better and more
appropriately called a satire of incredible Purāņic legends and episodes and
against the credulity of those that believe them, using parodical imitation as its
chief vehicle and casually taking recourse to irony, sarcasm, banter, wit and
humour. It is a satire, and a perfect one, because of its unique construction, a
delicious mingling of phantasy and reality, subtle sense of characterization
(though in a limited quantity) and above all the startling situation of devils
discussing scriptures which make it an inimitable piece of raillery and a good
humoured amusement for all. Haribhadra possesses a righteous indignation
which is passionate, noble and fearless. Like a true satirist, he thoroughly
ridicules rather objectively, in his Sambodha-prakaraña,the vices that had
perhaps crept into the Jaina monastic order of his times: he detests, pities and
condemns the vices and the irreligious routine of the ascetic life; while in the
Dhū. he satirizes the folly of the degenerating belief of the masses in Purāņic
legends. Monks are morally and religiously degraded, and the public is on the
verge of rational bankruptcy; and here Haribhadra comes like an expert surgeon
to ply his satirical instrument, before he can put the bandage of religious and
didactic teaching. Like Voltaire, Haribhadra was out to cure, and he had a
panacea, Reason. Haribhadra is a champion of rational and logical attitude;
he declares in one place: 'I am not partial to Mahāvīra, nor do I
bear any ill will against Kapila and others; whose words appeal to reason,
his mission is to be upheld. He has given vent to this spirit more
than once. The good satirist, we know, holds a place half-way between preacher
and the wit. He has the purpose of the first and uses the weapons of the second.
He must both hate and love. For what impels him to write is not less
the hatred of error and folly than the love of right and wise vision. The
satirist's appeal is always to the intellect, and rarely does he play upon
the emotions. His is a perfectly rational attitude strengthened by the nicest
sense of proportion. Like a rationalist, Haribhadra's approach is intellectual,
apart from his being a champion of logic and reason; but his still greater asset
is the mental poise with which he meets his opponents. He is not a logician
infuriated with religious fanaticism, but he is a genuine rationalist of a balanced
mind; and to a certain extent we see this even in the Dhūrtākhyāna. As
a genius Haribhadra has at his back a fund of good logic. Quite skilfully and.
humorously, like a creative artist, he applies it to the incredible Purāņic ideas
which have a sway over men's minds; the invented tales are full of logical
extremes and absurdities; and when the Parāņic legends are set on par with.

the veracity of invented tales are easily led to denounce the Purāņic legends.
With untiring assiduity he scrutinizes, sorts and shifts the Purāņic legends
according to their points of weakness, and pours them forth to substantiate
the most ridiculous extremes and distortions with the result that not only
the purpose of proving the unprovable fails but the Purāņic legends themselves
get ridiculed as improbable and absurd. The result is startling, though
inevitable. He satirizes the legends rather by exposing them by selection and
comparing them with ridiculously fantastic tales than by vehemently denouncing
them. As we see below, Haribhadra exhibits a remarkable intellectual honesty;
so far as the main motifs are concerned, he does not tamper with the Purāņic
legends: he does not distort them to ridicule them.
"The true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction', says
Dryden; and he is perfectly right in hitting at the end and aim of all great
satires so emphatically. Haribhadra has undoubtedly a religio-moral purpose,
hinted rather than elaborated (V. 122, 124), in writing this Ākhyāna. As has
been observed, the polished raillery and the good natured satire have an ethical
under-current, otherwise 'the satire which only seeks to wound is as dangerous
as arrows that fly in the dark”. It must be said to Haribhadra's credit that
the satirical artist in him has successfully, and also rightly, predominated over
the religious preacher in him. No artist can do more than set his practised
and controlled talent to work on the subject chosen and constantly developed for
him by the inspiration of his genius.' Our author just exercises his imagination
in the way laid down for him by his characters and circumstances; and one feels
that even if he had stopped his work at V. 109 (of course followed by V. 119-24).
nothing fundamental would have been missed. Nowhere does he show the
temptation of preaching moral lessons like a professional religious teacher.
Any other mediocre author would have introduced a Kevalin at the end to give
a dhamma-kahā whereby all the rogues would be turned into pious believers
who would ultimately reach liberation after observing saṁlehana. Haribhadra
has fully and rightly restrained himself from adding to his composition any such
conclusion so usual and normal in Jaina tales. The Dhūrtākhyāna, therefore,
has a literary form, nothing specially religious about it; it is an out-and-out
satire, an artist's creation; and as a literary product, it is far ahead of its time.
In fact, coming so early as in the 8th century A. D., Dhū. reveals such
an artistry and management of the material as one can simply marvel at.
Not even the works of Kşemendra, who does possess a satirical skill and whose
performance we have reviewed above, can match the Dhūrtākhyāna, which is
nearly three hundred years older than him, with regard to construction and
subtle satirical effect. Haribhadra is throughout an artist, while şemendra's
satire is overladen with and defaced by heavy didacticism. If one understands
our author's bhava-viraha as an escape from the tedium of life, Haribhadrasūri
will have the credit of hitting at an accepted standard of the greatness of satire
in modern times.

A CRITICAL STUDY

The characters introduced by Haribhadra are not altogether imaginary;
but, in fact, most of them are well-known figures in Indian popular tale and
picaresque literature. Mūlaśrī or Mūladevat is a famous character as a Jack of
all trades given to gambling and attached to courtezan Devadattā. It appears
that he had alternative names such as Karnīsuta, Mūlabhadra and Kalankura.
Even a treatise on theft or erotics is attributed to him by tradition. Certainly
he is an old figure. Haribhadra himself quotes a Prākrit story in his commen-
tary on the Daśavaikālika-sūtra (p. 57 f.) in which Mūladeva figures as a tricky
rogue. The Avantisundarīkathā (veres 7) mentions him; Bāņa also, in his
Kādambarī, refers to him with his friend Sasa; and both of them are introduced
(with Devadatta) in the Padmaprābhịtaka. He figures as a typical hero in
the Kalāvilāsa of Kșemendra. The Kathāsaritsāgara also gives his story, and
he is associated with the court of Vikramāditya. We get a Jaina edition of
the tale of Mūladeva and Devadattā quoted in Devendra's commentary on
the Uttarādhyayana”. Thus Mūladeva appears to have reached the status of
a popular hero ty pifying all that is tricky and roguish. The name Kamdariya
is met with in the Ardhamāgadhi canon®; he is not a rogue, but a worldly-
comfort-seeking character destined to go to hell. Jaina stories mention names
like Ilāputra and Aşādhabhūti; and according to the Abhidhāna-Rajendra,
Elāşādha is a famous rogue from Avanti referred to in the Niſītha-cūrņi“.
Śaśa, as noted above, appears to have been a close associate of Mūladeva.
We do not know anything about Khamdavāņā from other sources : her name
has a popular ring and baffles Sanskritic etymology. Though most of the
characters are already known, there is very little of characterization in the
Dhūrtākhyāna. It is only Khaņdapānā, with her coarseness and sharp
intellect, that is a bit individualized. She is a good combination of
a woman and a rogue. She is intelligent, hypocritical, scheming and witty;
her success in getting the wealth from the merchant is quite worthy of her
nature and trade; without any difference of opinion she becomes the President
of Rogues; and she smashes the vanity and satisfies the appetite of her
colleagues by a well-earned and sumptuous feast. One wishes that Haribhadra
spent more labour and greater insight in making the characters and stories more
individualistic as has been done by Chaucer in his immortal Canterbury Tales.

DAŪRTAKHYANA :
The live
The literary device.of.picaros narrating their experience with a satirical
vein is seen to a certain extent in the Dasakumāracarita and in the Bhāņa
type of dramas, but the manner in which and the purpose for which Haribhadra
has adopted it is remarkable. We know some of his successors like Amitagati
etc., but we are absolutely in the dark about his predecessors in the field.
The form, however, is dramatic in which characters are made to speak;
Haribhadra tells us that it was narrated as a tale (V. 123), and not enacted
as a play; but with minor changes the whole piece can be turned into a fine
Prahasana of open satire.
The most astonishing thing about the Dhūrtākhyāna is not that it is
satirical, nor that it is one of the rare pieces of the kind in early Indian
literature, but that it should be so thoroughly modern both in thought
and spirit, and such a master-piece of construction. Most of the Roman or
the English satire is cast in the mould of a dream or an allegory. This makes
it stilted and artificial. It is only in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Boccacio's
Decameron that an ingenious frame-work is used to impart an air of reality
to the narration. The device of emboxing stories within a story is a common
trait in most of the Indian sagas. Apart from this consideration, the
frame-work of the Dhūrtākhyāna is certainly one of its notable features.
The rogue-chiefs, each telling a fantastic story of his own and asking others
to prove its truth or to accept defeat and give feast to rest of them, as they
were all hungry during the rainy week and had run thither into the garden
in order to manage to get food, afford the satire an amusing yet natural
setting. The truth of their wonderful and wild stories is immediately proved
by parallels from the Bhārata, Rāmāyaṇa and Purāņas. The last chief
who is a female recounts a number of autobiographical incidents which are
likewise regarded as credible. But then, all this still keeps the main problem
unsolved ! How are they to get food for themselves and for their retinue?
Their female accomplice proposes that she would give them a feast only if
they acknowledged her supremacy. This they would never accept. She then,
continuing her narration, leads it to such a point that they have to recognize
her. suzerainty or give feast. Thus the woman is triumphant, and her wit
and wisdom enable them all to satisfy their most immediate need of food.
The impossible yarns concocted by the Rogues, the replies thereto, and above
all the witty and surprising end of the story reveal its architectonic skill and
the beauty of design. The Dhūrtākhyāna has a unity and compactness
that can be distinctly felt; and except for the one or two obscene references
and blunt outspokenness and crudity of Khaņdapānā's experience, there is
nothing superfluous or inartistic in the satire. Besides, its perfectly original
structure is one of its highest distinctions, and sufficient by itself to proclaim
the author's genius.
In speaking of the unity of the Dhūrtākhyāna it was the organic
unity, therefore unity of form and spirit both, that was hinted at. Even though
there is an indirect reference in favour of Jainism at the close of the work

Page 59****************************************************************************************
A CRITICAL STUDY
as cornering and outwittity
dilemmatic situaties is a brilliant example
(V. 121-22), the satire as a whole is general, direoted against credulity and
superstition that deaden man's reasoning faculties and lead him away from
the path of Truth. According to accepted critical standards, it is modern and
not medieval, and it is more Horacian than Juvenalian. It is throughout
rational and convincing. It shall be as well called good-humoured, as there is no
deliberate attempt to distort or exaggerate facts or indulge in repeated ranoour.
The main point is that we should not be foolishly credulous and accept
the mythological stories as literally true. As seen below, almost all the
references to Parāņas, etc. are traceable to their origins. The author is always
implioit, and never vituperative in his criticism, and makes an intelligent use
of dilemma, not only to prove or disprove things but also to give a witty
air to everything that is ridiculed. Khandapānā's cornering and outwitting
her male accomplices is a brilliant example of this device. The use of such
dilemmatic situations has given a logical tone (quite inevitable and essential in
the work of an outstanding logician like Haribhadra) and balance to the
narration. Except for a few repetitions (elephant-pursuit, mating with Sun,
Wind etc.), the story has the fullest variety with its strange, mysterious,
awe-inspiring and terrible phantasies set in a realistic back-ground and provided
with a rollicking humorous close. Some of the descriptions, short or long,
for instance that of the cemetery, are quite epical in style and make-up.
The story element in the frame-work is comparatively slight, but has gained
a remarkable poise because of Khandapānā's flashing victories over her partners
and the banker whom she dupes by her superior intelligence and womanly wiles.
The precocious genius of the author", obvious in this unique work,
indeed, provides a delightful field for researches in literary developments;
and it is hoped that the publication of this edition of Dhūrtākhyāna will inspire
others to unearth still richer treasures that lie buried in the literature of
ancient India
4. Sources of the Purānic Legends
Throughout the Dhū., in order to confirm the fantastic tale narrated
by one Dhūrta, other Dhūrtas have presented a series of Epic and Purāņio
legends. It is necessary to study them, wherever possible, in comparison with
1 Most of the works of Haribhadra are yet to be studied critically. The following are
the chief sources where some points about his life, works and date are discussed.

the legends as preserved in present-day texts. Haribhadra is not very particular
in mentioning his sources, specifying the work and its author. Usually he
refers to them in general terms like Sruti, Purāņa etc. (I. 14, 31, 35, 53, 89;
II. 27, 51; III. 20, 53, 88; IV. 15, 27; V. 11, 64); Bhārata? and Rāmāyaṇa,
however, are repeatedly mentioned (I. 14, 31, 35, 41, 82, 85; II. 27, 62; III. 20,
93; IV. 14, 15, 19; V. 60, 119); and there are single references to Vişņupurāņa
and Arapya-paryan (of the Bhārata) and also to Vyāsa, the author of Bhārata
(II. 27; II. 31; I. 41). Once Arthaśāstra is casually mentioned (V.1) but
not as a source. In the following paragraphs are presented the Legends found
in the Dhū., their sources traced by us, and critical remarks on the same in
some cases,
I. *1*. 37–38: FOUR VARNAS IN BRAHMAN’s Body. - Ķgveda X. 90. 12;
Mahābhārata, Aranyaka-parvan (critical ed.), 187. 13.
I. *2*. 39–40: Hara's MALE ORGAN. — Vāyupurāņa (Anandāśrama
ed., 1905), chap. 55. 23-28. – Verse 26 mentions that they tried to measure
its limits for one thousand years.
I. *3*, 41-51: BIRTH OF KICAKAS (Bhārata of Vyāsa). -- [?]. -
Haribhadra specifically mentions the Bhārata of Vyāsa as his source. According
to Mbh., Virāțaparvan (critical ed.), App. I, p. 313, passage No. 19, Kekaya,
a Sūta king, had from his wife Mālavī one hundred and six sons of whom Kicaka
was the most mighty and was appointed as the commander by the Virāța king.
This is all that we learn about their origin; and in this context the legendary
details noted by Haribhadra are not found. Kīcaka does mean a hollow bamboo.
1. *4*. 52: GANGĀ FOILED IN Hara's Jaļā. - Rāmāyaṇa (Nirņaya-
sāgara ed. 1921), Bālakāņda, 43. 9. - Haribhadra says vāsa-sahassaṁ, while
in the Rāmā. we have samvatsara-gaņān bahūn.
I. **. 53–7: BIRTH OF BRAHMAN. -- Mbh., Āraṇyaka-parvan (critical
ed.), App. I, pp. 1084-5, passage No. 27, especially II. 13-30. -- There is some
Terbal agreement with the Mbh. passage; but in this context it is not mentioned
that Brahman came out with Daņda etc. and that the lotus was stuck, as noted
by Haribhadra. According to the Vāyupurāņa, chap. 55. 14, Brahman is
equipped with Kamandalu.
I. *6*. 58–84: i) TILOTTAMĀ RUINS BRAHMAN'S AUSTERITIES”; ii) BIRTH
OF DROŅĀCĀRYA; iii) BIRTH OF SVEDA- AND RAKTA-KUNDALIN ; iv) KARNA BORN
THROUGH THE EAR (Bhārata). - i) Mbh. Adi. (critical ed.) 201 ff. and Matsya-
purāņa (Anandāśrama ed. 1907), Adhyā. 3. 31 f.; ii) Mbh. Adi. (critical ed.),
57. 89, 121. 3-5, 154. 1-5; iii) Padmapurāņa (Anandāśrama ed. 1894),
Sșştikhanda, Adhyā. 14; iv) [?]. - i) According to Adiparvan 201 ff.,
Viśvakarman, at the instruction of Pitāmaha (203. 10-17), created Tilottamā,
a veritable mine of jewels of beauty, for the destruction of Sunda and Upasunda,
1 Haribhadra uniformly mentions Bhārata and never Mahābhārata.
2 The legend is split up for referential convenience. A story, much similar to No. 1;
is found in the Brhat Kathākośa of Harişeņa (Bombay 1943), chap. 99.

She was called Tilottamā, because she was made from small portion of every
kind of gem. Mahadeva developed four faces to look at her as she went round
(203. 23–25). According to the Matsyápurāņa, however, Brahman created
Satarūpā out of his body; and to look at her, he developed four faces (in four
directions) with a fifth on the head. This temptation ruined his austerities.
ii) Haribhadra attributes Drona's birth to Pasupati and Umā, but according
to Mbh, it is attributed to Bhāradvāja and Ghrtācī, the circumstances being
similar. iii) Though the names noted by Haribhadra are not given, the
Padmapurāņa narrates a story quite similar to this in the context of the earlier
births of Arjuna and Karna. Brahman produced a man from the perspiration
of his forehead. According to the Padma., Vişņu offered blood from his arm.
iv) Karņa is considered to be the amsa of the Sun by whom he was generated
from Kunti (Mbh. Ādi., 57. 82, 61. 89); and his birth is described at length in
the Ādi. 104. But I do not find any reference to his being born from the ear.
The Mbh. mentions, however, that he was born with the Kavaca.
I. *7*. 85-88: HANUMAT CROSSES THE OCEAN (Rāmāyaṇa). - Rāmā-
yaņa, Sundarakāņda, Sarga 1, verses 27, 54, Sarga 2, verse 2, etc. - The
Rāmāyaṇa gives a graphic description how Hanumat jumps (his long arms and
the root tr being more than once mentioned) across the ocean. The Sanskrit
quotation put in the mouth of Hanumat I have not been able to spot in
the Nirņayasāgara ed, in this context.
I. *8*. 89–92: Hara RECEIVES GANGA ON HIS HEAD. – Rāmāyaṇa,
Bālakāņda, Sargas 42, 43 (verse 3 f.); Mbh. Aranyaka., 108. 9 f.; see also
the remarks on I. *4*. 52 above. - Mbh. simply describes how Gangā was
received by Hara; and there is no reference to her vanity as in the Rāmāyaṇa.
II. *1*. 27-30: PRIMORDIAL EGG (Vişņupurāņa). – Vişnupurāņa,
Wilson's Translation (London 1864), Book I, chap. II, pp. 39-40; Mbh. Ādi.
(critical ed.) 1. 27 f.; Matsyapurāņa, 2. 32 ff.; Brahmapurāņa (Anandāśrama ed.
1895), 1. 40f. - This is described almost in every Purāņa.
II. *2*. 31-39: THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IN A CHILD'S STOMACH ( Araṇya-
parvan). - Mbh., Aranyakaparvan, 186. — The details closely agree with
a few common words even. According to our text, it is the Sage that calls
the Boy; but in the Mbh. the Boy calls the Sage asking him to take shelter in
his stomach (verses 88-9). The Mbh. says that Mārkandeya was in the
stomach of that Boy only for varşānām adhikaṁ satan (verse 110); but
according to Haribhadra divvam vāsa-sahassaṁ. The Boy is none other than
Vişnu-Krşņa, as it is clear from the names like Srīvatsadhārin, Pitavāsā,
Puņqarikākşa etc.
II. *3*, 40-41: KES’AVA IN DEVAKI'S WOMB. - Bhāgavata (Nirņaya-
sāgara ed.) 10. 7. 34–36; also the references on II. *2*. 31-39 above. - When
1 The Sanskrit Text (verse No. 102) mentions Bhārata also along with Vişnupurāņa,
2 The Sanskrit Text (verse 106) mentions Araṇyapatha, a Šāstra; but I feel no doubt
that Haribhadra is referring to a Parvan of that name in the Mbh.

Page 62****************************************************************************************
AP
DHURTĀKHYĀNA:
Yaśodā was feeding Krşņa, she happened to see the whole universe in his mouth
which he opened while yawning.
II. *4*. 42-50; BRAHMAN AND KES'AVA, - Compare Väyupurāņa,
Adhyā. 24; see also the references on I. *5*. 53–7. - A legend somewhat
corresponding to Haribhadra's version is found in the Vāyu. Brahman once
approached Nārāyaṇa who was sleeping on the great serpent in the ocean and
who had produced a dignified lotus out of his navel for his sport. They do not
recognise each other, and each one claims that he is the Adikartā. First Vişnu
enters the stomach of Brahman and sees the whole universe there, but could not
reach the end even after one thousand years; so he comes out of his mouth.
Then Brahman enters Vişnu's stomach and experiences the same. When Vişnu
closed the outlets of his body, Brahman assumed a subtle form, came out
through the lotus stalk, and took his seat on the lotus. There is some jealousy
between the two; but it is quieted on Brahman being admitted as the putra of
Vişņu (verses 57-53) born from his navel-lotus.
II. *5*. 51–61: The Mighty Bow OF DRUPADA.-Compare Mbh., Ādi.
(critical ed.) 174ff.-The Adi. describes the bow as drąham, anāyaniyam
(176. 9), devadattan (foot-note p. 716, No. 1809*), samhanopapannam
(178. 15). Is it that Haribhadra's Mbh. text read 178. 13 as an adjective of
kārmukam in verse 15? Then alone the bow can be possessed of Nāgas etc.
According to the Mbh.Kịşņa and Bhima are present at the gathering but
merely as spectators. Siśupāla is humiliated, as noted by Haribhadra (Sasipālo
being perhaps a misreading); but the passage concerned is found only is S
(foot-note p. 725, No. 1828*) and not included in the critical text.
II. *6*. 62-74: HILL-LIKE JAPĀTO (Rāmāyaṇa).—Compare Rāmāyaṇag.
Araṇyakāņda, 50-53.-The opposition of Jațāyu when Rāvana carried Sītā,
their mutual fight, Jațāyu wounded by the sword of Rāvaņa: all these events
are described in the Aranyakāņda. Further that dying Jațāyu gives all the
đetails to Rāma, accompanied by Lakşmaņa (Sarga 67), and dies in their
presence. They perform the last rites (Sarga 68). According to Haribhadra,
Sītā blesses Jaţāyu that he would get wings after meeting Rāma's messenger;
Hanumat, in his search for Sītā, meets Jațāyu who gives him all the details
about her and who gets back his wings after meeting him; but I see no proper
context for these in the present text of the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki. Jațāyu is,
however, qualified in the Rāmāyaṇa as parvata-sngābhaḥ (50. 2). The Mbh.,
Aranyaka. (critical ed.), 262-63, which gives this episode, describes Jaţāyu
thus: Jatāyur giri-gocaraḥ ( 262. 41 ), grdhran nihatam parvatopamam (263.15).
III. *1*. 21-25: RENUKĀ REVIVED TO LIFE.-Mbh., Aranyakaparvan
(critical ed.) 116.-That the trees respected her chastity is not specifically
mentioned in the Mbh. The name of the king in the Mbh. is. Citraratha
and not Aśvāpahỉta as given by Haribhadra.
III. *2*. 26: CONSTITUTION OF JARĀSANDHAMbh., Sabhāparvan
(Madras 1932), Adhyāyas 19 (verses 54–55), 20 (verses 1-7). His name is
explained thus : Jarayā saṁdhito yasmāj Jarāsaſdho bhavatvayama

fruits, her lam(66.24). The un, on the left Shto which it is Imat's life in
III. *3*. 27–37 : SUNDA AND NISUNDA DESTROYED BY TILOTTAMĀ.--Mbh.,
Ādi. (critical ed.), 201-4.-Upasunda of the Mbh, is called Nisunda by
Haribhadra; perhaps it is a contamination with Nikumbha, the name of the
father of Sunda and Upasunda. According to Mbh., Tilottamā was created by
Viśvakarman, at the instruction of Pitāmaha, by putting together all that was
beautiful in the three worlds. She was like Lakşmī, and her body was a
veritable mine of jewels (203. 12–17). Haribhadra, however, says that she was
created by taking bits from gods.
B. III. *4*. 38-44: HANUMAT PIECED TOGETHER.--Compare Rāmāyaṇa;
Kişkindhā-kāņda, 66. 8-28, also Uttara-, 35–36.---Hanumat's life in his
childhood is given in the Rāmāyaṇa according to which it is Indra that wounded
him, while he jumped at the Sun, on the left chin whereby he came to be known
as Hanumān (66.24). The instruction of the mother that he should eat red
fruits, her lamentation, smashing of his body by the Sun's kick, subsequent
piecing together of the same, and the substitution of the chin: all these events,
though referred to by Haribhadra, are not mentioned in the Rāmāyaṇa in the
above contexts.
III. *5* 46-52: HANUMAT BRINGS WOUND-HEALING MEDICINE.
Rāmāyaṇa, Yuddha-kāņda, Sarga 101, also Sarga 74 (especially verse 70) and
Sarga 50.—The details noted by Haribhadra are practically covered by the
above contexts in the Rāmāyaṇa..
III. *6* 53–86: BIRTH OF MAHASENA.—Compare Mbh., Aranyaka-
parvan (critical ed), 213–14; Brahmapurāņa, Adhyā., 128.7-23; Matsyapurāņa,
chap. 158. 26.; Vāyupurāņa, Chap. 72.--According to the Mbh., Svābā, the
daughter of Dakşa, satisfied the passion of Agni by assuming the forms of the
six wives of Saptarsis (excepting Arundhatī, whose form she could not assume).
She received the semen in hand; and with a desire that she should not be seen,
she flew taking the form of a Garudī. The semen was dropped in a golden pot
six times, and therein was born Mabāsena with six heads etc. He is also called
Rudra's son, Rudra being identified with Agni (218, 27f.) and Svāhā with
Umā (220.9). According to the Brahma- and the Matsya-purāņa, Agni
assumes the form of a parrot and approaches Sambhū and Umā. Agni drops
semen in the Křttikās and Kārtika was thus born. Haribhadra plainly says
devo gabbh'uvaghāyan viciặtami, but the Sanskrit and Gujarāti versions
indicate that gods wanted from Siva and Umā a son who would destroy
Tārakāsura. Something like the legend which Haribhadra has in view is found
in the Vāyupurāņa. The text of Vāyupurāņa admits a sad confusion of various
myths about Mabāsena, but it clearly says that Indra did not want any issue to
be born from Samkara and Umā; so he sent Agni to them. The concluding
details are slightly different. Seeing that the semen had fallen out of her body,
Umā forced Agni to hold it in his stomach; he later sought the help of Gangā
who delivered in a Himālayan valley; and a mighty son was born.

Adi. (critical ed.), 17. 4-8.-The corresponding story in the Mbh. runs thus :
The Sun and Moon reported to Vişņu that Rāhu, under the guise of a god, was
just drinking nectar churned from the ocean. Vişņu immediately cut his head
which began eclipsing the Sun and Moon with enmity towards them.

Text).Mbh., Adi. (critical ed.), 145–152.-The critical edition describes the
demon's share of food at 148. 6; but more detailed descriptions of it are found
in different recensions of the Mbh.: see Ādi (critical ed.), p. 942, passage Nos.

IV. *7*, 31-87: THE MIGHTY GARUDA. - Mbh. Ādi. (critical ed.),
14-32. - These chapters practically cover all the details noted by Haribhadra.
There are, however, some points of specific difference: The Mbh, notes only
two eggs (14. 12) of Vinatā giving birth to Aruņa and Garuda, while Dhū.
mentions one more egg which was impatiently opened first and which produced
a scorpion. Secondly, it is the mother, according to Mbh., that tells Garuda
the whereabouts of the nectar and that asks him to eat Nişādas ( 24. 2); but
according to Haribhadra it is Kāśyapa, the father, that gives these instructions.
Thirdly, the Mbh. does not connect the dropping of Vața tree with Lankā.
Isastly, Vişņu is quite partial to Garuda almost from the beginning in the Mbh.

As distinguished from the above legends, the sources of which we have
tried to trace, there are some casual references in the Dhū. (I. 62–4; V. 114-18)
to Purāņic personalities and events. Some of them are mere names; so some
additional information may be noted here from second-hand sources,
Haribhadra expresses (once through the mouth of Indra) that
Mahāvīra alone is an exception; and that all other so-called great personalities
have been victims of cupidity and womanly temptations (I. 64-4), or of
passions in general (V. iii): Gautama had a wife Ahalyā by name; at times,
whenever taken as identical with Dīrghatamas, he is painted to be quite
voluptuous.--Vasiştha had for his wives Urjā, Arundhati etc.; and he had one
hundred sons.-Parāśara, unmindful of place and time, fell in passionate love with
Satyavatī, the fisher-girl.-Jamadagni demanded, from king Reņu, Renukā in
marriage; he had five sons from her; but he was a terribly suspicious husband.
Kaśyapa had more than a dozen wives and a pretty large number of sons.-
Agastya once realized that his ancestors could not be rescued without his
begetting a son. Then he formed a girl out of the most graceful parts of
different animals and passed her secretly into the palace of the king of Vidarbha.
When the child grew up, he demanded her in marriage; somehow the king
consented; and she became his wife Lopāmudrā. To satisfy his wife, who had
grown up in palace, he begged wealth from different kings.-Indra selected
Indrāņī to be his wife because of her voluptuous attractions; he employed
celestial nymphs to excite the passions of holy men; he is called parastra
kāma-cūrin, a habitual adulterer; he tried to seduce Ruci, wife of Devasarman;
and his endevour to seduce Ahalyā, wife of the sage Gautama, is well-
known.-Hara's attachment for Umā, who occupies half of his body, is often
mentioned in the Purāņa.--Vişnu has his wife in Lakşmī; and in his incarnation
of Krşņa, he had 16000 wives, apart from his sports with Gopīs to whom he is
so much attached (V. 112-13).-Candra has twenty-seven wives, of whom
Rohiņi is the most favourite. He carried off Tārā, the wife of Bệhaspati,
from whom he had a son Budha by name.--Vāyu generated Bhīma from Kunti
and Hanumat from Añjanā. The hundred daughters of Kušanābha would not
comply with his licentious desires, so he made them crooked in physique; and
thus their city came to be called Kanyā-kubja.--Yama-Dharma had several wives
as Hemalatā etc. Dharma, one of the Prajāpatis, had married thirteen (or ten)
of the daughters of Dakşa, and had a numerous progeny. He generated
Yudhisthira from Kuntī.

In conclusion, Haribhadra refers to a series of legends, particularly the
births of Purāņic personages (V. 114–18), and summarily denounces them as
unnatural and unworthy of any credence. Some of them, viz., the births of
Brahman (1. 53–7), Tilottamā (1. 58–84; III. 27-37), Droņa (I, 60-61),
Şaņmukha (III. 53–86), and of Svedakundalin and Nara, i. e., Raktakundalin
(I. 58–84) are already referred to in the earlier discussion; and we have
noted the relevant sources above. Some particulars about the rest may be
added here: There is a legend that (Pavana-?) Ganapati originated from the
scurf of Pārvati's body.--Urvaší was so named, because she was born from the
thigh..Nalakūbara and Manigrīva were excessively drunk and sporting in
a nude condition in the river Ganges. When Nārada came there, the ladies
clothed themselves; but these two remained naked. Nārada was offended, and
cursed them to become trees for one hundred years. They were relieved by the
contact of Krşņa who pulled the mortar, to which he was tied by his mother,
through the interspace between the pair of Arjuna trees in which they were
transformed.—Vasudeva and Devakī were in the prison of Kamsa, and it is
there that Devakī conceived Balarāma. But in the seventh month, through the
mediation of Māyā, the embryo was transferred to the body of Rohiņi who was
staying at Gokula. This Balarāma of the Yādava race is considered to be an
ansa of Seşa --Pārvatī is the daughter of Himālaya and Menā.
The success of Haribhadra's performance depends primarily, if not
entirely, on the intellectual integrity and fidelity with which he has presented
the Purāṇic legends that are being satirised. We can start prima facie that he
would not dare to change the popular, mythological stories, at least their
fundamentals, current in his locality and at his time; for, if he were to do so, he
would be cutting the very ground under his feet, and his work would fall in the
estimation of his contemporaries to whose gathering it has been already narrated
at Citrakūta ( V. 123).
On the whole, we have been fairly successful in tracing the countera
parts of the legends, quoted by Haribhadra, to their sources available today.
Haribhadra is not actually quoting in the very words of the original, but he
is rewriting the legends in his words and mostly from memory, Naturally we
will have to make ample concession for omissions and minor variations in
expression and presentation. In some cases, Haribhadra's legends, when
studied in comparison with those in the present-day texts, show differences in
details. Their significance depends upon their position in the story and on their
relative bearing for the purpose of denunciation. Some divergences are of minor
significance: for instance, the names of the parents of Droņa (1. *6*); whether
the Sage called the Boy or vice versa (11. *2*); whether Reņukā's chastity was
respected by plants (III. *1*); whether Upasunda or Nisunda is the name
(III. *3*); whether Vinatā laid two eggs or three (IV. *7*); whether
Yudhişthira asked the boa seven questions or more (V, *8*); etc. Such
differences do not affect the chief idea that is selected as the target for the
satirical shaft. There are other differences of major significance : for instance,

DAŬRTĀKRYĀNA :
whether, according to the Purāņic legend, Kicakas were accommodated in and
born from bamboo-hollows (I. *3*); whether the lotus was caught stuck at
Vişnu's navel (I. *5*); whether Karna was born through the ear (I. *6*);
whether Drupada’s bow is described in the epic to contain Nāgas etc. (II. *5*);
whether Hanumat climbed the mountain-like Jaţāyu (II, *6*); etc. If these
events have no basis in the Purāņic stories, the very edge of Haribhadra's
criticism is blunted; and his denunciation of Purāņic legends becomes
impertinent.
Hot Before we raise the question, whether Haribhadra has really taken
liberty with some of the legends, we have to remember that our epics and
Purānas have not come down to us exactly in the same form in which they
were current at the time of Haribhadra. Their texts have been subjected to so
many vicissitudes in different localities and for centuries together that the
authenticity of every episode, nay of every passage, is to be judged on its
own merits. This is fully demonstrated by the critical edition of the
Mahābhārata. The condition of the text-tradition of the Purāṇas is much worse.
They present such an indiscriminate fusion of text-tradition and such a
bewildering medley of myths that the wits of a text-critic would be completely
stunned. Very good results have been achieved by the study of Mbh. Mss.;
and the late lamented Dr. V.S. Sukthankar has brilliantly sketched the pros and
cons of the text-variation in the Mbh, in his following observations?: “All the
difficulties in the explanation of this phenomenal variation vanish, however, as
soon as we assume that the epic was handed down from bard to bard originally
by word of mouth, as is clearly implied by tradition. That would explain,
without any strain or violence, the existence of the mass of variants, of differences
in sequence and of additions and omissions. If the text has been preserved, for
any considerable period of time, only in memory and handed down by word of
mouth, those are just the changes that could not possibly be avoided. It is
evident that no great care would be lavished on the text by these custodians of
the tradition to guard it against corruption and elaboration, or against arbitrary
emendation and normalization: to reproduce the received text, which was not
guarded by canonical authority or religious sanction, with any degree of precision
would be neither attempted by the bards nor required of them. Whenever and
wherever the text was then written down-and it was probably written down
independently in different epochs and under different circumstances--these
transmissions by word of mouth must have contaminated the written text and
innumerable variations in it. The assumption of some such complicated
derangement, beyond the normal vicissitudes of transmission, is necessary to
account for the abnormal discrepancies and strange vagaries of the Mahābbārata
manuscript tradition. In other words, we are compelled to assume that even
in its early phases the Mahābhārata textual tradition must have been not uniform
and simple, but multiple and polygenous," In another context Dr. y. S.
Sukthankar has observed thus with regard to citations, and what is true about
1 The Adiparvan, Poona 1933, Prolegomena, p. 79.

then nearly holds good with regard to legends and their contents: "Then in the
case of citations we must allow for failures of memory, and the quotation was
never compared with the original. Moreover we must never forget that probably
from time immemorial there have existed local versions of the Mahābhārata.
The citations made even by very old writers were from these local versions. A
citation by a writer of the eighth century or even the sixth century proves
nothing for the Ur-Mahābhārata, that ideal but impossible desideratum; though
the citation is far older than our manuscripts, it is evidence only for the text of
the local Mahābbārata in the eighth, respectively in the sixth century, not
withstanding that the differences between the various recensions and versions of
the Mahābhārata must diminish as we go back further and further."
No doubt there must have been Mss, of the epics and Purâņas
(III. 53) in the days of Haribhadra, but generally the narratives were heard
from the mouth of rhapsodists. That they were handed down by word of
mouth, as suggested by Sukthankar, is to a very great extent confirmed by the
fact that, whenever Haribhadra appeals to the authority of Purānas etc., he
uses almost uniformly terms like suvvai, suan, etc. (I. 35, 41; II. 27, 31, 61;
III. 27, 38, 53, 65, 93; IV. 19, 27; V. 11, 33, 37, 60, 64, 112, 114; etc.). It is
not unlikely, therefore, that some discrepancies in the details, whether minor
or major, might go back to the traditional narration which was recited round
about Citrakūta at the time of Haribhadra; and we can hardly hope to trace the
same necessarily in the present-day texts. It is equally possible, in some cases
where Haribhadra's statements show deviation from the sources, that he is
criticising the legends which passed as such according to the tradition from
which he got them. One cannot be dogmatic on one or the other explanation,
because the sources, so far tapped, are comparatively limited. Further, when
legends are quoted from memory, contamination, confusion and variation in details
are inevitable. The very fact that most of the legends or their nearest counter-
parts we have been able to trace to their sources clearly indicates that
Haribhadra did not want to put forth imaginary legends and then to condemn
them. Though it is quite plain, it may be noted that the sources recorded by
us do not indicate that all those works are necessarily older than Haribhadra,
but it only means that those legends belong to a period earlier than that of
Haribhadra. He mentions only three works by name, Bhārata, Rāmāyaṇa and
Vişnupurāņa; and all other sources are our suggestions.
At times there is no agreement even among the Purāņic legends. For
instance, according to one version, Agni was sent by gods to Siva and Umā for
a mighty son who can destroy Tārakāsura; while, according to another version,
though less popular, he was sent by Indra to prevent Umā from conceiving a
child. Haribhadra narrates clearly the latter version, though the Sanskrit and
Gujarāti versions of the Dhū. read there, wrongly of course, the popular
legend. The legend given by Haribhadra has its place in the present-day
Váyupurāņa, as noted above. It is interesting to note that, in some cases

pedition of the Mbb.nges recorded in the foot legends are more sp
(I. *5*; II. *5*, IV. *3*), the details of the legends are more specifically traced
in the additional passages recorded in the foot-notes and Appendix of the critical
edition of the Mbh. That only means, the recension of the Mbh. which
reached Haribhadra's ears was more inflated than our critical text which is
constituted according to well-established and judiciously evolved canons of text
criticism based on the available Mss.
Some of the legends quoted by Haribhadra appear to have been
pieced together from different sources, even with mutual contamination (I. *6*;
III. *3*). It is creditable to Haribhadra that the number of such cases is quite
small. This is inevitable in those days when one had to depend mainly on
memory, which was a storehouse of all traditional lore, and not on books,
aś we do today.
Among the legends, the sources of which Haribhadra has clearly
mentioned, some are found in the present-day texts with substantial agreement
in details (1. *7*; II. *1*, *2*; III. *9* V. *7*); but in three cases (I. *3*,
*6*; II. *6*), though the sources are given as Bhārata and Rāmāyaṇa, we do
not find any passages in the present-day texts to support Haribhadra. That
Karna was born from Kunti's ear is a common story, quite popular even to this
day, though not found in the Mbh.; and it is not surprising, if it was current in
the days of Haribhadra too. First, karna means the ear, and popular
etymology would certainly weave out such a story; secondly, there is as well a
psychological motive, namely, by Karna's birth through the ear Kunti's virginity
remains intact, his generation by Sūrya being after all miraculous, nay super-
natural. Though Mbh. makes no mention of such a legend, I think, the
birth of Kīcakas from kīcakas or bamboo-hollows is similarly based on popular
etymology; such a legend might have been current in the days of Haribhadra;
and it is quite in tune with a host of legends in the epics and Purāņas with
which the 'miraculous germination of the semen into human beings' is a regular
apparatus for the generation of the great men of the past about whose birth
nothing exciting was specially known to the chronicler. Coming to the episode
of Jaţāyu, the epics do mention the mountain-like shape of Jațāyu; and thereby
Haribhadra's purpose is served. But the details of the story cannot be fitted in
the present mould of Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa. Haribhadra is quoting a Sanskrit
verse? in that context; and it would indicate that he has some definite source
before him.
My observations on the sources of Haribhadra’s legends, I am quite
aware, are tentative; and I hope that those scholars, who have better library
facilities at their disposal and who have a closer study of the Purāņas, would try
to shed more light on this topic.

is extracted from the Tattvakaumudī? which is a Vivaraņa or Vitti by Sangha-
tilaka on the Samyaktvasaptatikā, attributed to Haribhadra himself. The
prasasti of the Vrttigives a good bit of information about Sanghatilaka and his
predecessors in the ascetic line. It opens with the glorification of Candragaccha
to which belonged the following teachers: Vardhamāna, Jineśvara, Abhayadeva I
(rangan navángī-mahāvrtti-Stambhana-Pārsvanātha-jinarāt-mūrti-prakāśaikakrt
the author of the commentaries on the nine Angas, [ who became a Sūri in
Samvat 1088 or 1031 A. D. ])", Jinavallabha, Jinasekhara, Padmacandra, Vijaya-
candra, Abhayadeva II (from whom started the Rudrapallīya-gaccah) Deva-
bhadra, Prabhānanda, Srīcandra & Vimalacandra, Gunasekhara and lastly
Sanghatilaka, the author of Tattvakaumudi. Sanghatilaka had his vidyā-guru
in Jinaprabha whose erudition had pleased, Sāhi Mahammada at Dhilli?. He
composed the Vștti at the request of Devendra who was an anuja of Somatilaka,
an eminent pupil of Sanghatilaka himself. It was composed at Sārasvata-
pattana (Pāțaņa?) (and finished ] during Dipotsava (i. e., October-November)
in the year 1422 (srimad-Vikrama-vatsare dvi nayarâmbhodhi-kşapākrt prame)
of the Vikrama era, i. e., -57 = 1365 A. D.
This Sanskrit Dhūrtākhyāna is neither a Chāyā nor a literal and
studious metrical rendering or paraphrase of the Prākrit original, though it is
solely based on it. Sanghatilaka, there is not the least doubt, has the Prākrit
text of Haribhadra before him; he is trying to present its contents, in simple
Sanskrit verses, with sufficient closeness and strictly adhering to the same

hearing all this from Susthita, developed firm Samyaktva. He accepted the vows
of a householder. His wife also accepted ratna-traya-dharma. Even when his
wife was troubled by a Vyantari, Vaiśramaşa's faith in Jina was unshaken. In
due course he attained liberation. The concluding portion runs thus: ut que

sequence of narration; and he attempts to include most of the ideas from
the original, at times in identical expressions (Pk. I. 76, Sk. 66 etc.). He is
more after narrating the story with as few secondary details as possible.
Whenever there are lengthy descriptions in the Prākrit text, he either sum.
marises them or adds his own with a bit of independence. It may be that even
metrical exigencies have frustrated his attempts to be more close and literal in
his rendering. Sometimes he expresses the original with remarkable compact-
ness (verses 82, 103, etc.) and in a few cases with elegance and beauty
(125, etc.). He shows that he is fairly acquainted with the details of Purāņic
mythology: the proper names are freely substituted by other synonyms
(Svāmin = Skanda, Mahāsena =Şaņmukha, etc.); once an additional source,
Bhārata (102) is rightly added; and sometimes are added supplementary
details, such as, the names Dhūmorņā and Nahuşa (verses 351, 385) and
the birth of Kārtikeya for the destruction of Tārakāsura ( 204 f.). Sometimes
his references to the sources are not quite to the point (169) and in one place
(106) it is a bit obscure.
Perhaps a verse between Nos. 867 and 87 is missing. Possibly in his
zeal of summarising the story, Sanghatilaka skips over certain portions of
the Prakrit text, viz., I. 30-4, V. 115 f. The contents of some verses, for
instance, III. 83, V. 80, are not fully covered: the latter, it may be noted
presents some difficulties of interpretation. The legend of Varāha lifting
the earth (III. *10*) is missed by him, somewhere between verses 236-38.
As to the quotations in the original, it appears that the author wants to present
his text purely in Sanskrit: some of the Prākrit quotations (II. 50, III. 67)
are nicely rendered into Sanskrit (125, 215); some of those in Sanskrit are duly
reproduced; but it is difficult to say why some (II. 73, IV. 92, V. 4, 5, 103)
are skipped over without any trace.
More than once Sanghatilaka not only shows difference in ideas
but also adds new ideas, when compared with the Prākrit original (see for
instance: Nos. 210, 23d, 1596, 161d, 1990, 2045, 239d, 242d, 243d, 316ab, 409d,
416d, etc.). Some of these are apt similes, quite creditable to any poet.
There are many places where one can easily take exception to Sangha-
tilaka’s rendering of the original: lhasiya-celam (I. 60)=dūşita-vāsasam (52);
seam (I. 74)= sesam (64); Sea-kurdalī nāma' (1.75)= Sitakundali-nāmā (65);
namiūnc Jinavariñdaṁ (II. 24)=nrpatin natvā (99); phuttań du-bhāga-
jūyam (II. 29 ) = trividhatān agamat (104); etc. His statement that the
progeny of Gauri and Saṁkara was required for destroying Tāraka (203–4),
1 On comparing with the ed. of the commentary, I find an additional verse which
runs thus: het TFT2: 48STET 29764:1 FHSTETT FETTETTHESAfifaga l1 [<&*]ll.
2 The Gujarāti text reads S'vetakundalī nāmi.
3 In this particular case, as required by the context, Sanghatilaka appears to have
had before him a reading like namiūna naravarindan, because Jina is not at all
introduced in the earlier part of the story. The presiding deity is a Yakşa. The
Gujarāti text also says: rājānē pranandi,

though quite in agreement with a Purāņic tradition, is contradictory to the
explicit statement of Haribhadra (III, 55) who follows a slightly different
tradition.
On account of its being a part of the commentary, the opening and
concluding portions of the Sanskrit Dhūrtākhyāna do not give it an appearance of
a self-sufficient unit. More than once, it comes to our help in clearly under-
standing the Prākrit text of Haribhadra.
The Dhūrtākhyāna in Old-Gujarātī, included in this edition, mentions
at its close that it was written (lişitam) or copied by Pt. Lakşmīkīrti, the
pupil of Ratnasundaragani of the Jinamāņikya-śākhā of the Kharatara-gaccha
at Udaipura in Saṁvat 1758 (-57 = 1701 A. D.), Kārtika Sukla, 12, Saturday.
The word lişitam should ordinarily mean "copied'; so this proof is not enough
to infer that Lakşmikīrti is the author of this Gujarāti work. In fact, we do not
know the name of its author; and all that we can say about him is this much:
he flourished earlier than 1701 A. D.; he had realised that the Dhūrtākhyāna
was an effective attack against the Purāṇic religion and the Purāņas; and
he wrote the tales, from the Dhūrtākhyāna of Haribhadra, in the loka-bhūşd, that
they might be intelligible to laymen (bālāvabodha-rūpāḥ kathāh).
The author's primary aim is to narrate the stories included by
Haribhadra in bis Dhū. He closely follows the Prākrit text, and mainly
concentrates his attention on narrating the stories, ignoring the mosaic descrip-
tions of Haribhadra and spicy similes of Sanghatilaka. At times his rendering
is quite literal. To make the narration effective, he amplifies the original
by additional remarks (p. 49, 11. 19, 22-3; p. 60, 11, 5-6; p. 64, 11. 21-23; etc.),
Some verses in the Prākrit (III. 83, V, 80) are not duly covered, and some
details (V. 115f.) are disposed off summarily. Partly agreeing with Sangha-
tilaka, some quotations are not included (II, 73, IV. 92, V, 4, 5, 18, 103).
Somehow I. 87*1 is quoted with some different readings.
There is not the least doubt that the author is mainly following the
Prākrit text: his Gujarāti rendering, as a rule and throughout the work, agrees
more with Prākrit original than with the Sanskrit version of Sanghatilaka;
two quotations (II. 50, III. 67) which are rendered into Sanskrit by Sangha-
tilaka, are quoted in Prākrit, as in the original, by our author (pp. 54, 57); and
one legend, III. *10*, omitted by the Sk, text, is duly given by him (p. 58).
Though the Prākrit text is mainly and closely followed, there is sufficient proof
to indicate that he has consulted the Sanskrit text of Sanghatilaka, Many
points and remarks, which are not found in the Prākrit but are present in
1 See III. *6* above.
2 In continuation of what my friend Dr. A. M. Ghatage has said (Now Indian
Antiquary, I, 5, August 1938), I might record here that Sanghatilaka uses the
form mutkalāpya (334, 394), gerundive from the root mutkalāp, and it stands
once for ārcchiūņa, “having taken leave' (V, 9), and once for pucchiun, “having
taken permission' (V. 74) in the original Prākrit.

DHŪRTĀKHYANA :
the Sanskrit text, are seen in this Gujarati version. At I. 35 Haribhadra has
Bhārahe purāne a; Sanghatilaka has in the corresponding passage (29)
S'ri-Rāmāyana-Bhārate; and the Guja. text has Bhārata Rāmāyanādika grarithe
(p. 50, 1, 24). This is perhaps the only reference, in the first two chapters,
indicating explicitly the influence of the Sk. text. From the third chap,
pnwards we see more of this influence, and even some phrases here and there
remind us of the Sk, text: Pk. dhāüvvāya-pisñena (III, 1), Sk. dhātuvādadyair
vyasanaiḥ (150), Guj. dhātuvāclācika vyasanai (p. 55); Pk. no specific number,
Sk. stenāḥ pañca satimitāḥ (159), Guj. pāńca saï caura (p. 56 ); etc. Then in
describing the origin of Skanda (p. 57) to destroy Tārakāsura, the Gujarāti
version closely follows the Sk. text, so also in supplying the names of Dhūmorņā
Nahușa, etc. Thus the writer of the Guj. Dhūrtākhyāna has used Sangha-
tilaka's work here and there.
The author claims that these stories are being written in loka-bhāşa
which means the popular language (current, say roughly, in Northern Gujarāta,
sometime before 1701 A. D.) as distinguished from the literary languages like
Sanskrit, Prākrit and even Apabhramśa. The author, it is clear, is well-versed
in Pākrit and Sanskrit; and inevitably the large sprinkling of Sanskrit words,
seen in these stories, is due more to the author's command over Sk. vocabulary
than to the actual usage of the contemporary loka-bhāşă. This inference is quite
natural when we look at the percentage of pure Sanskrit words in any modern
Indian language as used by a Šāstrin, or even an educated man, and an
illiterate villager. Loan words are an unsafe evidence in understanding the
essential grammatic structure of any loka-bhāṣā, because they can be easily grafted
anywhere; and it is all the more true in the case of religious books whose topics
were usually described in Sanskrit terms. So the loka-bhāṣā, or Old-Gujarāti,
in which our author wrote could not have contained so many Sk, words; and we
should study its nature by taking into account declensional forms, verbal
formations, particles etc. An exhaustive study of the language cànnot be
attempted here; but I would simply note a few formations which are interesting
to a student of Apabhraíśa and post-Apabhraṁsa stages especially in Rājasthāna
and Gujarāta. Nominal forms: joyana, thāma'a place', tarasi 'thirst', pāyaka
sa foot-soldier', be striu, bhojāto (Pk. bhāüjjāyā), māchini 'a fisher woman',
rātā phala 'red fruits'. Pronominal fornis: tum, mujha, hur (also huñe) etc.
Particles: jima, pince 'also, but', v.l. pani (p. 50, l. 11, foot-note 13), ma, hethai,
hethi, v. l., hethuń. Verbal forms: upanā, kahau, chaï, jour, jovaï, dājhato,
païţhum, païsām, paranī, pararṣai, biha, bhāgo, mão, mokalajyo, lāgo, sakai;
hunto, etc.
1 Compare Sanskrit verses 231, 236, 262 with the corresponding Gujarāti portions.
2 It is interesting to compare these forms with those recorded in the Index of A Study
of the Gujarāti Language by T. N. Dave, London 1935. The prose commentary
in Old Gujarāti (on the Upadeśamāla) on which Dr. Dave's study is based is called
Bālāvabodha; and it may be noted that the Gujarati version of the Dhū. also bears
the same name.

A CRITICAL STUDY
NEGO
The above illustrations are picked up at random, and there is no
pretension to an exhaustive study. Apart from the large number of Sanskrit
loan words, this loka-bhāşā shows many words used in Prākrits; and some of the
particles are the same as those in Apabhramśa. The pronouns and verbal
formations of the Apabh, stage have undergone a great deal of change
which is natural and unavoidable in the evolution of spoken languages. Some
changes are just a matter. of shifting pronunciation: kahaü>kahau, dajjhanto
>dājhato, mokkalijjaii>mokalajyo, sakkaï> sakai, etc. Rājasthānī and Gujarāti
are more lucky than any other modern Indian language because of their rich
heritage of earlier stages of the language; and a careful study of the texts,
from century to century, would certainly demonstrate the evolution of these
languages through Prākrit, Apabhramsa and post-Apabh, stages of the Middle
Indo-Aryan.
The Sanskrit and Gujarāti Dhūrtākhyānas cannot be judged as original
contributions like their Prākrit counterpart; they definitely indicate, however,
that the performance of Haribhadra did appeal to subsequent generations; and,
as they stand today, they are useful aids to understand and check the Prākrit
text of Haribhadra.
6. Dhūrtākhyāna and Dharma-parīkņā
We come across a pretty large number works called Dharma-parīkņā
(Dp:)? Most of them are not critically examined as yet. It is Amitagati's Dp.
that has been exhaustively studied, and it can be accepted as a representative of
Dp. texts for all practical purposes. Vittavilāsa, Padmasāgara and others have
mechanically followed Amitagati's Dp. By the discovery of Harişeņa's Dp.
(Saṁvat 1044,-56 = A. D. 988), which was written 26 years earlier than that of
-Amitagati (Saṁvat 1070, -56= A. D. 1014), it is clear now that Amitagati is not
the creator of the plot of Dp. Amitagati tells us that he composed his work in
two monthsø: no doubt, he is a gifted didactic poet with a flowing Sanskrit
style; but he does not mention his predecessors. Harişeņa, however, frankly says
that the Dp. which was formerly composed by Jayarāma in Gathā metre is now
composed by him in Paddhadiyā metre. Unfortunately Jayarāma's Dp. has
pot come to light so far. Harişeņa's Dp. is in Apabhramśa; there is no
conclusive evidence to establish that Anitagati solely followed Harişeņa;
the plot of the story, adopted by both Harişeņa and Amitagati, is remarkably
identical; what Harişeņa says would indicate that almost all his material
was present in Jayarāma's Dp.; and Amitagati's Sanskrit expression betrays
Prākritisms in narrative portions. All these facts go to indicate that Jayarāma's

Bombay 1901; another edition giving the Marāthi translation of Pt. Bahubali Sharma
has appeared lately, Sangli 1931. One feels the necessity of a critical edition of
Amitagati's text. ·

DHĒRTĀKHYĀNA:
work was in Gathā metre, the language being Sauraseni or Mābārāştri;
and for the present we might presume that the plot of Dp. owes its birth
to Jayarāma.
Comparing the works of Harişeņa and Amitagati one finds that,
so far as the the events of the plot and their sequence are concerned,
both of them are in close agreement. This indicates that Amitagati has not
taken much liberty with the structure of the plot. Harişeņa's text is not
available in print; so I give below the analysis of the narrative structure of
Amitagati's Dp. which would enable us to compare and contrast the two works,
Dhū. and Dp. .
In Jambūdvīpa, on the southern range of Vijayārdha, in the town
named Vaijayanti, there lived a Vidyādhara king Jitaśatru and his queen
Vāguvegā who had a son Manovega, endowed with faith in Jina's doctrines,
His friend Pavanavega, prince of Priyāpurī, had no such faith; and he was
much worried on that account. Once returning from his visit to Jina-temples,
his vimūnd stopped at Ujjainī, in Mālava; and in its northern park there
was an omniscient monk, Jinamati, on whom he waited with reverence.
Jinamati expounded to the audience the proportion of pleasure and pain
in sarsāra with the explanation of madhu-bindu-drstānta and the consequences
of religious and irreligious life. Manovega asked Jinamati whether his friend
Pavanavega would possess samyaktva; and he got a reply that he could
enlighten his friend by taking him to Pāļaliputra. Pavanavega was anxious
to meet his friend Manovega whom he met on the way to the joy of both.
Manovega told him how he visited various Jaina holy places and came
to Pāțaliputra, a prosperous centre of Brahmanic ritual and learning. Pavana-
vega expresses his impatience to visit Pāțaliputra, and next morning both of
them reached there and got down in the park.
I. Both of them, though decked with ornaments, assumed the form of
faggot-grass-sellers. It was a surprising sight to one and all who began
to speculate about them. They reached the Brahma-śālā, bet the drum,
and sat on the golden seat. At this challenge, Brāhmaṇas rushed forth
for dispute. They wondered at their splendour and grace, and almost mistook
them for gods. On being pointedly questioned, Manovega, requesting them not
to be irritated, told them that all that they did was out of mere curiosity
and that they were mere grass-selling boys whose prototypes were found
in Bhārata stories. One Brāhmaṇa asked: "How can there be grass-faggot-
sellers decorated with jewels? If such cases are found in the Rāmāyaṇa
1 Mironow follows the rule 'divide et impera' and presents the summaries of various
stories separately. The method is admirable and quite suited for studying the stories,
But the analysis of disjoined stories does not clearly bring out the effect of entire
work, especially of the fantastic tales and the bearing of subsequent legends on their
points. Just to bring out this aspect of Dp. clearly, I have added here a bit detailed
summary. Those who want more particulars about individual stories may either
consult the original Sk, text or Mironow's dissertation,

and Bhārata, we would like to hear them.' Manovega said that he would
explain everything, if there are any thoughtful (vicāraka) among them ;
otherwise his fate would be like that of Madhukara who received 16 strokes for
telling the truth about the heaps of pepper and grains in different parts
of the country. The leader assured him that they were all thoughtful Brāl-
maņas. Further Manovega told them that he feared to speak, if any of them
belonged to the following ten types of men (about whom ten stories are
narrated): 1) rakta, a passionate husband duped by his younger wife; 2) dvişta,
who wants his son to take revenge on his enemy by using his dead body;
3) müdha, a silly priest outwitted by his unchaste wife and pupil ; 4) vyudgrāhin,
a blind block-head prince; 5) pitta-dūsita, a bilious fellow mistaking sweet as
sour; 6) cūta, a wreckless king who pulled out the mango tree; 7) kşīra, a foolish
Tomara chief who illtreated a milch cow; 8) aguru, an ignoramus who could not
understand the value of aguru plantation; 9) cancando, a washerman incapable
of recognising sandal; and 10) bälisa: Four fools, once upon a time, saluted
a Jaina saint, endowed with various religious and ascetic virtues, who uttered
the blessing dharma-vrddhi'. They began to quarrel as to whom it was meant
for; and when they asked the monk, he told them that it was meant for him
who was decided to be the most foolish by the wise people of the town
after hearing their biographies. 10a) Vişamekşaņa narrated thus: One day
I was sleeping with my two wives on both sides. Just for joke, I placed
the lamp on my forehead. A mischerous rat pulled the burning wick, and one
of my eyes was scorched. Afraid of disturbing my wives, I allowed my eye
to be burnt.' 106) Kunțahamsagati spoke thus: 'Řkşī and Kharī are my most
ugly wives; their mutual jealous abuse and quarrel made me lose both my legs;
and being afraid of them, I tolerated all this. 10c) Boța (or Boda) said thus:
"I had been to my father-in-law. At night, I had a bet with my wife
that one who speaks first should give a rich feast. A thief entered the house
and collected all the treasure. He began stripping my wife of her clothes
on the body. I kept quiet. She began to abuse me at the loss of wealth and
at her insult. I at once told her that she lost the game by speaking first, and
she should give the feast now.' 100) Gallasphoţika told his tale thus: 'I had
gone to the house of my father-in-law. Out of bashfulness and seeing some
hedious sight, I did not take my meals. As time passed, I was overpowered
by hunger. I was just gulping a handful of fine rice kept in a basket
below the cot when my wife came there, and I could not swallow them.
My mouth was full to the brim; I could not speak; and my cheeks grew hard.
There was a great row, and different explanations were offered about my disease.
A skilful physician diagnosed my trouble, calling it tandulīya ailment;
he quietly bored my cheeks and took out rice particles. Thus I made myself
an object of ridicule. After hearing these tales, the Brāhmaṇas assured
Manovega that none from them belonged to any of the ten types and that he
should answer their question, Manovega spoke thus: Vişņu is a mighty
divinity, full of glory, grace and power; then how is it that he stayed
of my own." 100) Kuntabalous abuse and qua 10c) Bota (o Bonith my wife

DHÜRTĀKHĀYNA:
as a cowherd-boy at Gokula sporting in various ways, that he became a messen-
ger of Pāņdavas and a charioteer of Arjuna, that he begged at Bali’s door,
and that he suffered from Sītā’s separation? If that divine Vişņu could
do mean acts, what is wrong in our selling grass and faggots? The Brāhmaṇas
felt disillusioned; and they could see how god Vişņu was exposed to so many
blemishes and inconsistencies, and how Purāņas were full of contradictions.
II. Second time Manovega became a rough hunter, and his friend,
a cat without ears, put in a pot. They met Brāhmaṇas as before, and told them
how the cat had the power of warding off rats at miles' distance and that it was
for sale. Brāhmaṇas realized its utility and were ready to buy it at the
quoted price. On examination, however, it was found that it was devoid of
ears which, Manovega explained, were eaten by ferocious rats one nighte
Brāhmaṇas laughed at his daring contradiction. Manovega refused to admit
that the single flaw of not having ears spoiled all other virtues of the cat.
The Brāhmaṇas assured him that they were not Frogs in the Well';
but they questioned him straight: 'How can this flaw of the cat be tolerated ?
Manovega then narrated the legend of passionate Agni (or of Yama
and Chāyā): The ascetic Mandapakausika feared that he might lose heaven
for want of progeny, so he married a widow from whom he had a beautiful
daughter Chāyā by name. While going on piligrimage, he just thought
to what god he should entrust his daughter who would not be able to stand
the strain of journey. He began scrutinizing the acts and character of different
gods: īśvara is extremely passionate; Hari is not satisfied with 16 thousand
Gopīs; Brahman was mad after Tilottamā and lost his head, and once
he generated Jāmbava from a bear; and Indra misbehaved with Abalyā.
All these gods are victims of cupid. So he kept Chāyā with Yama who too,
as days passed, fell in love with her and always carried her in his stomach.
Agni was jealous of Yama's prize. One day when Yama had taken her out on
the bank of Ganges, Agni mated with her. Just at that moment Yama came
there. She swallowed Agni, and Yama swallowed her. Agni was missing
to the distress of all. At last Vāyu managed to expose both Chāyā and Agni.
Agni tried to conceal himself when pursued by Yama. If Agni can still be
a god with all this blemish, my cat's yirtues can remain intact without ears.'
Brāhmaṇas admitted that Purāņas were inconsistent. Manovega further
pointed out the blemishes of Samkara, Vişņu, Brahman, Indra, Yama, Agni,
Sun, etc.
III. Third time Manovega assumed the form of a nude Jaina monk;
and accompained by Pavanavega, he met Brāhmaṇas as before. They assured
him that they were not like that king of Campā who illtreated his truth-speaking
minister, and requested him to narrate how he became a monk etc. Manovega
spoke thus : ‘My father is Munidatta, a Śrāvaka from Śrīpura ; and he entrusted me
to an ascetic for study. Once I was sent out with the Kamandalu to bring water,
but I sat playing with it on the road. Having learnt from other pupils that the
teacher was angry, I ran towards the town. On the way a mountain-like elephant

Page 79****************************************************************************************
A CRITICAL STUDY
rushed against me. Helpless and terrified I entered into the Kamandalu which
was placed on the branch of bhinda; the elephant also rushed into it, and began
tearing my clothes with its trunk, I ran out through the spout; the elephant
also followed me; but with its tail stuck there, it fell on the ground. I reached a
Jaina temple, and not getting ctothes I accepted this traditional form of a Jaina
monk. The Brāhmaṇas laughed at him as a fantastic lier telling impossibilities.
When they assured him to abandon such scriptures as contained these details,
he narrated to them the following episodes: Arjuna brought the Nāgaloka
through an arrow-hole; Agastya drank the whole ocean, and his Kamandalu
containing the universe was put on the branch of an atasi plant; and Brahman's
hair was caught at Vişnu's navel when the former came out of latter's stomach
after seeing there the universe which was once missing. If these legends are
true, it is quite possible that the elephant could pass through the Kamandalu-
hole, be accommodated in the Kamaņdalu, and have it's tail stuck in the spout.
The Brāhmaṇas were thus silenced; and they were further instructed by him on
the faults of divinities and on the true nature of God.
IV. Fourth time Manovega became a Tāpasa, and accompanied by his
friend, met the Brāhmaṇas as before. On condition that they are quite
considerate, he narrated his tale thus : 'At the time of my mother's marriage
there was a confusion created by an elephant. She rushed out with the bride-
groom at whose touch she fell in a swoon, but he ran away. It was discovered
that she was pregnant due to his touch. Hearing of a 12 years' famine from
Tāpasas, I remained in the womb all the while and came out when the famine
was over. As soon as I was born, I took a pot and demanded food. It was
considered ominous; and I had to leave home and become a Tāpasa like this.
My mother was righlty married again, as though she tried to follow Draupadi's
example. I came here on my religious tour.' The Brāhmaṇas said that he
was a first-rate lier talking impossible things; they admitted that they were open
to correction, if such details were found in their Scriptures. Manovega, to
confirm his experience, narrated the following legends: Bhagiratha was conceived
at women's mutual contact; Gandhārī became pregnant by embracing a jack-
fruit tree; Abhimanyu understood cakra-vyūha while he was in the womb;
Mandodarī conceived at the contact of her father's semen, had her foetus
restrained in the womb for seven thousand years, and delivered Indrajit after
being married to Rāvana; Vyāsa accepted renunciation immediately after his
birth, and his mother remained still a virgin; Kuntī remained a kanyā even after
begetting a son from the Sun; and Candramatī was still a kanyà after Nāgaketu's
birth and was married to Uddālaka. If these Purāņic legends are true, there is
nothing incredible in my mother conceiving me at her beloved's touch, in my
hearing about the famine from the womb, in my remaining there for twelve
years, in my becoming an ascetic soon after my birth, and in my mother
becoming again a kanyā after delivering me.' Manovega further enlightened
Pavanavega and all others there by narrating the true tales about Karņa, Vyāsa
Pāņdavas, etc. He illustrated to them how people mechanically and thoughtlessly
follow others, as in that story of the Copper Pot.
TEREST

DÜŪRTAKHYĀNA
V. Fifth time Manovega, along with Pavanavega, became a Buddhist
monk (rakta-pata); and on being assured by Brāhmaṇas that they were
thoughtful, he narrated his wonderful experience: "We are devotees of Buddhist
monks. Once with sticks in our hands we were appointed by them to guard
their clothes spread in sun shine. Two terrific jackals came there, and we
mounted the Stūpa with fear; they, however, lifted it up, and flew away
speedily. When they dropped us with a view to devour us, there arrived
Bhillas with dogs, and the jackals ran away. As we were in an unknown
country, we easily became Buddhist monks.' Brāhmaṇas wondered at his
astonishing lies; but he reminded them of the following legend: According to the
Rāmāyaṇa, each monkey lifted five mountains. If this is true, two jackals can
easily lift a Stūpa.
VI. At last Manovega and Pavanavega became Svetāmbara monks
( sveta-bhikṣu) and met the Brāhmaṇas who asked them why they became monks
and who was their guru. Manovega continued in reply: Once our father
Aruņaśrika sent us into the forest to graze the sheep, because the shepherd had
to attend his father who was down with fever. I requested my companion to
tend the sheep, so that in the meanwhile I might eat some kapittha fruits. The
desire for fruits was very strong, but the tree was too tall. I went near, cut my
head, and threw it on the tree requesting it to eat the fruits; as it ate fruits on
the tree, my stomach was getting full below; and when I was satisfied, the head
came down and joined the body as before. I looked for my brother, but found
him asleep and all the sheep lost. We feared that our father would beat us; 80
we went away to a distant territory and accepted this comfortable garb.'
Manovega further confirmed to the Brāhmaṇas the truth of his experience by
narrating the following legends: Cutting his nine heads Rāvaņa offered them
to Sambhū, and these were again joined to his body ; Dadhimukha's head could
get itself joined with another's trunk; parts of Angada’s body were joined by
Hanumat; Jarāsaņdha's body was constituted of different parts; Skanda's
person was made up of six portions; and when the priests are fed, the ancestors
are satisfied. If all this, narrated in Brahmanic scriptures, is true, there is
nothing improbable in my own head joining the body, and in my stomach being
filled when my mouth eats kapittha fruits.'
The Brāhmaṇas were discomfited, and had no replies to give.
Manovega explained to Pavanavega various other flaws in the religion and
scriptures of Brāhmaṇas; he expounded to him how the heretical creeds
originated; and he also propounded Jaina principles and practices at length.
Pavanavega came to possess samyaktva and duly accepted the vows of a Srāvaka.
Both Manovega and Pavanavega led a happy life of religious householders.
The Purāņa-like beginning, the religio-didactic discourse in the form of
madhu-bindu-drstānta, the abnormal proportion of folk-tales introduced by way
of illustration, the different names of characters, immediate purpose of converting
Pavanavega to Jainism by his pious friend Manovega, constant repetition
of moral teachings and religious prescriptions, casual and side attacks on gods

A ORITICAL STUDY

and holy men, and above all the general frame-work of the story make Dp. much
different from Dhū. But if we go a bit deeper and study Dp. more analytically
and scrutinisingly, the inner kernel of Dp., though heavily superimposed with
good many accessories and details, remarkably corresponds with that of Dhū.
The mode of presentation is somewhat different, but the purpose is the same.
Dhū, is a satiric attack on the Purāṇic legends referring to deities and holy
personalities; and Dp., as indicated even by its name, is out to scrutinize
the credentials of other religions by criticising their deities and mythology,
of course for a specified and immediate aim of converting Pavanåvega.
Haribhadra's concluding suggestion (V. 122) that the study of Dhū. leads
to darsana-suddhi has been fully developed latert: Dp, actually converts
Pavanavega who comes to possess samyaktva; and the narration of the Dhū.-
story, according to Sanghatilaka, makes Vaiśramaņa-śreşthin a pious believer
(S2-srāddha) with firm faith in Jina. What is implicit, artistic and detached in
the Dhūrtākhyāna becomes outspoken, religio-didactic and propagandistic in
the Dharmaparīkņā. In Dhū. the five Dhūrtas narrate tales of fantastic
personal experience, and some points from them are confirmed to be reliable
by other Dhūrtas after quoting parallel legends from Purāņas. In Dp. Manovega
himself, being a Vidyādhara, assumes six different forms; and then he either
presents an inconsistent situation or narrates an improbable tale of personal
experience. When his inconsistencies are exposed by the learned gathering of
Brābmaņas, he silences them by quoting similar episodes from their. Purāņas.
Besides this fundamental similitude between Dhū, and Dp., there are closely
corresponding motifs in the fantastic autobiographical tales; and some of
the confirmatory legends are common. Müladeva and the Jaina monk tell
nearly the same episode of Kamandalu and Elephant". Immediatly after their
birth, Khandapānās son walked away taking leave of his mother; and Tāpasa
demanded food and accepted renunciation. Saśa lifted up the elephant-hide-bag
full of oil; and the two jackals, in the Buddhist monk's tale, lift up a Stūpa.
Elāşādha's head, cut off by the thieves, eats badara fruits on the tree;
and the Svetāmbara monk throws his head on the tree in order to eat kapitthal
fruits. Legends like Brahman's lotus or hair sticking at Vişnu's navel,
Vyāsa's birth, Monkeys lifting mountains, and the physical make up of
Jarāsamdha and Şaņmukha are quoted in both Dhū. and Dp. to confirm almost
common motifs. Though not in identical contexts there are many details and
legends common to both Dhū. and Dp.: loose morals of gods (Dhū. I. 60 f.;
Dp. XI. 21 f.); Brahman and Tilottamā (Dhū. I. 58-84; Dp. XI. 29 f.);

1 Though the Dhū, does not mention any such event, the Prabhāvakacarita of Prabhā
Bandra (A. D. 1277) records that Haribhadra diverted that layman Kārpāsika from
partiality for the Bhārata and Itihāsas by telling him the five stories of rogues
(kitava-kathānaka-pañcaka), and won him over to the Jaina faith (verses IX.
207-12). Prabhācandra quotes v. 120 thus : gÝ TE Teho T T a Te I siat
fua JATFJEHRI Hoaill; and to explain this verse Haribhadra is said to have
composed the Dhūrtākhyāna,

Indra and Abalyā (Dhū. V. 33–36; Dp. XI. 61 f.); Agni's mating with Yama's
beloved" (Dhū. V. 26-30; Dp. XI. especially 82 f.); Agastya drinking the ocean
(Dhū. IV. 27; Dp. XIII. 18 f.); Kunti's sons from Sūrya etc. (Dhū. I. 82 f.,
V. 11, 23, 37; Dp. XIV. 91, XV. 11); the male organ of Siva (Dhū. I. 39-4,
V. 59; Dp. XIII. 80); etc.
The hungry Dhūrtas narrating their experiences and confirming the same
with Purāņic legends during a rainy week, with their dinner depending on the
decision of their discussion, present a back-ground (in Dhū.) which is much
dissimilar to that depicted in Dp. in which a learned gathering of Brāhmaṇas of
Pāțaliputra is visited on six successive days by Manovega (with his friend
Pavanavega) who, modestly avoiding debate with Brāhmaṇas even after he
beats the drum and sits on the golden seat, narrates fantastic tales and himself
confirms the same with Parāṇic legends, when challenged about the veracity of
his statements. In Dhū. it is the autobiographical experience that forms the
back-bone of the story, the points of which are confirmed by Purāņic legends;
and so it is in the last four stories, i. e., III-VI, of the Dharma-parīkņā. The
first two contexts in Dp., i. e., I and II, present not an inconsistent and
improbable story, but an incredible situation presented to the eye: those who
have ornaments on their body cannot be grass-faggot-sellers, and a cat which is
claimed to scare away rats at miles' distance by its presence cannot have its ears
eaten by rats. The first situation is justified by the example of Vişņu; and the
second by saying that a single flaw of the cat can be tolerated or ignored as in
the case of god Agni. The Dhū. has no Brahmanic audience explicitly
before it, while in Dp. Manovega is actually made to encounter the Brāhmaṇas
in their own citadel and to outwit them by openly pointing out and criticising
inconsistent elements in the Purāņic mythology. The episode of the Buddhist
monk in Dp. (No. V) is not quite successful, because it affords opportunity
to satirize only one legend from the Rāmāyaṇa.
(Jayarāma's Dp. is not available to us, and Harişeņa's Dp. is still
in Mss. If we are to be guided by Amitagati's work, we find that he attacks
vehemently the Purānic deities, even when they do not figure in the legends
satirised; here and there he adds certain Parāņic stories, as they ought to be and
as they are accepted by Jaina tradition.; now and then he offers pithy maxims of
worldly wisdom and sections of didactic teaching; he loses no opportunity to
denounce worldly pleasures and prescribe religious discourses; and he not only
criticises Purāņic religion but adds also substantial details on Jaina mythology,
dogmatics and ethics. These are some of the specialities of the Dp. text as its
came to be shaped by Amitagati.
1
The legend in Dhū. is shorter; and we do not find there the name of Chāyā and her
association with Mandapakaušika, given in Dp.
The town of Ujjainſ with its northern park is introduced in both Dhū. (I. 2-3) and
Dp. (I, 58, 64), though in different contexts.

A CRITICAL STUDY

The points of similarity, already noted above, do indicate that
Jayarāma must have used the Dhūrtākhyāna of Haribhadra or some subsequent
recension of it. The agreement is of a fundamental character and cannot be
brushed aside as accidental or incidental. The illustrative sub-stories and the tales
of four fools, included in Dp., show that some other popular stories have been
intelligently used. Haribhadra by his satirical genius of a very high order merely
smashed the structure of Purāṇic mythology, but the authors of Dp. have gone
a few steps ahead that they tried to erect instead a superstructure of Jaina
religious preaching. The artistic mould of Dhū. is missed; but a form of
effective propaganda has been evolved, and it became much popular in subsequent
centuries as indicated by the number of Dp. texts in different languages".
It is quite natural that Amitagati, or even his predecessors, utilised different
and additional Purāņic legends for the same purpose. The Dp. texts are
stamped with a definite religious bias: perhaps that prohibited them from
admitting a character like Khandapānā, and on that account some of the
fantastic tales are toned down, in some cases being followed by a few Purāņic
legends. It is interesting to note that sometimes Amitagati, though he is
a full-fledged propagandist, writes in a half-serious, mocking mood, even when he
introduces a Digambara monk (Dp. XII, 88 f.). That is a befitting tone for
a satirical writer. The Dhūrtākhyāna of Haribhadra, we have seen, is a unique
satire; and its successors like the Dharma-parīkņā are a fine specimen of Indian
literature which is both interesting and instructive. The caustic prick, which
such works might have given to the zealous followers of Purāņic religion, has
not much effect on the dispassionate student of Indian literature: for him
every novel aspect adds to the wealth of the great literary heritage of the past.
7 Prākrit Dialect and Style of Dhūrtākhyāna
The Prākrit text of Dhūrtākhyāna, presented in this edition, is based
only on two MSS.; and still one is faced with difficulties, here and there, in
construing and interpreting it satisfactorily. It is, therefore, far from being
final; and any attempt to prepare an exhaustive grammar of it is out of question
at present. It is intended here just to note a few salient features of the Prākrit
dialect of Dhū., as it stands in this edition.
It has been a recognised convention with the editors of Ardhamāgadhī
and Jaina Mābārāştri texts to use almost uniformly initial n and non-initial n;
1 My friend Prof. D. L. Narasimhachar, Mysore, draws my attention to one more Dp.
(in addition to those which I have mentioned in my paper on Harişena's Dp.)
in Kannada by Candrasāgara Varņi. He has seen 2 ms., and has kindly sent some
extracts to me. We learn the following details from them: The Dp. of. Vittavilāsa,
the pupil of Rāvala Yatīśvara, could be understood only by the learned; so the
Śrāvakas of Belugula requested Cárukīrti Paņditācārya to get propered a rendering
of it in modern Kannada (Kannada-vyākhyānadalli mādisi kodienibadāgi). This
then, at the instance of Cârukīrti, came to be composed by Candrasāgara who offers
salutation to both Cārukīrti and [Lakşmisena ] Svāmi of Kolhapur. It is written in
simple Kannada, mostly in prose. Following Vrtta vilāsa's Dp. it has ten chapters.
It is said to be written in Saka 1770 (+78-1848 A, D.), Ānanda Samvatsara,

DHĒRTĀKAYĀNA:
Hemacandra's rule (VIII. i. 228-9) is optional; and Dhū. shows definite
partiality for n, whether initial or non-initial. Perhaps following the ms. B,
which conforms to the more strict rule of Hemacandra, ý-sruti is not introduced
after vowels other than a or ā; but the text shows many exceptional cases, for
instance: kundija I. 58, dažja III. 48, cluggaïýā V. 92, dhariyā I. 91; mujaha
IV. 71, suyan II. 51, hanujāi III, 44. It appears that ms. A represents
a more correct situation, namely, to put y-śruti along with the udvrtta vowel,
a or ā, irrespective of the preceding vowel; and Jacobi also uniformly follows
this rule in his ed. of the Samarāiccakahā of Haribhadra.
In the absence of separate Nāgarī orthographical symbols for ě and 8,
as distinguished from those for e and 0, we find that i and 2 are easily substituted
for ě and ở before conjuncts etc., where e and o are to be pronounced short*.
The point at issue is complicated by the fact that beside the writing of i and 26
for ě and o, we must also admit, in some cases, the change of these short vowels
to į and 2. General principles like the weakening at the end, the original
Sanskrit formation, and analogy would establish some system and decide a few
points. Sometimes this gives quite a deceptive appearance to certain nominal
and verbal forms etc.: ekataḥ eva >ěkkatto ccia>ikkattu (also ekatto =ěkkatto ?)
ccia IV. 73; ettio >ittio I. 38; kundiāě I. 40 but givāi I. 84 and Nilai V. 11;
Kumtie and Kurtii V. 11, 37; gotra >götta>gutta V. 39; cakraħ iva >cakko
vva>cakku vva IV. 5; kşetra > chétta >chitta IV. 1-2; yogya>jögga>jugga
V. 78; donni > durni I. 81; pēccham>picchan II. 5, 9; potta>putta II. 44;
běřti>bimti I. 11; samūho tti > samühu tti III. 57; śreșthi>sētthi>sitthi V.94;
sở cciya>su cciya I. 94, V. 113; hojja>hujja I. 59, 88; etc.
Now and then we come across certain forms which show a change in
the quantity of vowel : vī of the Present 3rd p. sing. III. 97, IV. 6 (cf. Samarā.
p. 249, 1. 18; p. 276, 1. 6); uchi IV. 30; jia IV, 35; māria IV. 47; laya I. 3;
mmi of the Loc. sing. I. 4, 23, 36, 51, II. 34, IV. 37, 88, V. 14, 78, 112
(usually at the close of a pāda; cf. Samarā. p. 80, 1. 12; p. 652, last line);
vi V. 17, 32 (also Paüma., 17. 12); sua III. 54; etc. All these are due
to exegencies of metre rather than being special grammatical forms. In this
category may be included aranī for aranyos II. 31, tesi for tesir I. 6, kadū for
kaddú IV. 35, etc.; also bandhassā for bandhassa in Samarā., p. 652, 1. 17.
There are many forms which show that a short vowel followed
by an anusvāra and the corresponding long vowel get mutually exchanged;
in some cases the text itself preserves both the forms: chammāsa (metrically
cakku vva
IV: 5: vecchain > piccham 17: Seethi sčithi > sithi
1 It has to be noted that Hemacandra himself knew cases which went against his rule;
and it is probable that he is following some grammatical tradition, while the practice
even in his own days vas to write it in all places irrespective of the preceding vowel.

required) I. 52, chanmāsan I. 32, chammisa I. 28, 89; dharań, dhārā I. 28–9;
mukkhatthā IV. 37 (also Paümacariya kūranatthā 5. 87); vahatthā IV. 27,80;
sakka III. 20; Stā for Siam II. 67 (Paüma. jattā kāūna 5. 86); nivvui for
nivvuin V. 51 (see Paüma. uppatti 1. 38, nivvui 5. 124, rai 6. 240); vilavamant
V. 100; sitthi for sitthim V. 99; bhariū III. 20. The Abl. sing. of mas, and
neu. in -am, noted by Alsdorf in the Vasudevahiņdī, appears to me a similar
case in which -am and -c are being interchanged. The Paümacariya gives plenty
of such cases: I have noted only a few. This exchange has not resulted from
any defective writing. Both of them have the same metrical value and
phonetic quantity, and they mutually alternate as a purely phonetic variant.
This interchange is not sporadic just affecting a few forms of our text.
It appears to have been a regular phenomenon which has left its influence on the
different aspects of Middle Indo-Aryan? Once we accept it, many strange
words and forms (besides those noted above) get easily explained, for instance,
sairakkhand & särakkhand, simha & siha, maṁsa & māsa; in Pāli vāgisa &
vargisa, sanātana & sanamtand ; etc. Probably this has arisen out of uncertain
pronunciation of a short vowel followed by an anusvāra.
Intervocalic g is not only retained sometime: jage IV. 43; näge IV.
46; sägara III. 75, also sūyara IV, 27, but k also is softened to g: egāgina
IV. 31; kamalāgarco V. 53; etc. Intervocalic d is retained in some cases : udara
III. 85; udahi IV. 89; tillodā IV. 21, also tilloa IV.7.
Instances like ten'ayagarena V. 67, divas'avasäne IV. 9, Bhārah'avek
yārce-kāle I. 82 illustrate Jacobi's rules of dropping of the final a of the first
word when followed by a even when in turn followed by a short syllable. As
typical Sandhis we might note asti + eşa= atthesa IV. 14, tuisnātā >uunhāyā>
unhāyā V. 8.
Some of the proper names show some phonetic changes : Agastya = Agcom
tthi I. 63, IV. 27, the Sanskrit verse regularly reads Agastin 265; Ahalyā=
Ahillā. V. 33, Mārkandeya = Makkanda II. 31, Pārāsura I. 63, V. 13
(note the v. l.), Rāmanat II. 62, 68, 71 and rarely Rävana III. 93, Vasistha =
Visittha I. 63.
Some words change their bases: kamamdala I. 32-3, beside kamare
datro I. 21-3; Bambhāna V. 116 (also Paüma. 5. 122 ); marrasă I. 50; Khar-
davānai for Khandavcīņcē IV. 14. – A few words stand without the

IV. 61, -saħbhama IV. 81, hiāhia IV. 85 (for similar cases see Paüma.
1. 6, 36 etc.). - The form Agatthinaṁ is Inst. sing.; such forms are
already noted by Pischel ($ 379) in Ardhamāgadbi; and plenty of them
are found in the Paümacariya 12. 113, 13. 10, 15. 20, 16. 32 etc. A form
like Agatthina would be quite regular in Apabhraṁśa. Uvvasiya? V. 115
is Gen. sing. (for such forms cf. Tiloyapaņņatti 1. 241; 2. 208, etc.,
also 4. 42, the termination for Gen. and Loc. being the same). Loc. sing.
kucchimmi II. 41, also kucchie II. 38. - Inst. sing. of asmad is me III. 3,
V. 21, 32; perhaps me is represented by mi at V. 32, second line. Looking
at the use of mi at II, 2 and IV. 2, 4, one finds that it is serving the purpose of
both aham (through Inst. sing. me, with p. p. p. as the predicate) and asmi
(through the forms amhi, mhi, ammi, mmi). Hemacandra is quite aware
of such forms; and Pischel has square-bracketed them in the absence of
authentic usage. Lately Alsdorfa has noted such cases from the Vasudevahindi;
and it will be seen that the forms of asmad have affected analogically those of
yuşmad. - At IV. 24 tan stands for tvam. Instr. sing. is te I. 87, also tume.
Of the verbal forms we may note a few. Present 1st p. sing. :
paribhamami IV. 3, V. 51, also paribhamāmi III. 1; 3rd p. sing. : tappaë
I. 55, 59, perhaps from the passive base (also Paüma. 9. 55). --- Imp. 2nd p.
sing de V. 78; in the light of the available material, its stages of evolution can
be shown thus: dehi dehi>de-dehi, naturally then de can stand for dehi. Our
text gives a form ehehi II, 36 (v.l. che chi, perhaps a scribal improvement on
eehi); and the Paümacariya gives some such forms: hanc hance 69. 112, ehehi
44.53, e-chi 8. 174, thā-thāhi 45. 108. The form sunijjasu I. 53 (cf. Paüma.
38. 46 khanejjäses) started perhaps with the passive augment but here
in the active sense*. -- The lengthening of i in bharīhāno V. 3 has parallels in
the Paümacariya : vaccīhāno V. 190, bhavīhāmi 118. 63, etc. -- ahesi IV: 33
is to be traced back to Aorist *abhavisīt (Pischel 516 and Hema. VIII iii. 164),
- pecchań II. 5, 9, is apparently used in the sense of the Present 1st p. sing,
- At III. 15 chinna is used as the base.".
-un or tum is the well-known termination of the Infinitive; but many
forms in this text are used with the Gerundive sense : oyariur IV. 2, kāuń IV.
50, gañtum I. 66, III. 40, 43, chinnium III. 15, namium II. 9, sämattheum III.
9, 28, 56 (cf. Paüma. 1. 10, 2. 60, 5. 38, etc.). The Gerundives with -ittu and
-ūna are available in this text, see I. 71, V. 43, 48, 87, 102. The form pidevi
III. 18 is Gerundive, quite usual in Apabhraṁsa; and parallels ara found in the
Paüma. 11. 99, 41. 63, 43. 48. - There is one usage of the Infinitive paribhu

ttur-je I. 45 which deserves special attention. je is used as a proclitic here.
Such forms are found in the Paümacariya also ghettumöje 1. 14, hantum-je 53.
54, näum-je 118. 62. According to Hemacandra (VIII. ii. 217) this je is
merely an expletive for pada-pürane.
At III. 58 and V. 111 jattend and loena are used in the sense of Loc.,
so also »samthiehir & -rattehi either stand for Loc., or even Gen. Similar
instances are found in the Acārānga as well. It is interesting to note that
Apabh. has a common termination -him in the Instr. and Loc. pl. Loc. for
Inst.: välaggaňte I. 24, 53 (cf. Paüm. 8. 2, 94); Loc. for Abl.: pãesu
II. 45, bāhāsu I. 37, ürūsu I. 37 (but ürühim II. 46%). -- nāma rāmena I. 7,
IV. 7, is just a repetition. Parallels for it are found in the Mahābhārata
(Virāța 2. 1), Rāmāyaṇa and Paümacariya 2. 8, 21. In the Paüma. (41. 46)
and Vasudeva-hiņdi (p. 12) nāma is suffixed to the proper name, Aggikeu-nāmo,
Jambu nāno; and these are later on again followed by rāmeņa. - One feels
from giri vva II. 34, linda vua V. 120 that perhaps vva is being used for vat.
The dialect used by Haribhadra has much common with that of
Paümacariya; and some of the traits have definite stamp of antiquity in
the evolution of Prākrits. In view of its inheritance of certain Ardhamāgadhi
characteristics and its close affinity with the idiom of Paümacariya, we may call
it Jaina Māhārāșțrī, following the terminology of Jacobi and Pischel.
The style of Dhurtākhyāna, on the whole, is simple and fluent,
and quite suited to the conversational tone in which the rogues are carrying on
their learned wrangling. Haribhadra follows here the epic model, and is
addressing an audience of mediocre education and not a learned gathering.
No artificial attempt is made to embellish the language with poetic ornaments.
The author's mastery over canonical language has unconsciously introduced
expressions like sannihia-pädihero, sannddhc-baddha-kavayā etc. (II.6, 10) which
remind us of Ardhamāgadhī phrases. In descriptions, however, the normal
style has not been maintained: long compounds are easily introduced in
describing the rainy season (I. 8 f.), Ganges (I. 25 f.), Tilottamā (I. 62 f.,
II. 29 f.), etc. The description of the cemetary (V. 82 f.), though quite
dignified as a piece of composition, is not only out of place and proportion, but
also conspicuously pedantic in its construction in this small work. The first four
fantastic tales are remarkably racy in their style, and the handling of expression
is quite in keeping with the presentation of events.

Some illustrations are already noted from the Panhāvāgaraņāim; and Dr. Sen has
observed thus: “The infinitive with je, which occurs twice (ginhiuri-je p. 122a,
ginheum-je p. 113a), occurs in the canon not earlier than in some late gāthā-prakīrṇaka."
