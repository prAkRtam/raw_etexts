SHRI BAHADURESINGHJI SINGHI
BY
Acharya Jina Vijaya Muni
On the 7th of July 1944, Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi
left his mortal coils at the comparatively early age of fifty-nine.
His loss has been widely felt. His aged mother received this
rude shock so ill that she did not long outlive him. His worthy
sons have lost an affectionate and noble father, the industrialists
and businessmen of the country one of their pioneers, the large
number of his employees a benevolent master, scholarship one of
its best patrons and the poor people of his native district a most
generous donor. To me his loss has been personal. My contact
with him was a turning point in my life. Whatever I have been
able, during the past fifteen years, to achieve in the field of
scholarship is due directly to him. The financial assistance with
which he backed up my activities was the least of his contributions.
But for his love of scholarship with which he inspired me, this
chapter of my life would have been entirely different. To his
sacred memory I am penning these few lines. This volume is
brought out in his memory.
Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji was born in Azimganj, Murshida-
bad, in Vikram Samvat 1941, in the ancient family of the Singhis,
who were of old the treasurers of the Mughal emperors. The
family had passed through many vicissitudes of fortune and in the
17th century it migrated from Rajaputana to Bengal, but thanks to
the energy and enterprise of Singhiji's father, Babu Dalchandji
Singhi, the family firm became a very flourishing concern.
At an early age Singhiji joined the family business and by
pushing ahead with father's enterprises, succeeded in making the
firm the foremost in the mining industry of Bengal and Central
India. Besides he also acquired vast zamindaries and had interests
in many industrial and banking concerns. This early preoccupa-
tion with business affairs prevented his having a college education.
But Singhiji was studious and introspective by nature. Unlike
many other wealthy men who spend their money and time in such
fads as the races, the theatres, and the like, he devoted all his
spare time to study and cultural development. He acquired an
excellent command over several languages. Art and literature
were the subjects of his choice. He was very fond of collecting
rare and invaluable specimens of ancient sculpture, paintings,
coins, copperplates and inscriptions. His manuscript collection
contained a large number of rare works of historical and cultural
importance, among which mention must be made of a unique

Page 17****************************************************************************************
manuscript of the Koran which was handed down from Baber to
Aurangzeb and bears the autographs of all of them. It is record-
ed therein that it was considered by them all as more valuable
than the empire. His numismatic collection, especially of Kushan
and Gupta coins, is considered the third best in the world. He
also had a good and large collection of works of art and historical
importance. Singhiji was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts
(London), a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, the
Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the Indian Research Institute and a
Founder-Member of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. He was also the
President of the Jain Swetambara Conference held in Bombay
in 1926. Though he had made no special study of law he was well
up in the legal matters. On one occasion when he found that his
lawyers were not properly representing his case he himself
pleaded out the case succesfully, much to the surprise of the
bench and the bar who took him for an accomplished advocate.
Though a highly religious and leading figure in the Jain
community he had an outlook which was far from sectarian.
More than three fourths of the six lakhs and over of his donations
were for non-Jain causes. More often than not he preferred to
give his assistance anonymously and he did not keep a list of his
donations even when they were made in his name. To the
Chittaranjan Seva Sadan Calcutta, he gave Rs. 10,000/-, when
Mahatmaji had been to his place for the collection of funds; to
the Hindu Academy, Daultapur, Rs. 15,000/-, to the Taraqi-Urdu
Bangala 5000/-, the Hindi Sahitya Parishad 12,500/- to the Vishud-
dhanand Sarasvati Marwari Hospital 10,000;-, to several maternity
homes 2,500,-, to the Benares Hindu University 2,500,-, to the
Jiaganj High School 5,000/-, to the Jiaganj London Mission
Hospital 6,000/-, to the Jain Temples at Calcutta and Murshidabad
11,000/-, to the Jain Dharma Pracharak Sabha Manbhum 5,000/-,
to the Jain Bhavan, Calcutta, 15,000/-, to the Jain Pustak Prachar
Mandal, Agra, 7,500/-, to the Agra Jain Temple 3,500/-, to the
Ambala Jain High School, 2,100/-, for the Prakrit Kosh 2,500/-,
and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 10,000/-. At the Singhi Park
Mela held at his Ballyganj residence in which Viscount Wavell,
then Commander-in-Chief and Lord John Herbert, Governor of
Bengal and Lady Herbert participated, he donated Rs. 41,000/- for
the Red Cross Fund.
The people of the district of Murshidabad, his native place,
will ever remain grateful to him for having distributed several
thousand maunds of rice at the low price of Rs. 8/- when rice was
selling at Rs. 24/- in those terrible years of 1942-52, himself
thereby suffering a loss of over three lakhs. In May-June 1944

Page 18****************************************************************************************
he again spent Rs. 50,000/- for the distribution of cloth, rice and
coins for the people of that place.
My close association with Singhiji began in 1931, when he
invited me to occupy the Chair for Jain Studies which he was
starting at the Vishvabharati. Due to unfavourable climatic con-
ditions of Shantiniketan I could not continue to work there for
more than four years, but during those years was founded the
Singhi Jain Series. During the period of ten years of my princi-
palship of Gujarat Puratattva Mandir, Ahmedabad, and even
before that I had been collecting materials of historical and
philological importance and folk-lore etc. which had been lying
hidden in the great Jain Bhandars of Patan, Ahmedabad, Baroda
etc. I persuaded Singhiji to start a series which would publish
works dealing with the vast materials in my possession, and also
other important Jain texts and studies prepared on the most
modern scientific lines. On the works of the Series he spent
through me more than Rs. 75,000/-. During this long period of
over a dozen years he not even once asked me as to how and for
what works the amount was spent. Whenever the account was
submitted he did not ask for even the least information, but
sanctioned it casting merely a formal glance on the accounts sheets.
But he showed the most discriminating interest in the matter that
was being published and on the material and manner in which
they were being brought out. His only desire was to see the
publication of as many works as possible during his lifetime. In
May 1943 at my instance he gave over the Series to the Bharatiya
Vidya Bhavan. In September 1943 I had been to Calcutta to
negotiate the purchase, for the Bhavan, of a well-equipped library
of a retired professor. Singhiji casually asked me what arrange-
ments had been made for meeting the cost. I promptly replied
that there was no cause for worry as long as donors like himself
were there. He smiled; he had decided. Eventually he pursuad-
ed me to go in for the Nahar Collection which was a still more
valuable one. He did not live long enough to present this literary
treasure to the Bhavan; but his eldest son and my beloved friend,
Babu Shri Rajendra Singh has fulfilled his father's wish though
he was totaliy ignorant of it and has got this unique collection for
the Bhavan and spent Rs. 50,000/- for the purpose.
By the end of 1943 his health began to decline. In the first
week of January, 1944, when I went to him at Calcutta in connes-
tion with the work of the Bharatiya Itihasa Samiti I found him
extremely unwell. Notwithstanding his ill-health he talked to me
for more than a couple of hours on the day of my arrival there.
The first thing he said in the course of this lengthy, though very

Page 19****************************************************************************************
iv
sweet talk, was to give me a mild reproof for undertaking the
long and tedious journeys to Calcutta, Benaras and Cawnpore in
spite of my ill health. He discussed with absorbing interest the
details of the Samiti's proposed History of India, a subject of
great interest to him. Our talks then drifted to the subject of the
History of Jainism in which connection also he expressed his
opinion about the material to be utilised for such a work. At the
termination of our talks, which this time lasted for over three
hours, I found him much exhausted and drooping in spirits.
On the 7th January his health took a turn for the worse. On
11th January I went to take leave of him, which he, full of emot-
ion, gave with a heavy heart, exclaiming “Who knows whether we
shall meet again or not?” I requested him to take heart and
remain buoyant. He would be soon restored to normal health.
But while I was stepping out of his room, my eyes were full of
tears and his last words began to eat into my heart. 111-luck
prevented our second meeting. That lofty and generous soul
finally left its mortal habitat at mid-day on 7th July, 1944. May
his soul rest in peace !
His sons, Babu Rajendra Singh, Babu Narendra Singh and
Babu Virendra Singh are treading in the footsteps of their revered
father. During the past year on the Singhi Series alone they have
spent over Rs. 20,000/-. I have already mentioned how Babu
Rajendra Singh purchased for the Bhavan the valuable Nahar
collection. Babu Narendra Singh has also spent Rs. 30,000/- for
a foundation of a Jain Bhavan at Calcutta. Babu Rajendra Singh
and Babu Narendra Singh have also very generously promised me
to continue to meet all the expenses of the Singhi Jain Series and
requested me to bring out as many works as possible, at whatever
cost so that this unique series founded and cherished by their late
lamented father may continue to bring to light the invaluable
treasures of Jain literature and culture.
In recognition of his unique assistance the Bharatiya Vidya
Bhayan has decided to perpetuate Singhiji's memory by naming
its Indological library after him. Further, one of its main halls
will bear his name. The Bhavan's Jain Department will also be
known as the Singhi Jain Shikshapith.*

GENERAL EDITOR'S FOREWORD
I have great pleasure in presenting to the world of scholars
Vol. I of Prof. P. K. Gode's "Studies in Indian Literary History,”
which is being published as the fourth volume of Shri Bahādur
Singhji Singhi Memorial Series established in the sacred memory
of the late Bābu Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi, the founder of the
Singhi Jain Series.
On 7th July 1944 my esteemed friend Shri Bahādur Singhji
Singhi of memorable name passed away. To perpetuate his
sacred memory a bulky issue of the Bhāratiya Vidyā, the Hindi-
Gujarati Research Journal of the Bhāratiya Vidyā Bhavan, Bombay,
was edited and published by me. This issue contained numerous
valuable contributions from distinguished scholars together with
an extensive essay by me recording my cherished reminiscences
of Singhiji. At the time of issuing this Memorial Volume it
occurred to me that a Memorial Volume of this type should be
published every year to commemorate the name of the late
Singhiji in a fitting manner. Accordingly a special issue of the
Bharatiya Vidyā (containing important articles in English) was
published as the Babu Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi Memorial
Volume. Owing to unfavourable circumstances the idea of bring-
ing out a Commemoration Volume of this type every year could
not be given effect to, though I continued my efforts in this direc-
'tion. In 1947 I undertook to publish in the present series two
volumes of Prof. P. K. Gode's “Studies in Indian Literary History,'
which present a rich collection of articles bearing on the history
and chronology of literary works and their authors. Subsequently
Prof. Gode discussed with me personally the plan of the two
volumes, giving details of the articles to be included in them, but
the difficulty of getting a suitable press fully equipped with the
necessary types and paper still remained. Luckily for these
volumes we found in Shri S. R. Sardesai, B.A., LL.B., the Manager
of the Samarth Bharat Press, Poona, a willing co-operator in our
task of getting these volumes printed carefully but the difficulty
of getting the necessary supply of paper could not be got over
immediately. After some months Shri Sardesai secured the
necessary paper for the first volume and the printing work was

Page 21****************************************************************************************
started in right earnest and completed by the end of 1950.
Immediately thereafter the printing of the second volume was
started by Shri Sardesai and it has been now brought to comple-
tion. I record here my best thanks to Shri Sardesai for his
efficient and careful execution of the printing work of both these
volumes.
The author of the present Studies in Indian Literary History,
Prof. P. K. Gode, needs no introduction to the world of Indology.
He was first introduced to me in 1919 by my most affectionate
friend the late Dr. P. D. Gune, one of the chief'founders of the
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and also its enthusiastic
Secretary upto his sad demise in 1922. In April 1919 Prof. Gode
joined the service of this Institute. I was then examining the
rich Bombay Government Collection of Mss which was shiſted
from the Deccan College to the Institute in June 1918. This
collection of Mss known as Government Mss, Library was put in
the charge of Prof. Gode and I had day to day contact with him
during the period of my stay in Poona. This contact gradually
developed into indissoluble friendship not only on account of his
unfailing courtesy and kindness in lending out Mss to me from
the Mss Library in his special charge but mainly on account of
the use made by Prof. Gode of the valuable manuscript material
that surrounded him. During the last 37 years he has published
no less than 445 original research papers (about 3500 pages).
About half the number of these papers deal with literary history:
i.e. the history and chronology of Sanskrit and Prakrit works and
their authors; the other half deals with the history of Indian
Culture. The encyclopaedic range of the subjects handled by
Prof. Gode and the strictly scientific form and character of his
published papers dealing with them have endowed them with
a reference value. In fact Prof. Gode's brother-workers in the
field of Indology like myself have been constantly asking him to
bring out all his papers in a book-form with exhaustive Indices •
As Prof. Gode has entirely dedicated his life to the service of
Sarasvati and as Sri and Sarasvati never go hand in hand it is
beyond his means to publish his writings in a book-form. It is
the duty of his rich friends and learned bodies to publish his
studies in a book-form and thus help future research in the fields

Page 22****************************************************************************************
of Indology touched by him. As a first step in this direction
I'undertook to publish the two volumes of Prof. Gode's papers
not only to satisfy my own urge to help a brother-worker in the
field of literature but also as an act of personal friendship. It is
also my proud privilege to publish in a permanent form the
results of research carried on by a pupil of my esteemed friend
the late Dr. P. D. Gune. Prof. Gode joined the service of the
Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute on the advice of his guru,
Dr. Gune. He has been serving as the Curator of the Institute
for the last 35 years and has utilised every moment of his leisure
for the promotion of Oriental learning not only by his own splen-
did example but also by his editorial work on several journals and
commemoration volumes published by him. So far as I know no
Curator of Indian Research Institutes has been able to publish as
many research papers as he has published on diverse subjects in
the field of Indology. Prof. Gode is now running his 63rd year.
I wish him long life and plenty of energy to continue his service
to Sarasvati with single-minded devotion as hitherto. The
Bhāratiya Vidyā now requires a large number of workers of the
type of Prof. Gode and I confidently hope that his example will
not fail to inspire the younger generation of scholars in a free
India, with its rich heritage of literature and culture and a brilli-
ant future now provided by a counry-wide interest in the glory
that was Ind.

INTRODUCTION
In his Foreword to the third Edition of the Bibliography' of
my Published Writings my esteemed friend Rao Bahadur K. V.
Rangaswami Aiyangar observed as follows :-“Every library and
institution interested in Indic Studies, and every scholar that can
afford the price, will require a set of the published papers. Every
student who has gained some light and guidance in his own special
field from some paper or papers of Prof. Gode will, therefore, one
feels assured, join in the prayerful hope that before a scholarly life
of such remarkable fecundity reaches its sixtieth year, the next
edition of this Bibliography will be replaced by the contents
sections of a collection of Prof. Gode's research publications and
reviews, representing the achievement of over thirty years of a life
dedicated to the discovery and propagation of historical truth."
This prayerful hope of my learned friend was not expressed
in vain. In the rainy season of 1946 I had the good fortune of
meeting after many years my old friend Acārya Muni Jinavijayaji,
when he stayed for a few days in the Nizam Guest House of the
B. O. R. Institute. I entered the service of the Institute on 26th
April 1919. At this time the Government Manuscripts Library
containing about 20,000 manuscripts was given in my special charge
and Muniji, who was then staying in the Bharata Jain Vidyalaya
near the Institute, was engaged day and night in studying the Jain
manuscripts in the Government Manuscripts Library and preparing
a Descriptive Catalogue of them and planning critical editions of
Jain texts, many of which have been published in subscquent years.
It was at this time that the bonds of friendship between myself and
Muniji were forged for the first time and strengthened in later
years even though Muniji left Poona and continued his studies out-
side Poona. During his stay in Poona referred to above I had occa-
sion to ascertain Muniji's deep interest in all my writings per.
taining to Indian literary history and the history of Indian cul
ture and allied topics. In one of our talks he expressed his great
appreciation of all my writings published in numerous Oriental
1. Thirty Years of Historical Research or Bibliography of the

of Foreword. The first Edition of this Bibliography was published in
1939 and the Second Edition of this Bibliography dedicated to my
revered guru the late Dr. P. D. Gune, was brought out in 1941 with
a Foreword by my venerable friend Principal J. R. Gharpure.

Journals since 1919 and desired that I should publish them in a
book-form. In response to this desire I estimated the extent of
my published writings and the probable cost of publishing them.
According to my estimate the total extent of my writings came up
to about 2500 printed pages, which if published in a book-form
would cost about Rs. 25000, a sum which no Indian scholar of
moderate means can afford to spend on his writings. Without
getting perturbed at the estimated cost of publishing my writings
in a book-form, Muniji spontaneously offered in a spirit of brother-
hood to publish two volumes of my studies in literary history,
each volume consisting of about 500 pages. I cannot adequately
express my sense of gratitude to Muniji for this act of brother-
hood prompted solely by his disinterested love of learning and
catholicity of literary interests, characteristic of all true devotees
of Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, worshipped alike in this
Bhāratavarşa from remote antiquity up to the present day by all
our countrymen, Brahmanical, Jain and Buddhist.
As the Director and General Editor of the Singhi Jain Series
Muni Jinavijayaji has maintained a broad outlook in the selection
of works to be published in this series. This outlook has been
doing yeoman's service to the cause of the Bhāratiya Vidyā, for the
promotion of which Muniji agreed to work as the Director of the
Bhāratiya Vidyā Bhavan, founded by his eminent friend Sri K. M.
Munshi ten years ago. In the conduct of my own studies during
the last 33 years I have also maintained a broad outlook in the
selection of problems for historical investigation as will be seen
from the contents of my Bibliography referred to above.“ Bbāratiya
Vidyā” in the broadest sense of the term includes studies per-
taining to Indian literature, Brahmanical, Jain and Buddhist.
Though the Brahmanical studies have been my main concern I
have not excluded the field of Jain literature and history from my
investigations as the two fields are intermingled. I could not carry
out any studies pertaining to the Buddhist literature for want of
Buddhist Manuscripts in our Manuscripts Library, which contains,
however, about 4000 manuscripts pertaining to the Jain field, a
source of inspiration to me as it is rich in chronological data, which
are the very back-bone of all historical research worth the name.
Some of my studies in Jain literary history included in the pre-
sent volume will amply bear out the truth of my statement.
An accurate and encyclopaedic history of Sanskrit literature
cannot be written unless all the known sources of such a history
represented by the wealth of manuscript material in our manuscript
collections, private or public, have been fully exploited by genera-

In my stuwant of chron Wrong Chence of publ.
and bihe historield. Metic as
tions of diligent research workers dedicating their lives to this
academic work of national importance. I developed this view
thirty years ago and applied myself seriously to the study of the
history and chronology of Sanskrit works as far as it could be re-
constructed on documentary evidence of published and unpubli-
shed literary sources. Wrong chronology produces wrong his-
tory and want of chronology produces no history worth the name.
In my studies I have all along endeavoured to fix the limits for the
chronology of each author and his works, known or unknown,
studied by me so that the work of the historian may become easy
and dependable for further research in the field. My approach to
the problems handled by me has been strictly realistic as I have
explained in a special article “ Indian Chronology : A Plea for
Realism” published in the Aryan Path ( June 1945, pages 201-206 ).
In all my papers I have tried to record detailed references to the
books and manuscripts used by me so that future workers may
examine my evidence and satisfy themselves about the validity of
my conclusions as limited by the evidence at my disposal. In
short my papers provide an index-finger to the varied sources of
historical research that still await exploitation and critical investi-
gation. Only when the history and chronology of all known texts
have been determined we shall be in a position to use them for the
reconstruction of Indian literary or cultural history. For the
history of Indian linguistics also the study of Indian literary
chronology is of paramount importance. I strongly hope that my
studies in literary and cultural history of India would be of some
use for the Sanskrit Dictionary on historical principles which has
been projected by my learned friend and colleague, Dr. S. M. Katre,
the Director of the Deccan College Research Institute, Poona, and
work on which has been proceeding apace through a special Sanskrit
Dictionary Department working under his guidance and supervision.
The method of historical research adopted by me is patent to
every one who has cared to carry on historical investigation in any
field of knowledge. It is, however, necessary to say a few words
about the specific technique of this method which has been res.
ponsible for the type of studies incorporated in the present
volume. To me all old manuscripts, documents, printed books,
not to say other sources of history, are worthy of reverence and
careful preservation. In fact they are the very life blood of all
historical research. Catalogues of all these sources of history in
general and Descriptive Catalogues in particular provide us an
important tool of research as they are a view-finder through which
one can have a glimpse of the vast and varied source-material for
research in different collections of manuscripts, books etc. avail-

able throughout the world. It is the duty of every genuine
research-worker in the field of Indian literary and cultural his-
tory to squeeze out this source material again and again for enrich-
ing our scanty knowledge of the specific fields of this history. In
an ideal history of literature the chronology of every author and
his literary production ought to be represented definitely or at least
within narrow limits. If we cast a glance at the entries about
works and authors in Aufrecht's Catalogus Catalogorum we find that
with the exception of a few entries for which some chronology is
available the whole catalogue looks like a big sign of interrogation
in time and space. This sign of interrogation will be enlarged when
the New Catalogus Catalogorum' is published by the University of
Madras. As inheritors of the immense wealth of literary heritage,
which would be briefly indicated in this great catalogue we would be
failing in our duty towards this treasure of knowledge if we do not
make an organised effort to reduce this sign of interrogation if not
remove it altogether in the years to come. At any rate I have spent
the best energy of my life during the last thirty years of my ser-
vice at the B. O. R. Institute in contributing my mite towards such
an organised effort. All my studies in the field of literary history
have been designed as stepping stones to a monumental history of
Indian literature, Jain, Brahmanical and Buddhist, when it comes
to be written with the help of well chiselled bricks of historical facts
and the durable cement of definite chronology gathered year after
year by an indefatigable band of literary masons working in unison
without a break,
There is nothing inherently enchanting in the dead bones
of the sources of history but they become enchanting to an investi-
gator of historical truth when he realizes the bearing of the con.
tents of these sources on the problems under his investigation. In
fact it is the spirit of investigation that makes these dead bones
alive and speak for or against a thesis which the investigator wants
to prove. Though no investigator can be a "monster of omni-
science”, he should at least try to get acquainted with the contents
of all known sources of his investigation, published or unpublished.
1. Work on this Catalogue is being done by Dr. V. Raghavan for
the last fifteen years. When completed this Catalogue would provide
a first-rate tool for research in Indian Literary History. The first
Volume of this Catalogue containing entries for the letter A-81 has
just been published. It fully justifies my expectations about its high
standard of scholarship and usefulness as I have pointed out in detail
in my review of this volume in the Hindu of Madras for 18-12-1949.

Without such acquaintance he cannot evaluate any new source
when it comes to light accidentally or through the efforts of
brother-investigators. The wider and the deeper the acquaint-
ance of an investigator with the known sources, the larger is the
number of problems that crop up for his investigation. He alone
is a “ Complete Angler” in historical research who sits patiently
on the shores of antiquity by casting a close and comprehensive
net of knotty problems and catches daily some new facts bearing
on the solution of these problems. Though I am not a “Com-
plete Angler” I have practised such angling on the shores of
Indian antiquity commensurate with the scanty leisure at my dis-
posal. I have under investigation innumerable problems and have
maintained separate “Problem files” for them. Facts bearing on
these problems, as soon as they are discovered, are noted on
separate sheets with indication of their chronology and inserted
in these files. When a sufficient number of analogous facts clari-
fying a problem is gathered in course of time these facts are
released in the form of an article. Sometimes it takes years be-
fore a problem is clarified or completely solved; but if an investi-
gator toils diligently year after year he is sure to be rewarded for
his toil by a decent number of original research papers every year
as will be seen not only from my Bibliography but from those of
other savants' in the world. The Yogavāsişıha rightly emphasises
the need, value and fruitful character of abhyasa or study in the
tollowing lines :-
" भाग्यानि यान्ति वैफल्यं नाभ्यासस्तु कदाचन"
(Yogacāsiştha, Nirvāņaprakarara,
Sarga 67, Verse 32 ).
1. The Bibliography ( 95 pages) of one of these savants, William
Healey Dall (1845-1927) published by the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, 1946, records no less than 1607 publications of this great
American Scientist whose remarks about an ideal seeker of the truth
are forcefully applicable to any ideal research worker in the field of
Indology as well. These remarks made in 1888 and quoted on the
first page of the above Bibliography are as follows :
......" Naturalists are born and not made ; that the sacred fire
cannot be extinguished by poverty nor lighted from a college taper.
That the men whose work is now classical and whose devotion it is
our privilege to honour owed less to education in any sense than they
did to self-donial, steadfastness, energy, a passion for seeking out the
truth and an innate love of nature. These are the qualities which ena-
bled them to gather fruit of the tree of knowledge."

" Fortunes may become fruitless but never 80 study"
“JATSITE: qfTum: è ala FSJA: "
(Ibid, verse 34 )
"He is the meanest wretch, who abandons the pursuit of his
ideal.” Abhyāsa is defined as " repeated application” :-
“qlargata FTOFYTTE fa pegati"
These remarks of the Yogavāsistha will not fail to carry their
message to all genuine students of all times and climes. At any
rate I have realized their full significance in my post-graduate
research work for the last thiry-three years of my life. 2
The articles included in the present volume were originally
published in different Oriental Journals and other publications at
different times. I have indicated at the commencement of each
article in a footnote the exact title of the publication in which the
article was originally published together with such details as would
facilitate a reference to the original article. In the arrangement
of articles in the volume I have generally followed the chrono-
logical order. It was, however, found impossible to give a definite
chronologial order for the entire matter included in the volume
owing to certain authors and their works being fixed up only within
broad limits of chronology, which may be narrowed down by sub-
sequent students of the problems handled by me. The idea of the
arrangement of these articles subjectwise had also to be given up
owing to the overlapping character of the material in many of the

1935, pp. 80-81 (37RTATLİAT). The Sun of abhyasa ( abhyāsa-

2. I had an occasion to point out the remarks of the Yoga-
väsiştha on abhyāsa to the audience at a function in my honour held
on 18th May, 1949 at the B. 0. R. Institute with M. M. Dr.
P. V. Kane in the chair. Though no students in the audience
approached me to learn the details of these remarks, somo pro-
fessors approached me next day and took down the exact verses from
the Yogavāsişğha quoted by me at the function.

articles. Some of the authors have written works on different sub-
jects and consequently my articles dealing with these authors and
their works could not be classified subjectwise. My only object
in bringing out my scattered articles in a book-form is to make
them available to the research students who are handicapped in
their studies for want of access to all Oriental journals in any
single library. The present volume will be useful not only to
such research students but also to me in my future work on account
of the exhaustive Indices prepared by my learned friends Dr.
A. D. Pusalker, M. A., LL. B., Ph. D. of the Bhāratiya Vidya Bhavan,
Bombay, and Principal N. A. Gore, M. A. of the Kanara College,
Kumta. These Indices enhance the reference-value of the
volume. I am deeply indebted to both these friends for their
arduous labour of love, which is a token of their brotherly affection
for me and disinterested devotion to Sarasvati. The first of these
Indices, a work of immense scholarly labour, was prepared by
Dr. Pusalker in spite of his heavy work as Assistant Editor of the
History of India projected by the Bhāratiya Vidyā Bhavan, and
sent to me punctually as soon as I completed the printing of my
articles in the Volume. The second Index, no less scholarly and
important, was prepared by Principal Gore in spite of all his
literary work and administrative commitments, as Principal of a
newly started college and sent to me just in time as soon as I
completed the printing of Dr. Pusalker's Index. One rarely
enjoys such self-less and dependable scholarly collaboration in
one's literary endeavours.

In the Introduction to the Bibliography of my writings pub.
lished in 1947 I have thanked all my friends and well-wishers,
,whose co-operation and blessings have encouraged me to carry on
my researches in Indian literary and cultural history for over three
decades. It remains for me to thank some of these friends who
have directly helped me in the publication of the present volume.
Among these friends I have to convey my cordial thanks to my
esteemed friend and literary confrère, Dr. S. M. Katre, M. A.,
Ph. D., whose advice and co-operation not only in all our joint
efforts for the promotion of Indology during the last sixteen years
but also in my own research work I have fortunately enjoyed with-
out a break. As far as possible I have followed his very useful
suggestions with regard to the arrangement and publication of the
papers included in the present volume. Special thanks are due to,
Mr. S. N. Savadi, B. A. ( Hons.), the senior assistant of the Manus-
cript Department and Mr. G. N. Shrigondekar, B. A., the Librarian
of the B. O. R. Institute, for their willing co-operation in the

correction of some of the proofs, especially of the Indices to the
Volume.
As Curator of the B. O. R. Institute for over 30 years I have
enjoyed the privilege of the friendship and unstinted co-operation
of all the past and present office-bearers and other members of the
Institute. I take this opportunity of recording my most cordial
thanks to all these friends, some of whom are unfortunately not
living to-day to see the publication of this volume ! Among these
departed friends I remember with gratitude and reverence my
friend and guru the late Dr. P. D. Gune, M. A., Ph. D. ( died 1922 ),
who put me on the path to Indology, and the late Dr. V. S. Suk-
thankar, M. A., Ph. D. ! died 1943), the General Editor of the Maha-
bhārata, who was my friend and colleague for 17 years (1925-1943).
Dr. Sukthankar's daily scholarly contact with me during this
period gave the most vitalising stimulus and encouragement to
my sustained literary endeavour of almost a quarter of a century.
Among friends from whom I have received considerable
encouragement in all my work at the Institute I must gratefully
mention Principal J. R. Gharpure, B. A., LL. B. and Dr. R. N.
Dandekar, M. A., Ph. D., who as Chairman of the Executive Board
and Secretary of the Institute respectively for the last ten years
have tried their best to promote its growth in spite of the difficul-
ties created by the great world war. Thanks are also due to all the
members of the staff, especially Mr. Y. R. Junnarkar ( Assistant.
Curator), Mr. G. N. Shrigondekar (Librarian), and Messers G. S.
Deshpande and G. B. Kulkarni, whose loyalty to the Institute
and harmonious co-operation with me have facilitated all my
administrative work as Curator of the Institute for more than
35 years. In 1935 the work of the preparation and publication of
the several Volumes of the Descriptive Catalogue of the Govt.
Manuscripts Library was entrusted to me by the Executive
Board. I started this work with the help of two assistants Dr. M.
M. Patkar, B.A., Ph. D. and Mr. S. N. Savadi, B. A. (Hons.). In 1943
Dr. Patkar joined the Deccan College Research Institute and
Mr. Savadi took his place as senior assistant in the Manuscript
Department. I record my best thanks to these co-workers for
their careful and conscientious work not only on the Descriptive
Catalogue but in other matters connected with this Department.
. The present volume of my studies happily inaugurates a new
series of Memoirs called "Shri Bahadur Singh Singhi Series "
started in memory of the late Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi ( 1885-
1944 ), the magnanimous and enlightened founder of the Singhi
Jain Series, by his great friend Acārya Muni Jinavijayaji. Two
e of my

volumes have already been published as commemoration volumes
in memory of the late Shri Bahadur Singhji but this series of
Memoirs has been commenced with the express purpose of com-
memorating his illustrious name permanently. This series of
Memoirs will include all critical studies pertaining to Indian litera-
ture while the Singhi Jain Series will contain critical editions not
only of texts pertaining to Jain literature but also those pertain.
ing to Indian literature in general.
The Singhi Jain Series is the fruit of the pious liberality of
Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi and commemorates the name of
his revered father Babu Shri Dalchandji Singhi (1865-1927), who
was a great patron of learning throughout his life. It is one of the
declared aims of this Series to publish not only the critical editions
of texts but also critical Studies by competent research scholars on
all branches of Indian Literature, which are the glorious literary
heritage of India. The volumes so far published in the Singhi
Jain Series have already endeared themselves to Indologists all
over the world. Literature knows no limitations of time and
clime and I hope that the Singhi Jain Series of the critical editions
of texts and the Shri Bahadursingh Singhi Memoris of critical studies
inaugurated by this volume, will grow in content and world-wide
literary prestige under the distinguished editorship of my esteemed
friendĀcārya Muni Shri Jinavijayaji. The life-long services of
Muniji to Indian literature and culture have been very great and
they have been fittingly recognised by no less an academic body
than the German Oriental Society, who have made him their Hono-
rary Member. I take this opportunity of recording here my most
hearty congratulations to Muniji upon this unique international
honour conferred on him by this noblest body of the Orientalists'
world and wish him long life and good health to continue his dis-
interested services to the Bhāratiya Vidya.
Though Babu Bahadur Singhji Singhi, the noble and illustrious
founder of the Singhi Jain Series is no more with us to continue
his ceaseless efforts for furthering the cause of our ancient litera-
ture and culture, his two worthy sons, Babu Rajendra Singh Singhi
and Babu Narendra Singh Singhi have been carrying out the pious
wishes of their revered father in promoting this sacred cause. I
cannot adequately express my sense of gratitude and appreciation
for their genuine love of learning and the spirit of benefaction,
which have contributed in no small way to the distinguished pron)
gress of the Singhi Jain Series.
In conclusion I offer my sincere thanks to my friend Shri S. R.
Sardesai, B. A., LL. B., the Manager of the Samartha Bharat Press,

Page 37****************************************************************************************
Poona, for his careful and expeditious printing of the present
volume in spite of all difficulties through which all presses in
India had to pass during the last five years. Since 1920 Shri Sar-
desai has been a life-worker of the Samantha Vidyalaya, of which I
was a student in the year ( 1906-07 ) of its foundation by Prof. V. G.
Vijapurkar. It is a happy coincidence that the Samartha Bhārat
Press ( conducted by the Samartha Vidyalaya of Talegaon near
Poona ) which printed the third edition of the Bibliography of my
writings in 1947 should print in 1953 this first volume of my
studies. My contact with Prof. Vijapurkar though short has left
on my mind an indelible stamp of his self-sacrificing life, burning
patriotism, deep learning and spotless character.
As iny revered Guru the late Dr. Pandurang Damodar Gune
initiated me into the study of the Bharatiya Vidya and his great
friend Acārya Muni Sri Jinavijayaji has initiated the publication
of this first volume of my studies, I have taken the liberty of
dedicating it to both these benefactors in partial redemption of
the heavy debt of gratitude I owe to them.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
literature, philosophy and religion as it will give us a skeleton
outline of the history of Jaina Schools and the several acāryas that
were associated with them. This is, however, a subject to be
tackled by students interested in the history of Jaina literature and
religion. In the absence of any encyclopaedic work dealing with
the various Jaina Schools and their historical development it would
be useful to collect and record data pertaining to the several
schools separately to facilitate a closer study of them, as also to
enable us to understand the interrelations of these schools through
changing vicissitudes of political and religious history of India.
In the present paper I shall confine myself to one Gaccha viz.
the Caitragaccha of Chitor in Rajputana and shall record a few
references to it in inscriptions and literature.
(1) The Prasasti Samgraha' records the following colophon of
a MS of the Meghadūta in a Bhandar at Pātan :-
___ "संवत् १६०४ 2 वर्षे वैशाख सुदि २ भूमवासरे श्रीचंत्रगच्छे भ० श्री. ६ नयकीर्ति-
सूरि सूरीन्द्रान् ॥ तत शिष्य मू. विनयकीर्तिलिखितं स्ववाचनाय, चित्रांगद दुर्गमध्ये ।।
SFTTFT 11 sf 11"
The above colophon of A.D. 1547 gives us the names of two
Jainas viz., (1) Nayakirlik and (2) V'inayakirti associated with the
(Continued from previous page )
Kannada Inscriptions, ed. by Shamasastry and Lakshminarayan Rao,
1939– Ins. No. 278). Vide also p. 400 of the above volume, where an
inscription of A. D. 1297 records the gift of some land to farmaa,
disciple of नमिचंद्र रावुक of the पुस्तकगच्छ, देशीगण and मूलसंध. On p. 89
again we have inscription No. 115 dated A. D. 1054 which mentions
a Jain teacher belonging to H IT, ESTIUT and CITTTTT777.
1. Ed. by A. M. Shah, Part II, p. 102.
2. This MS was copied in April 1547.
3. In the Chitor Stone inscription of A. D. 1287 engraved on
a pillar about a mile or so from Chitor in the reign of Samara-Simha
a grant is made to the temple of Vaidyanātha built on a tank called
Citrānga (mod. Chitrang Moris tank at Citrakuța (Vide H. C. Ray :
Dynastic History of Northern India II, p. 1194). In a MS copied in
in Saṁvat 1597 ( = A. D. 1541) i.e. six years earlier than the
Meghadūta MS of A. D. 1547 we find the mention of Citrakūta
durga" in the reign of “Rājādhiraja Śrī Vaņavīra" and the Gaccha
existing at Chitor is styled as “Añcala Gaccha.”
4. 'The Jain Granthāvali does not mention any author of
the name Nayakirti. Winternitz (His. of Ind. Lit. II, Calcutta, 1933)
& S. Vidyabhusana (Ind. Logic, 1921) make no reference to any
author of this name in their Chapters on "Jaina Literature'.
(pp, 424 ---595) and “Jain Logic'' (pp. 158--224) respectively.

CAITRAGACCHA IN INSCRIPTIONS AND LITERATURE
Caitragaccha in the Chitor fort. The Pattāvali No. 1 of the
Kharatara Gaccha contains the following dated reference to
Citrakūța or Chitor :-
Death of Jinavallabhasūri at Citrakūța in Saṁvat 1168
(= A.D. 1112).'
If the above date of the death of Jinavallabhasūri at Citrakūta is
correct it shows the association of the Kharataragaccha with Chitor
at the beginning of the 12th Century but it does not help us to
know the history of the Caitragac cha mentioned in the Meghadūta
MS referred to above.
Kșemakirti, pupil of Vijayendu and belonging to Candrakula
composed his commentary on the Bịhatkalpasūtra in Samvat 1332
i. e. A. D. 1276. At the end of his commentary he possibly refers
to the genesis of the Caitragaccha in the following verses :
"श्रीजैनशासन-नभस्तल-तिग्मरश्मिः
श्री सम्म चांद्रकुल-पप्रविकाशकारी ।

the Caitragaccha mentioned by Kșemakirti !

knowledge. Citrapura' mentioned by Kșemakirti appears to be
identical with modern Chitor. If this identification is correct it is
but in the fitness of things that such an illustrious Jainācārya
should be the founder of the Caitragaccha, the existence of which
in the latter part of the 13th century and its continuity to the
middle of the 16th century is proved by inscriptional and literary
sources.
1. Chitor is mentioned in historical references as faits, 1977,

used in documents or elsewhere. The Prasasti Sangraha by A. M.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The name Dhaneśvara Sūri is very commonly met with in the
literature of the Jainas. It is, therefore, necessary to identify him
if possible and for this purpose we shall have to note all the
namesakes' of Dhaneśvara in dated sources, who flourished before
A. D. 1276 the date of composition of Kșemakirti's commentary on
the BỊhatkalpasūtra.
The Jesalmere Inscriptions edited by P. C. Nahar contain the
following references to the Caitra Gaccha :-
1. A MS of Yogaśāstravịtti was copied for Dhanesvara Sūri at
Sri Pattana in Samvat 1255 ( = A. D. 1199) Vide Prasasti Sangraha
Part I, p. 82 (Pr. 130;-897 9844 añ ar ufo 9 Tatil 3198 »t qua
श्रीदेवाचार्यवसत्यां श्रीधनेश्वरसूरीणां हेतोदशसहस्रयोगशास्त्रवृत्तिं परमश्रावकठक्कुरवर्ध.
Alaa FIATYTATTEJOT TUTTO ATT571441a Faserſtat etc. Part II, p. 93--In
a MS dated Samvat 1592 ( = A. D. 1536) the Sūris of the artar 759
viz., Tia T, TAGATART, TATATT etc., are mentioned. This Dhane-
śvara sūri has no connection with our Dhaneśvara on account of the
difference of chronology and the difference of the Gacchas,
One Dhanesvarasûri of the 17719 17 is mentioned in the Jesal-
mere Inscription No. 2230 dated Samvat 1329 ( = A. D. 1273) but he is
obviously a different person as he does not belong to the Caitra Gaccha
(Vide p. 61 of Jesalmere Inscriptions III by P. C. Nahar, Calcutta,
1929). Two more namesakes of this Sūri are found in the same
Gaccha in inscriptions dated Samvat 1476 ( = A. D. 1420) and Samvat
1527 ( = A. D. 1471) vide Inscription Nos. 2291 and 2348 in the above
volume of Jesalmere Inscriptions. It would appear that Dhaneśvara-
Būri of the Nänaki ya Gaccha living in A. D. 1273 was a contemporary
of Kșema-Kirti who composed his commentary on the BỊhat-Kalpa-
sūtra in A. D. 1276 i. e. three years after the Jesalmere Inscription of
A. D. 1273.
While dealing with Jain influence under the Paramara Kings
Dr. D. C. Gongoly (Paramāra Dynasty 1933, p. 250) states that
"Dhaneśvara lived in Malwa during the reign of Muñja." This
Dhanesvara belonged to Raja Gaccha (Vide p. iii of Peterson's Fourth
Report). The last known date of Muñja or Vākpati II is A. D. 993-4
(Vide p. 80 of Parm. Dynasty).

The Jesalmere inscriptions noted in the above statement bear
further testimony to the continuity of the Caitra Gaccha between
A. D. 1271 and A. D. 1447. We have already quoted the colophon
of a Meghadūta MS of A. D. 1547 which carries further this
continuity exactly by 100 years. With a view to having a thorough
knowledge of the several sūris belonging to the Caitra Gaccha and
their contribution to Jain and non-Jair literature and philosophy,
it is necessary to record the names of these sūris as found in
references to them in the entire Jain literature published and
unpublished but this is a task which must be left to scholars who
have specialized in the history of Jain religion and philosophy.
I have, therefore, great pleasure in recording below the information
about the Caitru Gaccha kindly sent to me by my friend Prof. A. N.
Upadhye of Kolhapur :-
The Caitra Gaccha is also called Citra or Citrarála
Gaccha. It is not so popular as Kharatara or Tapā Gaccha.
From a book called “Jaina Dhātu.pratimā Lekha Sangraha
by Buddhisāgara (Bombay, Samvat 1973), the following
facts may be noted :--

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The dates recorded in the above conspectus show an unbroken
continuity of the Caitra Gaccha for about 276 years between the
years A. D. 1271 and 1547. We have also seen that various
Jainācāryas were associated with the Caitra Gaccha during this period
and it should be a matter for investigation how and to what extent
they advanced the cause of Jain religion, literature and philosophy.
The text of the earliest inscription' of A. D. 1271 containing the
reference to the Caitra Gaccha reads as follows :-
"संवत् १३२७ वर्षे फागुण सुदि १२ हरिचंद्रपुत्र जठासीह भगिणि मोहिणि
आत्मश्रेयोथं बिंबं कारितं ॥ प्रतिष्टितं श्रीचैवगच्छे श्रीअजितसिंहमूरिसंताने श्रीकनक-
quaffat: "
This text shows that Kanakaprabhasūri of the Caitra Gaccha in
the line of Ajitasimhasūri was living in A. D. 1271.
It is now necessary for us to take the history of the Caitra
Gaccha backward from A. D. 1271 and for this purpose the Chirava
Inscription of the time of Samarasimha of Mewar of Vikrama
Samvat 1330 ( = A. D. 1273) is very much useful as it refers to the
Jainācāryas of the Caitra Gaccha in the following verses' :-

torically by Mr. Haldar. Exact date of the inscription is Friday.
13th October 1273.
3. Mr. Haldar gives us the following English summary of these
verses :-Page 286- "Then follows the description of the Jain

The line of ācāryas as we find recorded in A. D. 1273 in the
above prašasti composed by Ratnaprabhasüri and recorded by his
pupil Pārsvacandra is as follows :-
(१) भद्रेश्वरसूरि (of चैत्रगच्छ)
(२) देवभद्रसूरि
(३) सिद्धसेनरि
(४) जिनेश्वरसूरि
(५) विजयसिंहसूरि
(६) भुवनचंद्रसूरि
(७) रत्नप्रभसूरि
Yliving in A. D. 1273
(८) पाचचंद्र
This line of Bhadreśvara sūri in the Caitra Gaccha existing in
A. D. 1273 and represented by Ratnaprabha and his pupil
Pārsvacandra appears to be different from the line of Ajitasimha
of the same Gaccha mentioned in the inscription of A. D. 1271 and

Page 51****************************************************************************************
STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
represented by Kanakaprabhasūri then living. Evidently Ratna-
prabha and Kanakaprabha were contemporary ācāryas of the same
Caitra Gaccha.
The line of Bhadreśvarasūri of the Caitra Gaccha mentioned by
Ratnaprabha in A. D. 1273 as having 6 ācāryas preceding him
enables us to take the antiquity of the Caitra Gaccha to about
1100 A D. if not a little earlier, presuming that a generation of the
teacher and his pupil represents about 25 years and presuming also
that Ratnaprabha's list of his predecessors is accurately recorded.
We must, however, search for definite historical evidence for study-
ing the details of the lives of the 6 predecessors of Ratnaprabha
(living in 1273 A. D.).
Ratnaprabha states that the Kings Visvaladeva and Tejaḥsimha
honoured him (v. 48 of the praśasti). Tejasimha belonged to the
ruling line of the Guhilaputras of Medapāța or Mewar, a genealogi-
cal table of which has been recorded by Dr H.C. Ray. As Tejasimha's
dates are c. 1260–1267 A. D. and as he honoured Ratnaprabhasūri
of the Caitra Gaccha we can presume that Ratnaprabha's influence
at the Mewar Court was sustained say between A. D. 1260 and
1273. This conclusion is supported by a further inscription? found
near Chitor which is dated. Samvat 1322 i.e. A. D. 1265 and its pra-
śasti which was composed by Ratnaprabha Sūri of the Caitra Gaccha.
Another inscription", mentioning Hemacandra Sūri and others of
the Caitra Gaccha, is the Chitor Stone inscription dated Samvat
1324 i.e. A. D. 1267. It is incised on a stone fixed on an arch of
the bridge on the Gambhiri river near Clitor. This stone is said to
have originally belonged to the temple of Mahāvīra at Talahati at
the foot of the Chitrakūta hill.
Though the evidence of literature and inscriptions recorded in
this short inquiry about the antiquity of the Caitragaccha takes us

safely to about A. D. 1100, the Jain tradition' as based on the
Pațțāvalis claims the existence of a Sākhā of Mūla Sangha
(Digambar School) at Chitor right from 515 B. C. upto A. D. 1881.
The Patļāvalis no doubt provide good data for historical verification
but they need to be linked up with epigraphic and other objective
evidence for a reliable reconstruction of Jain chronology and
history.

1. Vide Appendix E (Chronological List of the Gaccha-heads) to
the Epitome of Jainism by Puran Chand Nahar, Calcutta, 1917,
p. 1xxix--Mr. Nahar states that the Nandi Sanga (Chitor Śākhā) was
founded by Meghanandin , disciple of Guptigupta or Arhadbali and
is also known as Sarasvati Gaccha, and Balātkāra Gaņa. "The list of
Gaccha heads recorded by Mr. Nahar is based upon the Patļāvali as
published in the Jaina Sidhānta Bhāskara and by Dr. Hoernle
in the Indian Antiquary (Vol. XX, pp. 341--361 and Vol. XXI
pp. 51-84). The pontiffs of this Gaccha, adds Mr. Nahar, gene-
rally use the four surnames viz., Nandin, Candra, Kirti, and
Bhūşana. The table begins with Gautama the first Gañadhara or
disciple of Mahāvīra, who is known as the founder of the Mūla-
sangha by the Digambaris.

2. The Bhagavadgită in the pre-Samkarācārya
Jain Sources*
In his recent paper' on the:Kashmir recension of the Bhagavad-
gita Dr. S. K. Belvalkar examines the views of Dr. F. Otto Schrader
of Kiel to the effect that the text of the Bhagavadgitā, to which the
Gitābhāşya of Samkarācārya gave currency (and consequently the
Gitābhāșya itself) was completely unknown in Kashmir upto 1000
A. D. Dr. Belvalkar also examines in detail Schrader's hypothesis
about a Kashmir recension of the Gitā. In the course of this exa-
mination he observes :-“ Once Schrader's thesis is accepted as
proved, it raises the possibility of other recensions of the poem being
current at different times in different parts of India.'??
What different recensions of the Bhagavad gitā, if any, were
current at different times in different parts of India, no one can say
with any degree of certainty. In the same manner it would be
hazardous to conclude the impossibility of different recensions
simply because no evidence in their suppport, of an incontrovertible
nature has yet been discovered and recorded. In the present
unsettled state of this problem it would be useful to collect all
possible data about the text of the Gità as found recorded in the
form of quotations in works prior in date to the Gitābhāşya of
Sri Sankarācārya with a view to seeing if as a cumulative effect of
this data we can assert or deny the possibility of different recen-
sions of the Gită current at different times in different parts
of India.
If the importance of pre-Samkarācārya quotations from the
Gitā occurring in Brahmanical or non-Brahmanical texts is recog.
nized to possess some value for historical or textual criticism, an
attempt will be made by interested scholars to record all such
quotations as they are traced during the course of their studies. In
the present paper I shall record some such quotations from a Jain
source.3

BHAGAVADGITA IN THE JAIN SOURCES
· Recently I had an occasion to peruse the works of Haribhadrasūri.
During the course of niy perusal I came across some verses which
looked like quotations from the Gita . I, therefore, tried to read
these works rather minutely with a view to tracing verses common
'to these works and the Gita. The verses traced so far may be
recorded in this paper to enable scholars to trace any more verses
common to the Gitā and otler works of Haribhad rasūri, not
included in the pothi before me.
According to Muni Jinavijayaji 2 Haribhadra flourished in the
middle of the 8th century A. D. Prof. Jacobi' accepts this dare
and the evidence on which it is based and observes that Muni
Jinavijayaji "puts his case in the clearest light.” Udyotana in his
Kuvalayamālā completed on 21st March, 779 A. D. mentions
(Continued from previous page)
"देशे ततो विविक्ते समे शुचौ जन्तुविरहिते कल्पे ।
ऋज्वायम्य स देहं बचा पल्यङ्कमचलाङ्गः ॥२॥

विपयेभ्य इन्द्रियाणि प्रत्यवहत्य च मनस्तथा तेभ्यः।
धारयति मनः स्वात्मनि योगं प्रणिधाय मोक्षाय ॥५॥"
This passage reminds us of the lines of the Bhagavadgitá such as-
" विविक्तसवी लध्वाशा" (XVIII 52); " शुचौ दशे प्रतिष्टाप्य ( (VI, 11); “ मुनिमाक्ष-
परायणः" (VI, 2.); " ध्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य रन्यक्" (VIII, 10); "यदा संहरते चायं"

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Haribhadra as his teacher in philosophy and praises him as the
author of a great many books. Haribhadra quotes many authors,
Brahmanical, Buddhist and Jaina', among whom we find Bhartſhari
(the author of the Vākyapadiya) about 650 A. D. and Kumārila.
Haribhadra also quotes several passages from the Cūrņi of the
Nandisutra by Jinadāsagani-mahattara ( A. D. 677). On the other
hand he does not quote Samkarācārya or discuss his māyāvāda.
The birth-place of Haribhadra was Citrakūța or the modern Chitor.
He was a Brahman by caste. It was chiefly due to him that
Sanskrit became the learned language of the Svetāmbaras and
replaced Prakrit in several departments of their literature. He
shows perfect mastery in philosophical discussion conducted in
Sanskrit side by side with his comprehensive knowledge of Jain
Lore due to his conversion to Jainism.?
With the foregoing remarks about the chronological and biogra-
phical details about Haribhadrasūri it would be easy to understand
the following verses found as part of Haribhadra's works, without
mention of their source or without any indication to suggest that
they are quotations from a Brahmanical work like the Bhagavad-
gītā :-
(1) Verse 76 of the Šāstravārtā samuccaya of Haribhadrasūri
(folio 52 of the pothi Edition of 1939 ) reads as follows :-
"नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः।
उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्वनयोस्तस्वदर्शिभिः ॥ ७६ ॥"
This verse is exactly identical with Gītā II, 16. Haribhadra must
have taken it from the Gitū. In Jacob's Concordance no other

The verses of the Gitä identified by me in Haribhadra's works

(:) I.ckatativanirnaya-Gitā, II, 23, 24; 1, 5, 14 ; XIII, 13 ;
XV. 1, 16.
In addition to the eight verses from the Gitā traced in Hari.
bhadra's works, I found certain verses and portions of verses
echoing some lines from the Gita, e.g. verse 21 of Sastrarārtā-
samuccaya (Folio 74) reads as follows :-
"उन्मकृत्युजराव्याधिरोगशोकायुपदतः ।

recension of the Gità and also by Vallabhācārya,

BHAGAVADGITA IN THE JAIN SOURCES
In the Yogadrstisamuccaya (folio 6) we find the line "at नि-
मसंमोहविविधो बोध इष्यते" which may be compared with Gita, X,4 -
___ "बुद्धिर्शानमसंमोहः क्षमा सत्यं दमः शमः।"
A study of the Brahmanical sources' of Haribhadra's works
would prove profitable if no such study has been already made by
Jain scholars. In view of the early Brahmanical training and
proficiency in the Sastras attained by Haribhadra it is but natural
that he should absorb in his writings some of the Brahmanical
material with a stamp of his new faith, The Gită appears to have been
very popular with later Jain writers as well, though it is difficult to
guarantee the accuracy? of these quotations in all cases.
1. Cf. शास्त्रवार्तासमुच्चय (folio 56) :-
"काल: पचति भूतानि कालः संहरति प्रजाः ।
काल; सुप्तेषु जागर्ति कालोहि दुरातक्रमः ॥"
This may be compared with Maitri u panișad Vi, 15 which
reads :-
"काल: पचति भूतानि सर्वाण्येव महात्मनि ।
यस्मिस्तु पच्यते कालो यस्तं वेद स वेदवित् ॥ १५॥"
(Vide p. 417 of Upanisads, Anandashram, Poona, 1891.)
Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar has drawn my attention to the following
verse in the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata (B. O. R. I.)
Adiparvan 1, 1, 190—
"कालः पचति भूतानि कालः संहरति प्रजाः।"
The 2nd line of Haribhadra's text as indicated above is found only
in the Northern Recension of the MBH (l'ide p. 29 of Adiparvan).
2. Cf. the following quotation from the Gitā as such appearing
in the Bharateśvara-bāhubali-vítti (Devachand Lalbhai P. Fund

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
.: From the data recorded above we may arrive at the following
conclusions for furtlier verification in
(1) Haribl.adrasūri ic, 750 A. D.) had before him some text
of ile Gitå which wiis different from the vulgate text.
() The absorption of the verses pointed out above by Hari-
bhadrasūri in his own works without acknowledgment was perhaps
due to his early Bral:manical training in the Sāstras.
(3) It is also possible to suppose that the variants in the
verses absorbed by Haribhadra from the Gită are due not as a result
of a different version of the text then current but may be due to
his own making.
it) It should be a matter for investigation whether any other
pre. Samkara Jain writers have drawn upon the Gită incidentally or
otherwise in the works composed by them.
(5) An exhaustive study of pre-Samkara quotations Brahma-
nical, Jain, or Buddhist, if any, would clarify the present theory
that Sarıkarā ārya establisl.ed ile vulgate text of the Gità.
P.S. Since this paper was sent to the press, I have discovered
the following verses in a Jain work called the Padmapurāna written
in the year 678 A. D. by Ravişeņa (see Ind. Literature Vol. II by
Winterniiz, p. 494):-
Ms No. 301 of 1883. S:4 (B.O.R. Institute --Govt. Mss Library),
folio 104 ;-
"विद्याविनयसंपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।
gra 67 915 5 0f31: ra: 11 3 !!
Compare the 2nd verse in the above quotation with Gită, VI, 30:-
"यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वच मयि पश्यति ।
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति ॥"
I am unable to trace the 1st verse of the above quotation in the vul-
gate text of the Gitä even in the verses of Chap. X (19 to 42 dealing
with Vibhūtiyoga). Subhasila comsosed the Bharateśvaravſtti in
A. D. 14:3 Samvat 1509). Unlike Haribhadra of the 8th century A.D.,
he mentions the Gitā and quotes verses from it, one of which cannot
be traced in the present vulgate text of the Gitā, while the other
shows marked variants in the first line. Can we suppose that
Subhaśīla had before him a text of the Gita differing from the vulgate
one or he is merely quoting from memory and in so doing warping the
original verse in one case & composing another in the style of the Gita?
ke Haribhérom it, one whil

BHAGAVADGITÀ IN THE JAIN SOURCES
चातुर्वण्य तथान्यच्च चंडालादिविशेषणं ।
सर्वमाचारभेदेन प्रसिद्धि भुवने गतम् ॥ ४ ॥"
Verse 3 in the above extract is exactly identical with Gitā, V,
18, while verse 4 is an echo of Gitā, IV, 13 which reads as follows :-
"चातुर्वण्यं मया सृष्टं गुगकर्मविभागशः ।
तस्य कतारमपि मां विशकर्तारमव्ययं ॥ १३ ।। "
If the above extract from Ravişena's text of A. D. 678 is
genuine it shows how Jain authors have indirectly absorbed the
text of the Gita from the version available to them.

3. Date of Malayagirisūri-
Between A. D. 1100 and 1175 +
Winternitz' in his History of Indian Literature states that a MS
of Malayagiri's commentary on Karmaprakſti is dated 1395 A. D.,
a MS of the commentary on the Nandisūtra is dated 1235 A. D.,
a MS of the commentary on the Vyavahāra-Sūtra is dated 1253 A. D.
Peterson refers to the several works of Malayagiri and states that
this writer's Sabdānušāsana was written in the reign of Kumārapāla.
Kielhorn states that one of Malayagiri's works was composed in
Kumārapāla's reign between 1143 and 1174 A. D. I wonder why
Winternitz has not recorded the above date for Malayagiri as given
by Kielhorn and referred to by Peterson. In case he had any
doubts in accepting the date given by Kielhorn we shall have to
see if these doubts are justified on the strength of other evidence
in support of or against Kielhorn's date for Malayagiri.
In the Catalogue of Manuscripts in the Jain Bhandars at Patan
there are certain dated MSS of works, the author of which is stated
to be Malayagiri. These MSS may be recorded as follows with
their dates :

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
It will be seen from the two foregoing tables of dated MSS.
ascribed to Malayagiri that they were copied in the years A. D.
1165, 1192, 1233, 1234, 1240, 1275, 1276, 1322, 1335, 1381, 1390,
1406, 1424, 1425, 1427, 1432, 1433, 1434. The earliest dated MS.
of Malayagiri's work recorded by Winternitz is dated A. D. 1235
while in the above chronological tables we have four MSS. of
Malayagiri's works' bearing dates earlier than A.D. 1235 viz., A.D.
1165, 1192, 1233, 1234. According to Kielhorn Malayagiri wrote
during King Kumārapāla's reign i.e., between A. D. 1143 and 1174.
This statement, though not mentioned by Winternitz and accepted,
appears to be corroborated by the dates A. D. 1165 and 1192 of
Malayagiri's two works Agraritat and 9entrasfat. We may, there-
fore, safely fix A. D. 1165 as one of the limits for the date of
Malayagiri, the other limit being about A. D. 1050 as will be seen
from the following evidence :-
Malayagiri in his commentary on the Avasyakasūtra mentions
Prajñākaragupta and quotes a versefrom his work as follows :---
"Ja TTT
यथा वा प्रेर्यते तूलमाकाशे मातरिश्वना ।
तथा शब्दोऽपि किं वायोः प्रतीपं कोऽपि शब्दवित् ॥"
This appears to me to be a quotation from one of the Sanskrit
works of Prajñākara Gupta who was a Buddhist logician belonging
to about 940 A. D.' It may be possible for students of Buddhist
--

1. For the names of works of Malayagiri vide Jain-Granthāvali,
pp. 4,6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 20, 40, 42, 64, 100, 115, 117, 119, 120, 125.
2. Vide folio 29a of the Pothi Edition of the Avasyakasūtra
with Malayagiri's Commentary (Agamodaya Samiti No. 56) 1928.
3. Vide p. 336 of the History of Indian Logic by S. Vidya-
bhushana, Calcutta, 1921. Prajñākara Gupta lived at the time of
Mahipāla, who died in 940 A. D. He wrote the following works :--
Pramāņavārtikālamkāra, a commentary on the Pramâna.
vārtika of Dharmakirti. Vidyabhushan states that the
Sanskrit original of this work of P. Gupta appears to be
lost. Recently, however, the work has been recovered
and edited by Rāhula Sānkſtyāyana in the Journal of the
Bihar and Orissa Res. Soc. Vol. XXI, Part II (1935).
There is also a Tibetan translation of the work.

literature to trace the above verse in P. Gupta's one of the two
Sanskrit works."! If the author of the name Prajñākara Gupta
mentioned by Malayagiri is identical with the celebrated Buddhist
logician of that name we may safely fix A. D. 1050 or so as the
other limit to the date of Malayagiri. It would thus be seen that
the date of Malayagirisūri may be taken to lie between A. D. 1100
and 1175.2
.
1. One of these two works viz., the Pramāņavārtlikālamkāro has
been fortunately recovered for us by Rāhula Sānkſtyāyana (Vide p. 42
of Jour. Bihar and Orissa Res. Soc. Vol. XXI (March 1935)]. The
MS described by him consists of 59 leaves and contains Chapters Il
and III of the work. This MS has been published in the June 1935
issue of the above journal (rp. 1 to 158). The published fortion is
fragmentary as it begins from the Kārikā 330 of the text (vide p. 63).
It ends with Karikā 539 (p. 158) and is called 42291 Cf. Colophon
"Gamarra717817967ETRO fara:” which corresponds to the 3rd
Pariccheda of the text of the Pramāņavārttika as stated by the Editor
in the footnote on p. 158.
2. In the Abhidhānarājendra Vol. VI (1923) p. 156 there is a
small article on Malayagiri but it contains no historical information
about this author. The compilers of this encyclopaedia, however,
observe :- .
"मलयगिरेः समयो गुरुपरंपरादिकं च न ज्ञायते तथापि हरिभद्रसूरेराक्तन इति ज्ञायते"
The date of Haribhadrasūri is about 750 A. D.

Page 65****************************************************************************************
4. Mammața and Hemacandra
In his chapter' on Mammații and Allaţa Dr. S. K. De
observes : “A great deal of uncertainty exists with regard to the
exact date of Mammıța.''? According to Dr. De “Mammața
probably belongs to the period between the middle of the 11th and
the first quarter of the 12th century.", I am here concerned
with Dr. De's remarks about the lower limit for Mammața's date,
which read as follow's :-
“The lower limit of Mammața's date, however, may be fixed
with reference to two commentaries on the Kavyaprakāśa of which
the dates can be ascertained. The commentary of Manikyacandra
is expressly dated in Samvat 1216 = 1160 A, D. The exact date of
Ruyyaka's commentary is not known, but we know from other
sources that Ruyyaka flourished in the second and third quarters of
the 12th century. Mammață, therefore, cannot be placed later than
the beginning of the 12th century.”
According to tl.e above view we can fix say about A.D. 1115 as
the lower limit for Mammața's date.
According to Mr. P. V. Kanes "the Kavyaprakāśa was compos.
ed at all events before 1150 A. C., so the date of the Kāryaprakāśa
lies between 1050 and 1150 A. C. and is most probably 1100 A. C.”
Prof. Keith also assigns the Kāvyaprakāśa to "about 1160."

was composed in Sanivat 1216 (A. D. 1159-60) and a Ms of it is dated

MAMMATA AND HEMACANDRA

It would thus be seen that the lower limit for the Kāvg'a-
prakāśa as fixed by scholars is about A. D. 1100.
I propose in this paper to draw the attention of scholars to the
following mention of Mammața by the celebrated Hemacandra in
his work called the Kävyānuśásana. Hemacandra composed two
commentaries on this work called the Alanikāracüdāmaņi and the
Viveka and both of these commentaries along with the text have
been recently published.' Prof. Athavale in his English Notes to
this excellent edition of the Kävyānuśājana states :-"Our author
(Hemacandra) has faithfully followed 37/aizava and AIAT and
advanced the stock arguments used by these two authors in defence
of 4771."'? These remarks led me to search for any mention of
Mammața by name in Hemacandra's present work. The list of
references to earlier authorities mentioned in the Kāryānušāsana
as furnished by the learned editors helped me to locate the only
mention of Mammața and a verse of his quoted by Hemacandra.
This verse reads as follows:
"GYIK AIRI: 1
भगूढमपरस्याङ्गं वास्यसियामस्फुटम् ।
संदिग्धतुल्यप्राधान्ये काकाक्षिप्तमसुन्दरम् ।
व्यायमेवंगुणीभूतध्यङ्गयस्याष्टी भिदाः स्मृताः ॥ इति ॥"
The above verses are identical with Kārikās 45-46 of Ullāsa V
of the Kāvyaprakāśa of Mammaţa.
The above mention of Mammața and a quotation of his Kārikās
have a direct bearing on the date of the Kāvyaprakāśa.
Dr. Bühler tried to assign approximate dates to the several
1. Kävyānusāsana by R. C. Parikh and R. B. Athavale,
published by Sri Mahavira Jaina Vidyalaya, Bombay, Vols. I and II
1938. Vol. I contains Text and Indices and Vol. II contains an
claborate Introduction in English. Prof. A. B. Dhruva in his
Foreword to Vol. I (p. 11) states that "Hemacandra first composed
the Sūtras and gave them the title of TOGETTHAT and to them he added
an explanatory vrtti which he called alamkāracūdāmaņi and the two
together were intended to be Šāstra of #167 (Flagrat148)". "Viveka
is a commentary on #732 TJETTAT."

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
works composed by Hemacandra. Mr. R. C. Parikh' regards these
dates as “on the whole correct." In tre opinion of Dr. Bühler the
Kõvyaprakāśa was probably written “in the beginning of the rule of
Kumarapala.”. The dates for the beginning and end of Kumāra-
pāla's reign are A.D. 114. and 1174 respectively.? Presuming there-
fore, that Dr. Brihler's statement is correct we shall not be wrong
in assigning tlie Kāryānuśūsena to the first decade of Kumārapāla's
reign i.e. belueen A. D. 1.43 and 1153 so that l'emacandra's
mention of Mammața turns out to be the carliest one so far record-
ed in view of the fact that Mānikyacandra's commentary on
Mammata's Kāvyaprukāśa is dated 1160 A. D.“ and that tle exact
date of Ruyyaka's commentary is not known though he is said to
belong to the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the 12th century.5
Hemacandra's indebtedness to Manimața has already been
pointed out by Dr. S. K. De but his accusation of Hemacandra as
one who "appropriates without acknowledgment'' is rather barsii, if not
a biased one, as we cannot apply our modern standards of criticisin
with all their rigidity to works written 800 years ago. I have not
examined Dr. De's charge of plagiarism without acknowledgment
against Hemacandra with regard to the works of Rajasekhara and
others but so far as Mammața is concerned, Hemacandra stands
acquitted as he expressly mentions Mammața and then quotes from
him TIE RIAZ:... ... ... sfa' as we have seen above.

Page 69****************************************************************************************
STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The above conspectus of the dates pertaining to Hemacandra
and Mammața tends to show that the latter part of Mammaţa's life
may have been synchronous with the early literary activity
of Hemacandra and that Mammața may have been a senior contem.
porary of Hemacandra, who has freely drawn from the Kāvya-
prakāśa as pointed out by Dr. De. It may now be asked if these
contemporaries ever met each other at any time in their lives. This
question cannot be definitely answered at present though the
possibility of such a meeting having taken place cannot be ruled
out owing to the frequent intercourse and contact between Gujarat
and Kashmir in Ilemacandra's time.'
1. This literary intercourse between Gujarat and Kashmir is
proved by the fact that the earliest dated MS (A. D. 1158) of the
Kävyaprakāśa of the Kashmirian Nainmața is found at Jesalmere and
the earliest commentary on the same work of A. D. 1160 was com-
posed by Manikyacandra in Gujarat. According to the Prabhāvaka.
Caritra written about A. D. 1250 by Prabhacandra and Pradyumna.
sūri, Heinacandra comsosed his Grammar with the help of MSS
brought from the library of the temple of Sarasvati in Kashmir.
Though this may be an exaggeration as suggested hy Dr. Bühler,
Hemacandra must have made use of some MSS from Kashmir in
view of Merutunga's statement in his Prabandha-Cintāmaņi (A. D.
1305-6) that Jayasimha managed to gather grammars from various
lands for the use of Hemacandra (Vide p. 17 of Life of Hemacandra
by Dr. Bühler, trans. lvy Dr. Manilal Patel, Singhi Jain Series, edited
by Muni Jinavijaya, 19:6). About the possibility of Hemacandra's
teachers being Kashmirian Panditas, the sojourn of the Kashmirian
Bilhaņa to Anahillapura and the presence of the Kashmirian gram-

5. The Oldest Cated Manuscript of the
Deśīnāmamālā of Hemacandra,
Dated September 1241 A.D.*
The Dešinamamālā of Hemacandra wish lis cun commertas y
was based on the Prākrit dictionary written by Dhanapāla in
A.D. 972'. Dr. Bühler discovered this work and published a coure
of it from the only MS then in his possession. Pisciel edited this
work in the Bombay Sanskrit Series (No. XVII, 1880). This edition
was based on 9 MSS designated by him as A, B, C, D), E, F,G,H,I.
I am concerned in this note with the dated MSS of the work used
by Pischel. These are described by him in his Introduction to the
Bombay Edition. They are as follows :-
(1) A-Sanicat 1549 (Bikaner MS) = A.D. 1493.
(21 C--Samrat 1587 (Ahmedabad J1S) = A.1), 1:31.4
(3) E-Sarivat (i) 15.5 (Ahmedabad MS; = 1519 (,5
(4) H-Sanoat 1628 (Ahmedabad NS) = A.D. 1572.
Pischel states that “In order to ascertain the correct reading''
he was very often obliged to have recourse to etymology." Where
etymology failed him he had “nothing to guide him but the best
Mis" which, however, “was by no means trustwortly." Pischel's
first edition has been revised by Principal P. V. Ramanujaswami
and published by ile B. O R. Institute, Poona. For this cdition

the editor states that he had seven MSS at his disposal out of which
one was a recent copy while three were already made use of for the
first edition. The remaining three MSS (designated X, Y, Z) were
utilized by him for the second edition (1938). Out of these three
MSS only MS Y is a dated copy prepared in Sauvat 1636 in the
month of Plaguna ( = February-March 1580).
Principal Ramanujaswami regards the text of the Dešinamamālā
as “settled with considerable purity” and hence he has allowed
the text to remain as it stood in the first edition."
In spite of tlie efforts of the two editors of the Desīnāmamālā
to settle its text the discovery and use of other MSS of the work
earlier in point of date will make the assurance regarding "con-
siderable purity of the text doubly sure and it is the purpose of
this note to point out such MSS as are earlier than those used by
the two editors viz. Pischel and Ramanujaswami.
The India office MS? of the work is a copy written in A.D.1881
and is useless for our present inquiry regarding VSS of the Desī.
nāmamālā copied earlier than A.1). 1493 which is llie date of tlie
Bikaner MS used by Pischel and which is the earliest dated MS
known to the two editors of this work. Prof. Velankar describes
three MSS3 of this work in the possession of the B. B. R. A.
Society, Bombay. Only one of these MSS is dated, having been
copied in Saka 1786 (= A.D. 1861). The MSS mentioned by
Aufrecht' have been already utilized by Pischel and Ramanuja-
swami. The Oriental MSS Library at Ujjain records a MS under
the title “Dešināmamālā (Anekārtha Sangraha)" by Hemacandra,
but it is not clear whether the MS is one of the Dešināmamālā or of
the Anekārthasangraha as the entry in the lists of Ujjain MSS is

rather ambiguous. This MS also does not bear any date. The Jain
Granthävali records one MS of the Deśīnāmamālā, one of a vrtti on
it called “Ratnāvalī" and a glossary called Uddhära by Vimala.'
None of these MSS is dated.
The foregoing survey of the dated MSS of the Desīnāmamāla
reveals to us the following chronology of the available copies of
the work :-
A.D 1493, 1519 (?), 1531, 1572, 1580, 1864, 1881.
I shall now record a MS of the Dešīnāmamālā which appears
to me the earliest dated MS of the work. It is deposited in the
Sanghavi Pādā Jain Bhandar of Patan and is described by the late
Mr. C. D. DALAL in his Descriptive Catalogue of MSS in the Jain
Bhandars at Pattan. According to Mr. DALAL's description the
MS consists of 119 leaves and is 10" x 13" in size. It was copied
by a man of the Kāyastha caste in Sainvat 1298, (asvina sudi 10
ravau) = Sunday, 15th September 12.11. Tlie colophon mentions a kins
of the name "ACT"* tiara 52 T'' who appears to me to be identical
with the Caulukya king of the same name who became king at Ana-
hilapāțaka in Vikrama Sanivat 1300 ( = A.D. 1244) according to Thera-
vali.' Jayantasiha mentioned in the colophon as the son of Tejapāla
is the writer of the MS. This Tejapāla may perhaps be identical
with his namesake who was one of the two great ministers of the
father of Visaladeva. These two ministers suffered great indignities
at the hands of Visaladeva and were replaced by a Brahmin nained
Nāgada as the chief minister. The Jain Bhandars contain three
other MSS written during the reign of king Visaladeva' in A.1).1239,

view of these facts the value of this MS for textual purposes should
be the greatest as Pischel found that even the best MS used by him
was not at times trustworthy in constituting the text of the Dešināma-

procure a photographic copy of this MS from the authorities of the

Mr. Dalal states that he had complete access to these MSS and that
he discovered many new and important Sanskrit and Prākrit works,
both Jain and Brahmanical supposed to have been unknown or lost
hitherto. He also discovered an enormous bulk of Arabhramba litera-
ture, which is looked upon as the immediate source of many Indian

ring to the work of his guru Hemacandra as also to his own works',
which he had composed earlier viz. Nalavilāsa and others. These
references give us the necessary chronological data for fixing the
earlier terminus to the date of the Natyadarpana, the later terminus
being of course A. D. 1175 as stated by the editors of the Națya.
darpaşa in giving us the life-period of Rāmacandra.
According to Bühler? Hemacandra's “Grammar must have been
ready at the earliest towards the end of Vikrama year 1197-A. D.
1141.” The editor of the Kavyānusāsana, Mr. Parikh' also
observes :-"We may place the completion of the grammar at the
earliest, towards the end of Vikrama year 1185-A. D. 1139." In
view of this date for Hemacandra's grammar which is described as
"सिद्धहेमचंद्राभिधानशब्दानुशासन' in the Raghuvilāsa of the author of the
Natyadarpana we are justified in regarding A. D. 1140 as the earlier
terminus to the date of Națyadarpaņa which mentions and quotes
from the Raghuvilāsa several times as we have seen above. We,
therefore, get the following chronological series with reference to
the Nāțyadarpana :-

the order in which he wrote his works, though he nowhere gives

. In recording the above series I have necessarily presumedan
interval of about 5 years on either side of the work, Raghuvilāsa, 1.0
that we may safely fix A. D. 11:0 as the earlier terminus for the
date of the Nāțyadarpana, which appears to me to be the product
of Rāmacandra's mature genius. In fact Rāmacandra refers to many
of his earlier works' which number no less than eleven and which
show that Rāmacandra was not only a critic but a poet and dramatist
as well at the time wlien le composed this work on dramaturgy and
its commentary called the Națyadarfaņarivșiti, towirds ile close of

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Rāmacandra composed his comnieniany alegarofagigt after the
completion of Hemacandra's Pramanamimāṁsā (between A.D. 1160
and 1173) that is to say after A.D. 1160 and before A.D. 1173. If the
Näțyadarpan, and its Vivrtti may be supposed to have been
composed in close succession we shall have to assign both these
works to the period A. D. 1160-1173. However, as the date stands
at present I am inclined to assign the following limits to the
chronology of the text and the commentary :-
(1) Natyadarpaņa-composed between A.D. 1150 and 1170.
(2) Națyadarparavivștti- composed between A. D. 1160
and 1170.
The later limit of A. D. 1170 indicated by me above for both
the works is based on the following evidence :-
(1) King Ajayapāla' who killed Rāmacandra by torture ruled
between A. D. 1173 and 1176.
(2) The story of the above torture is recorded by Merutunga
in his Prabandhacintamani composed in 1305 A. D. (Samvat 1361)
(Vide pp. 37–39 of Intro. to Nalavilāsa).
(3) Ramacandra was living in A. D. 1173, when his guru
Hemacandra died, and when Rāmacandra consoled King Kumāra-
påla according to the Kumārapālacarita composed in A. D. 1366
by Jayasimhasūri (vide p. 37 of Intro. to Nalazilāsa, G. O. S.
Baroda, 1926).
(4) As Kumārapāla's reign is assigned to the period A. D. 1144-
1173' and Ajayapāla's reign to the period A. D. 1173-1176, we must
presume that Rāmacandra, the author of the Nāțyadarpaņa must
have met his death after the death of He macandra’ and also that of
Kumārapāla in A. D. 1173. At any rate Rāmacandra could not
have composed any works after A. D. 1173 if we believe in
Merutunga's account of the hatred of Kumārapāla's successor

Ray, Calcutta, Vol. II (1936).
2. Vide p. CCXIC of Parikh's Intro, to Käv. According to the
Pra. Cha. Hemacandrà died in the year V. S. 1229 = A. D. 1173 at
the ripe old age of 84 years a short time before Kumarapāla died.

states :- "Hemacandra had a group of disciples who were very learned
and who helped him in his work. Of these Rāmacandra deserves
special mention. He is reported to be the author of a hundred Pra.
bandhas, that is, compositions. Some of his plays are published; they
are good as literature and show considerable skill in the technique
of play.writing. His Natyadar para a work on dramaturgy has been
published in the G. O. S. It throws some new light on the history of
Sanskrit drama. His Kumāra-vihāra-śataka is a fine piece of
description and gives an idea of what big temples were in those days,
The poem should be studied very carefully by every student of
Gujarat architecture and art."

7. Identification of Kutulakhāna Mentioned by
Jinaprabhasūri in his Vividha-Tīrtha-Kalpa ?
Dr. B. C. Law in his "Studies in the Vividha-Tirtha-Kalpa"
recently published in the Jaina Antiquary' states that this Jain work?
is important and helpful in the study of ancient Indian Geography
as some of the materials recorded in it are new and interesting.
I find on a perusal of this work that this work contains some
historical data also, which need to be properly exploited and
corroborated from all sources possible, contemporary or otherwise.
For this purpose, we must know the life-history of its author
Jinaprabhasūri and hence we are giving below a chronological
survey of the events connected with the life of Jinaprablia and his
contemporaries :-

vijayaji, Singhi Jaina Granthamālā No. 10, Shantiniketan (Bengal),
1934. The Editor informs us in the Introduction that this work is
important for History as well as for Geography. It is a sort of Guide
Book to different tirthas as existing in the 14th Century. Jinaprabha-
sūri was greatly honoured by Tughlak Sultan Mahammad Shah in
the same manner in which Hiravijay asûri was later honoured by
Emperor Akbar in the 16th Century. Dealing with the date of com-
position of this work the Editor states that it must have required
about 30 years for its composition, because the earliest date recorded
in it is Samvat 1364 = A.D. 1318 while the latest date is Samvat
1389 = A. D. 1333.- The dated Mss. of this work used by the Editor
are as follows :-A.--Samvat 1466 = A. D. 1410; B.--about 400 years
old ; C.-about 400 years old; D.-17th Century; Pa. Samvat 1527 =

giri it may be reasonable to conclude that his contact with that
place lasted upto at least A. D. 133? when he was honoured by
Muhammad Taghlaq as stated by him in his Vividhatirtha-Kalpa
(No. 51) in which he mentions one Kutulakl än (ETBET) as the
officer in charge of Daulatābād (37agiC) as will be seen from the
following lines':--
"क्रमेण पत्तं सिरिदउलताबाद दीवाणे। भणियं च सविणय नगरनायगेग सिरिकुतुलखानेन
भट्टारयाण सिरिपातसाहि फुरमाणागमणं ढिल्लीपुरं पइ पत्थाणं चाइदं।"
This appears to be the only reference to steera by Jinaprabha-
sūri in the whole of the Vividhatirtha-Kalpa and as the editor has
not identified him it is necessary to investigate and prove the
identity of this historical personage on the strength of contem.
porary evidence.
I propose to identify go ara who is styled as cara
with reference to the capital of Daulatabad in Jinaprabhasűri's
work with QUTLUGH KHĂN about whom the following informa-
tion is given by Prof. N. V. Ramanavya
(1) He was recalled from his post on 8th December, 1344.*
(2) He was governor of the Maratha country and his depar-
ture from Devagir must have taken place about March
1345 A. D.'
(3) His brother's name was ". Ālim-ul-Mulk.“
1. My friend Prof. R. D. Laddu renders the above passage into
Sanskrit as follows :-
"क्रमेण प्राप्तं श्री दौलताबाददीवाने । भणितं च सविनयं नगरनायकेन श्री कुतुलखानेन
भट्टारकाणां श्रीपातसाहि फुरमानागमनं दिल्लीपुरं प्रति प्रस्थानं च आदिष्टम्" ।
2. Prof. H. D. Velankar records the following information
about this work in the press.coppy of his Jinaratnakośa (p. 238):-
तीर्थकल्प also called कल्पप्रदीप containing legendary and historical
account of the different Jain holy places of pilgrimage, composed
between Samvat 1365-1399 (i. e. A. D. 1309-1334) by Jina prabha.

IDFNTIFICATION OF KUTULAKHXNA
(4) According to Isamy lie led a successful expedi-
tion against the army of Nusrat Klän in Bidar and that
he defeated Ali Shah at Dhārur.'
(5) His son Alap Klian led an expedition against Chandgadh.?
(6) The Sultan sent liis order to Qutlugh Khin for sending
the people from Devacic to Dehli."
The above information clearly shows that Qutlugh Khân was an
important personage and played a prominent part at the Sultan's
court at Daulatavad though he was recalled from the place
in A.D. 1314. In tlie details about this governor of Devagiri
recorded by Prof. Ramanayya I have not been able to trace the date
of his appointment to the governorship of Devagiri butas
Jinaprabhasūri mentions him as a stare in A. D. 1332 it
would be reasonable to suppose that he must have been
appointed to that office some years earlier. It is, however, certain
that he acted in that important capacity at least from A. D. 1332 to
13+4, a period of 12 years. Ibn Battūtawho was born on 24th
February 1304 and wlo reached Indus on 12th September 1333 and
later reached the Sultan's capital Diulicabad refers to our gacara
in the following lines :-"At Daulat Abād resides the great Khān
Qutlu Khân, the Sultan's tutor, who is governor of the town and
the Sultan's representative there and in the lands of Sāghar,
Tiling (Telingāna) and their dependent territories. This province
extends for three months' march, is well populated and wholly
under his authority and that of his lieutenants.”'
It appears to nie that Kutula Klin mentioned by Jinaprabha-
sūri, Qutli Khan mentioned by Battūta and Qutlugh Khăn men-
tioned by Isāmy and others are identical. If this identity is
accepted it would be possible to suggest that Jinaprabha may have
heard about Battuta wl.o reached India about a year after
Muhammad "Tagl.lakh's meeting with Jinaprablia in July
1332. Though it is easy to imagine a personal contact of
Qutlugh Khān with Jinaprabhla in A. D. 1392 and with
Battūta after A. D. 1333 it is difficult to prove any
direct contact between Jinaprabha and Battūta unless any
documentary evidence on this point is discovered by scholars like
Prof. Ramanayya ard oilers, who liave made a close study of the
history of Mubainmad Taghlakli's reign. I shall also be happy to
learn from Jain salolais any historical facts about the biography of
Jinaprabhasűri especially after A. D. 1332.

8. Date of Nāțakalakṣaṇaratnakośa of
Sāgaranandin-Before A.D. 1431 1
Prof. Myles Dillon in his preface to the edition of the Nāțaka.
laksanaratnakośa' of Sāgaranandin states that this work was
discovered by Prof. Sylvain Lévi during his visit to Nepal in 1922
and reported by him in the Journal Asiatique xciii, p. 210 (1933).
In examining the question of the chronology of this work
Prof. Dillon observes :-
"He (Prof. Lcvi) pointed out that the text is quoled by Rāya-
mukuta in a commentary on tlie Amarakośa written a.d. 1431 which
would give an inferior date but it has not becn possible to verify
this as I have been unable to discover a complete edition of the
commentary.” ?

Dr. V. Raghavan of Madras appears to be unaware of it in 1933 when
he made the following remarks in the Annals of the Phandarkar
Institute, Vol. XIV (1933), p. 260:-“On page 325 of his Poetics, Vol. I

as having been noticed by dufrecht. There is every likeliliood of this
Nāțakaratnakośa being only that section of the Samgilarāja deal-
ing with Drama proper, the Dasarūpaka and the Uparūpaka
scheme, Itivịtta, Sam:lhi etc. The sections on Rasa ,and Nāțaka,
these two being widely read parts of the Nāțyaśāstra and connected
more than the other sections to Alamkāra also perhaps got separated
into independent works, as the existence of a separate Ms of the
Rasaratnakośa and the citations of these sections with the mere
chapter-name show." Dr. Raghavan further observes in the footnote
to the above extract:--"From these Ratnakośas that are sections of
the Samgitarāja inust be distinguished the lexicon Ratnakośa which
is quoted in commentaries on Amara. The lexicon Ratnakośa is very
much earlier to the Samgitarāja."

Perhaps Prof. Lévi's statement may have been based on the
following entry in Aufreclit's Cata. Catalogorum' :--:
"ITETE77at quoted by Rāyamukuta and Bhānuji Qxf. 182 62"
In the above entry the fact of Rāyamukuta's quotation from and
mention of the Nāțakaratnakośa, if verified and identified in the
text of the Nățakalakṣaṇaratnakośa now made available on the basis
of the Nepal Ms. will have the highest chronological value. As
however, Prof. Dillon has not been able to verify the above refer-
ence I propose to attempt such verification in this paper.
The Padārthacandrikā' of Bịhaspati surnamed Rayamukuța-
maņi and generally known as Rāyamukuta was composed in A. D.
1431. It is based on sixteen earlier commentaries on the Amara-
kośa. The author was a native of Rādlā in Bengal. He was the
son of Govinda and father of Visrāma, Rāma and others. Aufrecht
has already recorded a list of authorities quoted by Rāyamukuta
numbering about 270.
As neither a complete edition of Rāyamukuta's commentary
nor the list of authorities published by Aufrecht was available to
me I had to avail myself of a good copys of the work available in
the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. On
folio 966 of this copy I found the following passage :-
1. Vol. I, p. 284.
2. Cata. of Bod. Library, Oxford, 1864, by Aufrecht, p. 182-
Here a Ms of a commentary of Bhānuji Dikşita on the Amarakoša
has been described. In the list of authorities mentioned by Bhanuji
NIZATMIST has been mentioned. Dr. Belvalkar assigns Bhattoji
Dikşita to “about 1630 A. D.” (Systems of Sans. Grammar, p. 47).
Bhānuji, also called Rāmāśrami, was the son of Bhattoji Dikşita.

Now compare the following extract from Prof. Dillon's edition
of the Napakalakṣaṇaratnakośa with the above extract:-
Page 108–
" अथ शालंकारः कथ्यते
लीला विलासो विच्छितिर्विभ्रमः किल किश्चितम् ।
मोहायितं कुट्टमितं बिब्बोको ललितं तथा ॥
विकृतं चेति विज्ञेयाः स्त्रीणां भावाः स्वभावजाः।"
As Rayamukuta mentions "ना-करत्नकोष" as the source of his
quotation and as the quotation itself has been identified in Prof.
Dillon's edition of the Nāțakalakṣaṇaratnakośa we can easily
conclude that नाटकरत्नकोश is identical with नाटकलक्षणरत्नकोश.' As
Sāgaranandin has drawn largely on Bharata's Natyaśāstra and as
1. The correct title of the work appears to be 7779.394OTTEHTOFTET of
which नाटकरत्नकोश is evidently an abbreviated form. At the begin-
ning of the work the author remarks "नारकलक्षणं दशरूपक ......वक्ष्यामः"
(lines 6 7). In the following extract from the end of the work the
word 71275370T has been emphasized and the colophon gives us the
title नाटकलक्षणरत्नकाश-Page 134 (Jines 3217-3230)-

DATE OF NATAKALAKŞAŅARATNAKOŚA OF:SÅGARANANDIN
51
Prof. Dillon has obliged us by giving us an exhaustive index of
quotations from the Națyaśāstra we are in a position to see that the
three lines quoted by Rāyamukuța in A. D. 1431 as from 77722712T
are found almost identical with the following lines found in chapter
XXIV of the Nātyaśāstra' called "Araratata" :-
"लीला विलासो विच्छित्तिर्विक्रमः किलकिञ्चितम् ।
मोटायितं कुहमितं बिश्वोको ललितं तथा ॥ .२॥
विहृतं घेति विजया दश स्त्रीणां स्वभावजाः।"
Though the above quotation from the Natyaśāstra is identical
with that in Dillon's text of the Nāțakalakṣaṇaratnakośa we must
presume that Rāyamukuța has quoted from the Națakaratnakośa of
Sāgaranandin and not from the Nāțyaśāstra, as he mentions his
source by name. It would be, therefore, reasonable to conclude that
the work of Sāgaranandin was available to him. This inference
enables us to state definitely that the date of the Națakalaksana-
ratnakośa is earlier than A. D. 1431. We may even go a little further
and conclude that it may have been composed before the latter half of
the 14th century, presuming that a work to be quoied as authority by
a writer of Rāyamukuta’s learning and critical ability must have
taken more than 50/60 years to attain the necessary celebrity and
authority.
We have already recorded above that a work called arca7i21
has been quoted by Bliānuji Dikşita in his commentary on the
Amarakośa as stated by Aufrecht in his description of an Oxford
Ms of the commentary. I find this quotation in a printed edition?
of this commentary as follows :-
" लीला विलासो विच्छिसिर्विभ्रमः किल किश्चितम् ।
मोटायितं कुट्टिमितं विश्वोको ललितं तथा ॥
विहतं चेति मन्तव्या दश स्त्रीणां स्वभावजाः
gfa art .

The first two lines of the above quotation are identical with the
first two lines of Rāyamukuta's quotation from the Näțakaratnakosa
but the difference in the 3rd line will be clear from their comparison
as follows:--

"farena afa fast stort aut: FTHTH: "
c. 1630 A. D.-Bhanuji Dikṣita-
“faec ara H*TOUT , afort Fahre91: 1"
As Bhānuji Dikṣita is a later commentator on the Amarakoša
the possibility of his copying in toto an earlier quotation in Rāyamu-
kuța's commentary on the same work will have to be disproved
before any importance is attached to Bhānuji's quotation from the
Națakaratnakośa. I am of opinion that the difference in the 3rd
line of the quotation as is revealed in the above comparison is so
marked that we can safely presume the existence of a Ms of the
Nāțakaratnakośa from which Bhānuji has taken the quotation in
question. This Ms obviously shows a different version of the text
if we can judge from the variations noticeable in a single line as
pointed out in the above comparison of the versions of the same line
as found in Rāyamukuța's quotation and in Bhānuji's quotation.
Let us now consider the date of Bhānuji Dikşita. Dr. Belval-
kar assigns his father Bhattoji to about 16.30 A. D.' Dr. Saletore,
however, assigns him to the “last quarter of the sixteenth and the
first quarter of the seventeenth century A.D.''2 If this date is correct
we shall have to presume that Bhattoji flourished say between A. D.

"Jagannātha, the Court Pandit of Emperor Shahajahan, informs us in
his Praudhamanoramākucamardini that Bhattoji was the pupil of
Beşa-Kșşņa, to whose memory he does very scant justice in his
Praudhamanoramă. As Jagannātha himself was the pupil of the son of
this Sesa-Kțşņa, this gives us Bhațţoji's date which must be about
A. D. 1630. This is also confirmed by the fact that a pupil of
Bhațgoji wrote a work in Samvat 1693 ( = A. D. 1637).”
2. Vide p. 98 of Karnataka Historical Review, Vol. IV, 1937
(Jan.-July) Nos. 1 and 2-Dr. Saletore's evidence may be briefiy
indicated here. Bhațgoji in the opening verses of his 779#TETH states
that he wrote the work at the order of Keladi Venkațendra, who is
identified by Dr. Saletore with king Venkațapa Nãyak I (1582-1629
A. D.). This king was noted for his patronage to learned men and

1575 and 1625. Prof. Kane' assigns Bhattoji to the period "about
1575-1650 A. D." in one place while in another place he assigns
him to a period “ 1560-1620 A. D."-a date which agrees with Dr.
Saletore's date for Bhattoji mentioned above. I am inclined to
accept for the present Dr. Saletore's view about Bhattoji's date and
assign Bhānuji Dikșita' (the son of Bhattoji) to about 1630 A. D.
In view of the above date for Bhānuji Dikşita, 'about 1630 A.D.'
would be one of the later limits for the date of the Nāțakaratnakośa.
Prof. Dillon states ( Preface p. vii) that the Ratnakośa cited by
Rucipati in his commentary on the Anargharāghava appears to be
the text of the Nāțakalakșanakośa edited by him and that Ranga-
nātha in his commentary on the Vikramorvašīya cites Sāgara
regularly by name and quotes the text (vide pp. 90–96, foot-notes
of Dillon's Edition). Though Rucipati's date is uncertain, observes
Prof. Dillon, the Ms from which the commentary is edited in
Kāvyamālā 5 was written in A. D. 1613. He, therefore, puts
A. D. 1613 as the later limit for Sāgara's date.“
As we have, however, identified the reference to the Nataka-
ratnakośa mentioned by Rāyamukuța in the Dillon's edition of the
Nățakalakşanaratnakośa, the later limit for Sāgara' date is a.d. 1431
definitely
We have already referred to Dr. Rāghavan's view regarding the
nature and contents of the Natakaratnakosa. According to this
view the work may have been originally a part of the Samgitarāja

DATE OF 'NATAKALAKŞA NARATNAKOŚA OF SXGARANANDIN
: 35
We have fixed A.D. 1431 as one terminus to the date of the
Națakalakṣaṇaratnakośa. As regards the other terminus we quote
Prof. Dillon's remarks :- "The Viddhaśālabhañjikā of Rājasekhara
which is cited at 1. 3071 dates from the tenth century (see Konow :
Das Indische Drama, p. 84). If the Dūtāngada cited at 1.983 is the
play of Subhata, which there is no reason to doubt, the superior
date is A.D. 1243 (see Grey J. Am. Or. Soc. 32, 39) but the identity
is not certain as there are no quotations. The Rāmābhyudaya
quoted is not that of Rāmadeva (fifteenth century), which has been
edited by Losch, Das Indische schattenheater, p. 80 for none of the
quotations are to be found in that text. The Ratnakosa may be as
early as the thirteenth century but I cannot now put forward any
more exact date as the author Sāgaranandin is not known except in
connection with this work (Lévi. Jour. Asiatique xciii, p. 211)."
In the above remarks Prof. Dillon refers to the work Rāmā.
bhyudaya mentioned and quoted from' by Sāgaranandin. As
Rāmadeva's Rāmābhyudaya of the 15th century has been ruled out
by Prof. Dillon we must find other works of this name. Aufrecht
records a Ms of this work, which is in 30 Sargas but the authorship
is ascribed to one Venkatesa. The work of this name quoted by
Anandavardhana must also be taken into account. It is ascribed to
Yasovarman.' I may, however, record an inscriptional reference to

Råmåbhyudaya which appears to have been a Kāvya composed by a
poet of the name Nārāyaṇa. The inscription in which this reference
is found hails from the Central Provinces. The verse' containing
the name of the work and the name of the poet reads as follows :-
"stareATOT/5H( SJ )qqalaaltigu: gefa:
श्रीरामाभ्युदयाभिधं रसमयं काव्यं स तयो व्यधात् ।
स्मृत्यारूढयदीयवाक्यरचना प्रादुर्भवनिर्भर-
प्रेमोल्लासितचित्रवृत्तिरभवद्वाग्देवतावल्लकी ॥"
The bearing of this verse on the date of the Națakalaksaņa-
ratnakosa will have to be studied at some length and hence must be
left to a future study.
1. This verse was kindly supplied to me by Prof. V. V. Mirashi of
Nagpur in a private communication dated 27th July 1937, inquiring
if I could trace a reference to this Kävya. I have pointed out to him
the available references to the Ramäbhyudaya. Perhaps Prof.
Mirashi may be able to throw some light on this Rāmābhyudaya of
Nārāyaṇa different from the works of the same name, by Venkatesa,
Ya śovarman, and Ramadeva.
2. Since my paper was sent to the press, I have received the
following information from my friend Prof. V. V. Mirashi in a letter
dated 13th September 1938:-The "verse which refers to a Rāmā.
bhyudaya-Kavya by the Poet Nārāyaṇa occurs in a stone inscription
found at Pujāripāli, a village 22 miles north by east from Sarangarh
the chief town of a feudatory state of the same name in the Eastern
States Agency. It is now deposited in the Rajpur Museum. The
inscription is undated but the prince Gopāladeva mentioned in it is
identified by some with his name-sake, an inscription of whose reign
has been found at Boram deva in the State of Kawardhă dated in the
Kalachuri year 840 (A. D. 1088-9). I am not inclined to accept the
identification as in my opinion the Pujāripāli inscription belongs to
a slightly later date i.e. to the twelfth or thirteenth century A. D.”
I am thankful to Prof. Mirashi for the above information. If we
succeed in connecting the Rāmabhyudaya Kavya of the above
inscription with the Rāmābhyudaya quoted by Sagaranandin, perhaps
we may be able to assign the date of his Națakalakşanaratnakośa to
the 13th century or rather the period between A. D. 1250 and 1350
but as the evidence stands at present this conclusion remains only
a probability.

Sridharasena, presuming that he is identical with the author of
the Visvalocana or Viśvalocanakośa.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Ranganātha's commentary on the Vikramorvašīya' referred to
above was composed in the Vikrama year 1712, i.e., A.D. 1656; and,
as Ranganātha quotes Visvalocana, we have in this work another
dated reference to Visvalocana, though it is later by thirty-two
years than the reference in the Dharuratnākara composed in
A. D. 1624. These references prove that the lexicon favore must
have been composed earlier than about A. D. 1550.
• Peterson in his Fifth Report (1896) gives an extract from a Mo
of Visvalocanakośa preserved at Anhilwad Patan (page 162, Paper
Ms. No. 5); while in his Index to authors in the same Report
(p. lxxv) he states about Sridhara that he was "the son of Munisena
of the Senānvaya”, and that the “Visvalocanakośa is apparently
ascribed to a pupil of his. 5, 162.”
The Jain Granthavali? mentions Visvalocanakosa and refers to
the very Ms mentioned by Peterson in his Fifth Report referred
to above, but mentions 'fertat' as the author of the lexicon stating
thereby that the author is of the Digambara Sect and not of the
Svetāmbara Sect.
Prof. Handiquid states that Jinarāja, commentator on the
Naişadhacarita, quotes under XVI, 20, a lexicographer named Sri-
dhara. According to Prof. Handiqui Jinarāja lived about A. D.
1650. Now the quotations from Sridhara referred to by Prof.
Handiqui is as under :-
"Trot: Ariales q017Tofaa gfa sfrut;"
This quotation is almost identical with the following line from the
published edition of Sridharasena's Visvalocanakośa:-

This quotation, therefore, furnishes us with another dated refer.
ence to the Visvalocanakośa of Sridharasena.
Prof. Handiqui further observes about Sridhara thus :-
"Sridhara is quoted in the Puruşakāra Commentary on the
Daivam. The Puruşakāra has been assigned to the 13th century."
(See Intro. to Trivandrum edn.)
The quotations from Sridhara referred to by Prof. Handiqui
are as follows:
Page 66 :-
"तथा च श्रीधरो नृत्यागेन नृत्यादीन् पठित्वा एसाम्सप्त धयित्वा इस्याह"
Page 16 :-
"श्रीधरस्तु 'स्तृञ् छादने' दीर्घः स्तृञ् छादने हस्व इत्युभावप्युपन्यास्यत्"
The above quotations appear to be from some grammatical
work and not from the lexicon V'iśvalocana of Sridharasena. At
any rate these references have no chronological value for our
present inquiry, unless the identity of Sridharasena, the lexico-
grapher, with Sridhara the grammarian is proved on conclusive
grounds.
A commentator on the Saupadma grammar of the name Śri-
dharacakravartin' is known, but as we have not got the text of this
commentary before us, it is not possible for us to identify the
above quotations.
The editor of I isvalocanakośa,? Mr. Nandalal Sharma, ascribes
the authorship of the works ( ) Śrutāvatara, (2) Bhavisyadattacaritra
and (3) Nāgakumārakathā, to an author Sridhara, but remarks that as
he had no occasion to examine these works, he is unable to say any-
thing about their author. Out of these three works we have
examined a Ms of Bhavisyadattacaritra viz., No. 1199 of 1891-95
in the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O R. Institute, Poona (folios
49). The author of this work is mentioned as Vibudhasridhara, and
we have no evidence to prove his identity with Sridharasena, the
author of the lexicon Visvalocanakośa. This Ms was copied in the
year A. D. 1580 (Saṁvat 1636) at Ambāvatidurga during the reign
of Raja Bhagavantadāsa, who is called Mahārājādhiraja. Presumably

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
this Vibudhasridhara must have composed this work before about
A. D. 1525, if not earlier.
We have already fixed A. D. 1550 as one terminus to the date
of Sridharasena, and have seen that the references to his name.
sakes recorded above have been found insufficient to furnish the
other terminus.
Before proceeding to note the internal evidence on the ques-
tion of our inquiry, it may not be out of place to record some
negative evidence having some bearing on the question of fixing
the earlier terminus for the date of the Viſvalocanakosa. We have
already seen above that Hemacandra in his Abhidhānacintāmani
does not refer to either the Visvalocanakośa or its author Sridhara-
sena. This omission may suggest that the Visvalocanakośa was
written after Hemacandra's time, viz., A. D. 1150.' Then, again,
another lexicon, viz. Visvaprakāśa or V'iśva of Maheśvara,? which
was composed in A. D. 1111, does not mention Sridharasena or his
Visvalocana in the list of earlier works utilized by him.
This omission may also suggest the probability that the Visua-
locanakośa was not known to Maheśvara in A. D. 1111. On the
contrary, there is ample evidence to prove that Sridharasena has
borrowed freely with slight variations from both Hemacandra and
Maheśvara, either directly or through Medinikośa' which criticizes
the V'iśvaprakāsakośa of Maheśvara in an adverse manner. With a
view to establish the indebtedness of Sridharasena to Hemacandra,
Maheśvara, and Medini, it would be useful to take some lines
which are found common to all the three lexicons with slight
variations :-

fa417 borrowed from Fráz is a matter for investigation, because
the possibility of a common source cannot be excluded in this case.
Hemacandra (A.D. 1088-1178) and the author of Visvaprakāša, viz.,
Maheśvara (A.D. 1111) were contemporaries; and the possibility of
one contemporary quite ignoring the work of another, even if it
were accessible to him, or of utilizing it in extenso, is equally
tenable. But in case it is definitely proved on independent
grounds that the fargareT has borrowed from Hemacandra's
Anekärthasamgraha we may infer that the reading frazia of the
Anekarthasaigraha has been changed to diapoit by the author of the
Visvaprakāśa; and a may have borrowed the line with this
change either from the Visvaprakāśa or the Medinikosa.
In support of this probable evidence we may compare another
line from the Visvalocana and its variations or otherwise as fourd

Medini, as also in the Visvalocanakośa of Sridharasena. It is,
however, difficult to establish on conclusive grounds whether Sri-
dharasena has borrowed from the Visvaprakasa or the Medinikosa.
Another argument in favour of the late chronology of Sri-
dharasena's lexicon is the following fact pointed out by Mr.
Nandalal Sharma in his Hindi Introduction to this lexicon :-
"There are may nânārthakošas in Sanskrit but so far as I am
aware there is no lexicon as comprehensive as or containing so.
numerous meanings of a single word as this lexicon ...... For instance,
the word 797 has four meanings in the Amarakoša, ten in the
Medini kośa, and tw:lve meanings in this lexicon.''!
The above remarks, if substantiated by many other analogous
examples may go to prove that Sridharasena composed his
lexicon after the Medinikośa, in which case the date of Sridhara-
sena's work will depend on that of the Medinikośa. If this line of
argument is accepted, we shall have to put Sridharasena between
the twelfth century and the sixtee, th century, because Prof.
Rāmāvatāra Sharınain this learned introduction to Kalpadrukosa
is inclined to push back Medini's date to the twelfth century. As
Medini refers to and criticizes the Visvaprakāśa (A.D.1111) and as he
is quoted in the Prşodarādivịtti of Padmanābhadatta in A. D. 1375,"
we may not be far wrong if we assign him to the thirteenth century,
and, accordingly,assign Sridharasena's Visvalocana to a date between
the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, or tentatively between
A.D. 1350 and A.D. 1550. These limits cannot be narrowed down in
the present stage of our inquiry for want of conclusive evidence.
Now, as regards the parentage of Sridharasena and the town
of his residence etc., we get some information in the praśasti" in his

10. The Genealogy of Mandana, the Jain Prime
Minister of Hoshang Ghori of Malwa-
Between A. D. 1405 and 1432 1
In a paper contributed by me to the Jaina Antiquary (Vol. XI,
No. 77, pp. 25-34) on “Maņdana, the Prime Minister of Malwa
and his Works”' I have assigned this Jain author to the period
A. D. 1400 to 1432 on the following grounds :-
(1) Mss of Mandana's works 77177054 and FlotAiza are dated
Samvat 1504 = A. D. 1448,"
अल्मसाहि or अलमसाहि, the patron of Mandana has been
identified by me with agar or Hoshang Ghori, who
ruled Malwa between A. D. 1405 and 1432 or so.
Since the above paper was sent for publication I have discover-
ed the following chronological evidence in support of my chrono-
logy for Mandana and his works :-
(1) Prof. H. D. Velankar in his francaist or Catalogus Catalo-
gorum of Jain Mss that is now being published by the
B. O. R. Institute, Poona, makes the following entry about
an author TTGT:
"79272 (arra, attira and 717) by 4775 ata, son of -
Chani. 69 ; PAPR. 18 (19); PAZB 1 (-8 ; 29-MS dated
Samvat 1504); 23 (8—MS dated Samvat 1504)."
It is evident from the above entry that MSS of the 7374 of
this author 967137 were copied in Samvat 1504 (= A. D. 1448) the
very year in which the MSS of Mandana's शुशारमण्डन and काव्यमण्डन
were copied. Let us now see if 75113 has any connection with
4779 the Prime Minister of Almsāhi of Malwa.
I have already pointed out in my paper on Maņdana that his
father anez was a Hegra connected with the agaatraat and that he

himself was a hafa like his father and a devout follower of Jain
religion as he calls himself "श्रीमद्वन्द्यजिनेन्द्रनिर्भरनतेः कव:. Mandana
further gives us the following information about his family:
(1)
AOT was his grand-father.
(2)
OT had six sons :-
(i) TTET, (ii) CIES,
(vi) TH787 (?).
(iii) tas, (iv) 90, (v) qrE+T
and
(3) 275 in the above list was Mandana's father. Unfortu-
nately Mandana does not record the names of his cousins,
the sons of चाहड, बाहड, देहड etc. This deficiency has,
however, been partially made up by the entry regarding
the शतकत्रय of धनदराज, son of देहड. I am inclined to
identify as, the father of Attra 977777, with Mandana's
uncle 3. The title jernia appears to have been held by
many members of the family as मण्डन calls himself संघपति.
He also calls his father संघश्वर (or संघपति). धनदराज was also a
संघपति and MSS of his शतकत्रय were copied at मण्डपदुर्ग in
A. D. 1448, the very year in which the MSS of Mandana's
works were copied.
धनदराज composed his शतकत्रय' at Mandapadurga or Mandu fort
in Samvat 1490 = A. D. 1434. This date confirms my chronology
for Mandana viz. A. D. 1405 to 1432, a period during which his
patron Hoshang Ghori ruled Malwa. Both these cousins Arsa and
TETTET were men of literary taste and ability and if one of them
composed a work in A. D. 1434 the chronology of the other cousin's
works may be safely assigned to the period, A. D. 1405--1432, as
determined by me already on the strength of probable evidence,
which now gets confirmed by the date of 99%TIT viz. A. D. 1434.
The genealogy of Mandana's family, may now be reconstructed
as follows :-

"मुमोच बंदीकृतमल्पषानमनरूपवीर्य बलवत्तरोयः ।

This confinement and release was carried out by Muzaffer,
Sultan of Gujarat (A. D. 1392–1410) sometime about A. D. 1409.
The poem Trafaaie was composed between A. D. 1458 and 1469
and consequently the use of the name SEHAT for Hoshang Ghori
is earlier than the use of the name 37etara recorded by Udayarāja.
The students of the history of Malwa should investigate and
determine the exact period of Mandana's Prime-ministership and
the influence exercised by this Jain Prime-minister on the policy
of Hoshang Ghori. This association of a Jain jufa with a
Muslim ruler of Malwa in the first half of the 15th century is as
interesting as it is instructive. Mandana refers to his Muslim
patron in glowing terms in his काव्यमण्डन and शंगारमण्डन, as also in his
सारस्वतमण्डन. The MS of Mandana's संगीतमण्डन is not available to
me and hence I am unable to say what information it contains
about its author and his Muslim patron.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
It appears to me that the MS of A. D. 1556 from which I have
quoted above is the earliest dated MS of Puñjarāja's Sārasvatatīka'
so far as I can judge from the published Catalogues available to
me for reference. The date of this copy viz., A. D. 1556 harmo-
nizes with the date assigned to Puñjarāja by Aufrecht and accepted
by other scholars viz., “A. D. 1475 to 1520." As Puñjarāja's uncle
Megha was patronized by a Muhammadan king of Malwa?
who flourished in A. D. 1475 we can definitely assign Puñjarāja

to a period between A. D. 1475 and 1520 and consequently the
B. O. R. I. MS of his work dated A. D. 1556 is not much removed
from the life-time of Punjarāja. The line of the Khalji rulers of
Malwa came to an end in A. D. 1531 when Nāsir's successor
Mahmûd Khalji was put to death. The kingdom of Malwa was
conquered by Humāyūn in A. D. 1535. We have no means of
determining the fate of Puñjarāja's family, say, after A. D. 1531.
The patronage to learning and the comparatively peaceful condition
of life enjoyed by the family of our author must have ceased after
the death of Mahmūd Khalji, the last Khalji ruler of Malwa.
Speaking of Puñjarāja Dr. Belvalkar' states that Puñjarāja "was
a minister to Ghaisuddin Khilji of Malwa 1469-1500. The state.
ment seems to be wrong because in the account of himself and his
ancestry given by Puñjarāja in the prašasti at the beginning of his
commentary on the Sarasvata we are only informed that Puñjarāja's
father Jivana and his uncle Megha got the title of fa from
Ghaisuddin Khilji (taifaa: E TIETOTETT 92 ofangata
937). We are also told that Puñjarāja became king (at) but
abandoned the kingdom to his younger brother Muñja (est...JATIE.
T1574101*7TT). Thus while he refers to his father Jivana and his
uncle Megha as ministers (e.g. " Haft") in v. 11, he styles himself
as “Eersi atoa:" in verses 13 and 23 of the prasasti. We must,
therefore, try to verify from contemporary history of Malwa the
exact significance of the title and applied by Puñjarāja to himself

whe contains of leaali Grant Annals
have been the contemporary of both these Kings. These Khaljis
were not only patrons of learning but they were men of some literary
taste. A work called Kankāli Grantha has been attributed to Nasir
Shah Khalji (Vide my paper in the Annals B. O. R. Institute, Vol.
XII, 289-291). Sardar G. N. Mujumdar has brought to light

a timc Mahmud resenting the insolence of Medini Rao, the all-power-
ful minister, tied to Guzerat. Bahadur Shah captured Malwa and
Mahmud and his family were made prisoners. Mahmud was later
put to death (in A.D. 1531). It remains to be seen if our Punja-
rāja became a during the rule of Medini Rao, i.e. say between
A. D. 1511 and 1526 or after A.D. 1531 when the Khalji dynasty of
Malwa came to an end. Humayun conquered Malwa in 1535.
Perhaps our Puñjarāja, the son of the ex-minister of the Khalji ruler,
may have declared independence between A. D. 1531 and 1526 as
this period was most opportune for this purpose. Medini Rao, the
powerful minister of Mahmúd Khalji between 1511 and 1526 A. D.
would not have tolerated our Puñjarāja styling himself as independ-
ent King (Vide p. 380 of Imperial Gazetteer, Vol. II, 1928.)

12. Exact Date of Amarakīrti, the Author of
a Commentary on the ķtusamhāra of Kālidāsa
- A. D. 1593 1
In my note' on "A commentary on the Rtusamhāra of Kālidasa
by Amarakirtisūri'' I drew the attention of scholars to the only
Ms of this commentary available in the Govt. Mse Library at the
B. 0. R. Institute, Poona, viz. No. 372 of 1887-91. I tried
also to fix the probable limits for the date of the author of this
commentary viz. 1550 and 1600 A. D. and tentatively assigned
Amarakirti to the 16th century.
The evidence for the limits of Amarakirti's date recorded by
me was more probable than direct but since my note was publish-
ed, I have come across the following evidence regarding Amara-
kirti's date which corroborates the limits fixed by me tentatively:-
In the Dictionary of Jain Biography the following entry has
been recorded regarding Amarakirti --
"Amarakīrti - Under him a Ms of Jinadatta's Vivekavilāsa was

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Samvat 1649 = A. D. 1592 (18th September) at Ahipura ( = modern
Nagpur) when Amarakirti was at the head of the Nägapura tapa-
gaccha during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.
The above particulars furnished by the Ms of the Vivekaviläsa
are quite definite as regards time and place of the copy in question.
We shall now try to identify Amarakirti mentioned in the colo-
phon of the Ms of the Vivekavilāsa with Amarakirti, the author
of the commentary on the Řtusamhāra, the only Ms of which is
available in the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute. The
B. O. R. I. Ms definitely ascribes the authorship of the com-
mentary to Amarakirti ("3787#ifálafarta (ar)ni...........razraat HOSTP
प्रथम एष नृपाभिरम्यः '') and this Amarakirti is further stated to be the
head of the Nāgapur tapogana ("angriTagi totalasi Tarina-
fae(featni maaari aai”). We are not aware of any other
Amarakirti acting as the liead of Nāgapura tapāgaccha between A. D).
1550 and 1600 and hence will be justified in identifying the author
of the commentary on the Řtusamhāra with his namesake under
whom the Ms of the Vivekavilāsa was copied at Nāgapur in Sam.
1649 i.e. A. D. 1592 during Akbar's reign' (A.D. 15:6-1605).
If our identification of the two Amarakirti-s is accepted, we
shall have to assign the author of the commentary on the Rtusa-
mhāra to the last quarter of the 16th century.
The Dictionary of Jain Biography mentions two other name-
sakes of Amarakīrii:(1) "A Dig. Bhattāraka, author of the Svayam.
bhu-Sahasranāma-Stotraţikā'' and (2) "the Author of a commen-
tary on Ratnasekharasūri's Sambodha-sitteri." I have not examined
the question of the chronology of these two authors and hence am
unable to say anything about it in the present note.
The third namesake of our Amarakirti not recorded by the
Dictionary of Jain Biography has been brought to our notice by
Prof. Hiralal? of Amraoti. He is distinct in all particulars of time
1. Akbar patronised the Jaina learned men. In A. D. 1582 he
placed Hiravijaya Sūri in the first division of the order of the Learned.
In 1592 he conferred the title of yuga pradhāna on Jinacandra Süri.
An inscription of Saṁvat 1651-52 (A. D. 1594-95) at Aṇhilavāda
Pāțaņa describes the interview between Akbar and Jinacandra Sūri
(See Dict. of Jain Biography pp. 37–38).

ceptors as recorded by Prof. Hiralal is as follows:-"अमितगति-शान्ति-

पटकमोपदेश in apabhramsa in "संवत् १२४७, भाद्रपद मास, द्वितीय (शुक्ल?) पक्ष,
१४ तिथि, गुरुवार" when कृष्णनरद्र son of वंदिग्गदेव of the Calukya dynasty
was reigning at Godhra in Gujarat. He wrote seven other work's
viz. (1) नेमिनाथ चरित्र, (2) महावीर चरित्र, (3) यशोधर चरित्र, (4) धर्मचरित्रटिप्पण,
(5) सुभाषितरत्नविधि, (6) धर्मोपदेशचूडामणि and (7) ध्यानप्रदीप. I have verified
the date of the CEPATOGET as recorded by the author and find that
it corresponds to Thursday, 16th August 1190.' It would thus be
seen that this namesake of our commentator flourished 4,0 years
carlier.

13. A Commentary on the Vāgbhațālamkāra
by Jñānapramodagaņi Composed in Jehangir's
Reign in A. D. 1625 (Samvat 1681)
No mention is made of a commentary on the Vägbhațālam-
kära of Vägbhata I by a Jain Commentator Jñānapramodagari either
by Dr. S. K. De in his Sanskrit Poetics or by Aufrecht in his
Catalogus Catalogorum. Only the Jain Granthāvali (1909) reſers
to a manuscript of this work in the Patan Bhandar (on p. 312) but
the date of composition recorded therein and indicated by the
remark “ TTT HETT 9839" is wrong. Perhaps "9839" is a misprint
for 1681 but this misprint is repeated in the Index of Dates given
at the end of the Jain Granthāvali and is left uncorrected in the
v1497 annexed to the volume.
The Govt. MSS Library at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute, Poona, possesses only one manuscript of this Vägbhață-
lanikāravrtti. It is No.798 of 1899-1915 and is included in the list
of MSS printed by this Institute in 1925. Though the folios of
the manuscript are serially numbered, the manuscript is incom-
plete, as on folio 1 the commentary on stanza 22 of the 2nd
Pariccheda begins. The colophon of the 2nd Pariccheda 18
recorded on folio 3 of the NIS reads as follows:-
"इति बृहत्खरतरगछे भट्टारकप्रभुश्रीजिनराजमृरिविजयिराज्ये श्रीसागरचंद्र-
सरिसंतानेपट्टानुक्रमसंजातरत्नधारगणिप्रवरविनेयवाचनाचार्यज्ञानप्रमोदगाणविनिर्मि-
तायां वाग्भटालंकारवृतौ द्वितीयः परिछेदः"
The MS consists of 78 folios and is uniformly written in a
legible manner, characteristic of the Jain scribes.
The colophon of the MS reads as follows on folios 77-78:-

A COMMENTARY :ON THE VAGBHATILA MKĀRA
79
• The chronogram "WTFTATT" in verse 18 of the above
colophon gives us Saívat 1681 (= A.D. 1625) as the date of
composition of this commentary by Jõānapramodagani as stated
in the verse. The expression "FIFTIT ESHAT:" presumably
refers to the reign of Emperor Jehangir, whose Christian name,
as we are given to understand, was Muhammad Sultan Salim.'
Then again the epithet "पातपाहिपुंगव" as applied to "सिलेमसाह" in
verse 20 definitely states his iinpierial descent and this statement
combined with the date of composition of the commentary viz.
A. D.1625 leaves no doubt that the reference to "apare in the
two verses 19 and 20 is definitely applicable to Emperor Jehangir
alone and not to Salem Shah, who was Emperor of Delhi between
A. D. 1545 and 15532 and who is stated to have honoured Candrakirti,
the Jain Commentator of the Sarasvataprakriyā of Anubhūtisvarūpā.
cārya. The above colophon also mentions one "
T T " or
"TATAE AFT". I am inclined to identify this King with Maharaja Gaja
Sings who was one of the distinguished officers employed by
Jehangir to hunt down Shah Jahan in May 1623 A. D. during the
latter's revolt against the former. We also know that this officer
of Jehangir was signally defeated in one of his encounters with
Shah Jahan's forces to such an extent that even his tent equipage
was seized by the enemy. Dr. Sudhindranath Bhattacharyya
describes this encounter in his learned article on "The Rebellion
of Shaha Jahan etc." as follows:---
“The need for wiping off the stain of this defeat was keenly
felt and tlie rebel prince now made a fresh effort to dislodge thie
Imperialists from their entrenchments. The fleet and the artillery
renewed their activities and the Rajput forces under Raja Gaj Singh
of Jodhapur were now vigorously attacked and reduced to great
straits. Raids upon the Imperialist Camp followed, in one of
which even the tent equipage of the Rajput Chief Gaj Singh was
seized and many of his followers slain. The turn of Sultan Pervez

800n came. His camp was also successfully attacked and some of
his personal effects including the bed-stead were carried away"-
(Beharistan 313--313h.)
As regards the identification of "CTFUTT'' mentioned in versc
19 of the colophon, I am inclined to identify it with "Lahore"
which was occasionally the seat of Jehangir's court and where
Jehangir arrived from Kaslımir on October 12, 1625 and stayed for
a few months before he set out for Kabul in March 1626.' The
name "mar" of the present MS colophon is phonetically nearer to
“Lahore” than other names for it recorded by Mr. N. L. Day viz.
agt, gaat, iat.?
Our commentator informs us in the last verse of the colophon
that the present NIS is the Target i.e. the first original MS of the
commentary, written by a scribe who is none other than one of his
pupils named JoricATiO. It appears to me, however, to be rather
a copy of this gehrgTİ than the TTATGET itself for the reason that
in spite of the missing portion of the commentary for the 1st
Pariccheda and 21 verses of the 2nd Pariccheda, the copyist has
rumbered the folios serially from 1 to 78 and secondly our MS
contains scribal errors though it is nearly writion, which would
not have been the case, had it been a TYHTGT prepared under the
direct supervision of the author. Our copy appears, however, to
be very old being characterized by the use of Tehrals.
Our commentator Jñānaprainoda belonged to TATT, which
is the 11 th branch line from the main line of ataTTITEEB.' The
commentary was composed in Samvat 1681 ( = A. D. 1625) when
जिनराजसूरि was the head-monk of the बहत्वरतरगच्छ (जिनराजसरि.
TARTTIÀ). He died in Samvat 1699 (= A. D. 1643) at Patan i.e.
18 years later. A year later i.e. in A. D. 1644 the ATATTOO
divided into several branches. The “ARTEZArdara' referred to
in the colophon is the line founded by Artigiart.His predeces-

foratoire - This Sūri mentioned in verse 8 of the colophon is
No. 63 of the Jain Pațțāvali. As we have remarked above
he was at the head of the greatnes at the time when the
commentary by Jñanapramodagani was composed in
Saṁvat 1681 ( = A. D. 1625). He died in Samvat 1699
(= A. D. 1643). His parents belonged to the difETTET TIA.
One of the pupils named the attor who belonged to the
same strat viz. UTETETTI was made Sūri by him and named
जिनसागरसूरि, who is identical with जिनसागर mentioned in
verse 9 of the colophon. The branch of Kharataragaccha
called the लघुखरतरगच्छ began with जिनसागरसूरि in Samvat
1686 ( = A. D. 1630).
The expression FSTTTTTH ayantraeftor of verse 9 of the
colophon obviously refers to the fact, corroborated by the Pattāvalis,
that starter installed a97as as a Sūri in his own line. In verse
10 of the colophon we are informed that an illustrious branch of the
Kharataragaccha was named after #m7ZHIT,while verse 11 states
that Threatent belonged to the branch-line called after ATTE. This
धर्मरत्न is the same as was installed by जिनचंद्रसूरि in his line as stated
in the Pattāvali. Verse 12 of the colophon mentions that agh was
the pupil of this धर्मरत्न. After वल्लभ comes दयाधर्मगणि and after him
is mentioned siirty# (verse 13). Verse 14 of the colophon intro-
duces us to Teatrit who was the direct preceptor of our commentator
as stated in verse 17. This preceptor pentrefft belonged to the line of
gureaat. Verses 15 and 16 of the colophon contain merely
laudatory description of Taufit who, as we have seen above, was
the immediate preceptor of our author ज्ञानप्रमोदगणि.

furnished by the only available MS of Jñänapramoda's commentary
on the Vagbhațālaṁkära. It is not the object of the present paper
to discuss the literary merits of the commentary in question and
hence that question must be left to other scholars. Our purpose
in the present study is mainly historical and more specifically
chronological, as chronology is the very back-bone of all historical
research.
As the present commentary furnishes its own date of composi-
tion, internal evidence is of no use for purposes of its chronology.
Some of the references it makes to previous authors and worke
may, however, be noted here as the commentary is represented
only by two MSS so far as we know. These references are the
following :-

Though the commentary does not bristle with references as in
the case of Mallinatha's commentaries, it is quite learned in its tone
and treatment.

MEGHAVIJAYAGANI'S COMMENTARY ON HASTÄSA NJIVANA
87
The description of the Ulwar MS of the Hastasanjivana by
Peterson creates an impression that the text of the work is written
by one Jain author, while the commentary has been written by
Meghavijayagaại. In the colophon of the Ulwar MS the name of
this commentary is recorded as “सामुद्रिकलहरी." In a MS of the
Hastasañjivana recently acquired by the B. O. R. Institute we find
the following elaborate colophon:
Last Folio 20%

1. The number of stanzas in the MS is about 500 excluding the
prose comment. These stanzas are not, however, all of them in
anuptup metre, some of them being quotations from earlier works.

इति श्रीहस्तसंजीवने सिद्धिज्ञानशाको महोपाध्याय-
श्रीमेघविजयगणकविरचितं हस्तसंजीवनं संपूर्ण ॥
श्रीरस्तु ॥ सिद्धिरस्तु ॥ वाक्सत्यतास्तु"
(Here a line in Persian characters is recorded by the
scribe). The metaphor of मेघ (cloud) and वृष्टि (rain) in stanza 85 of
above extract is also found in the following extract from folio 2:-
"सामुद्रिकोन्दोधपयो निपीय मेघो रसं वर्षति मृ...मुया ।
समेघतां तेन सुखेन लोकः श्रीहस्तसंजीवनमेतदायम् ॥ २० ॥
इति श्रीहस्तसंजीवने सिद्धज्ञाने शास्त्रपीठिका ॥"
Sometimes the verses are followed by a prose comment introduced
by the words "भाष्य यथा" which show that the MS contains both the
text and commentary.
The question now arises : Is Meghavijaya the author of the
हस्तसंजीवन as stated in the colophon "मेघविजयगणकविरचितं हस्तसंजीवन" ?
With a view to deciding this question we niust record some of the
colophons in the body of the MS. These colophons' are as
follows :-
Folio 8-"इति हस्तसंजीवने सिद्धज्ञाने तिथिवारनक्षत्रवेलादिवर्णगंधरसस्पर्शा.
कारादि हस्तस्वरूपवर्णनाधिकारः॥१॥
Folio 11-"इति ह(स्तसंजीवने) ह(स्त)स्पर्शनाधिकारः"
Folio 19-"इति हस्तसंजीवने रेखाविमर्शनं नाम तृतीयाध्यायः ॥"
Folio 20-"इति वामहस्तरेखाविशे प)श्चतुर्थोध्यायः'
These colophons though irregularly recorded in the MS indicate
that the work Hastasanjivana consists of 4 adhyāyas or adhikäras.
Let us now record the works and authors referred to in the MS.
These are as follows :-
(1) नीतिशास्त्रविवेकविलासे, fol. 1 (Cf. CC I, 298-नीतिविलास and
मीतिविवेक)
(2) नष्टजातक, fol. 5,-(Vide CC I, 282)

1. A MS of the Hastasañjivana at the B. O. R. Institute (No.
1386 of 1886-92) has the following colophons:--Folio 8-
"इति हस्तसंजीवने तिथ्यादिहस्तस्वरूपवर्णनाधिकारः प्रथमः ॥"
Last Folio 11-"इति श्रीहस्तसंजीवने सिद्धज्ञाने हस्तस्पर्शनाधिकार: संपूर्णः ।।"
Evidently this MS is incomplete as it contains 2 adhikåras only.

The foregoing names of works and authors introducing certain
views or quotations pertain mostly to the science of palmistry as
expounded by Jain or non-Jain writers. It is necessary to see if
these works on palmistry are now represented by any extant MSS
in our Manuscript Libraries.
The MS of the Hastasañjīvana analysed above contains some
chronological data which may help us to fix the chronological limits
for the work. On folio 3 we find the following comment :-
• "अत्र सुखावबोधाय किंचिद्भाप्यं य(था) सं। १७३७ मा १६०२ प्रमोदसंवासरे।

As the commentator Meghavijaya uniformly mentions Samvat 1737
(month of A sādha, tithi 2 of Sukla pakşa) I am inclined to think that
our commentator composed his commentary most probably in the
month of Așadha of Samvat 1737 or Saka 1602 (= A. D. 1680-81).
At any rate it seems certain that the date of composition of the
commentary lies in the year Samvat 1737 or after this year but not
prior to A. D. 1680. Now let us see if this chronology of Megha-
vijaya's bhāșya or commentary agrees with other known dates of
his works' viz. A. D. 1660, 1671, 1691.
According to the Jaina Granthavali2 Meghavijaya composed
Candraprabhāțīkā in Samvat 1757 ( = A. D. 1701) and Hemakaumudi
in Samvat 1758 (=A, D. 1702).'
(= A. D. 1702).50(= A. D. 1701) and a composed
If these dates are correct, we may take it for certain that
Meghavijayagani's literary career lies between A. D. 1650 and say
1705. It is thus possible that he composed his commentary on the
Fah1977 at least in A. d. 1680-81 or between, say, A. D. 1680 and
1705.
1. Vide p. 425 of Classical Sanskrit Literature by M. Krishnama-
chariar -- Meghavijaya composed his 921 TRISTT in Samvat 1716

MEGHAVIJAYAGAŅI'S COMMENTARY ON HASTASANJIVANA
91
We have now to see if our Meghavijaya the author of the
Bhäşya on the Hastasanjivana is identical with his namesake, the
author of works composed between A. D. 1650 and 1705.
In verse 86 of the colophon quoted above Megliavijaya calls
himself the pupil of Kệpāvijaya ("f7677: noita et staa:').
He also refers to fastan in the same stanza. We have already
seen that the repagatatou, composed in A. D. 1611 by Megha-
vijaya, is a life of Vijayaprabhasūri as stated by Dr. M. Krishnama.
chariar. It is, therefore, clear that our Meghavijaya, the commen-
tator of the Hastasañjivana is identical with his namesake, the
author of works composed in A. D. 1660, 1671, 1691, 1701 and 1702.
It is also proved that our commentator, the author of the Fraga-
meri commentary on the Hastasanjivana composed this commentary
in A. D. 1680-81 or sometime thereafter but before A. D. 1705 or so.
The question already raised by me in this paper regarding the
identity of the author of the Hastasañjivana' with the author of the
Samudrikalahari commentary cannot be answered at present as I
have no other complete MS of both the text and commentary for
examination and comparison.

15. A Contemporary Manuscript of the
Hastasañjīvana-Bhāșya of Meghavijayagani,
Belonging to Raghunātha Mahādeva Ghāțe-
Between A. D. 1680 and 1700 1
mentary on Sanskrit and a feweshavijayagani, i
In a recent paper contributed by me to the Bharatiya Vidya,'
Bombay, I tried to establish that Meghavijayagani, the author of
numerous works in Sanskrit and a few works in Gujarati, composed
his commentary on the Hastasañjīvana either in A. D. 1680-81 or
between A. D. 1680 and 1705. I further suggested that this view
of mine was in harmony with the known dates of composition of
the works of this Jain author viz., A. D. 1669, 1665, 1671, 1691,
1701, 1702 and 1704. Since my paper was sent to the above journal
for publication I have come across a rare MS of the Hastasañjīvana,
which appears to be identical with the Hastasañjīvana together with
Bhasya, the authorship of which is ascribed to Meghavijayagani.
This MS though incomplete is very important as it is a contem-
porary copy of the Hastasañjīvana with Bhāșya, composed by
Meghavijaya and hence supports my chronology for it viz., A. D.
1680-81 or “between A, D. 1680 and 1705."
The MS% of the Hastasañjīvana referred to above belongs to
the Sanskrit Pāthashālā, Rajapur (Ratnagiri District of the Bombay
Presidency). It was presented to this Pāthashālā in 1931 by the late
Narayan Sitaram Ghāțes of the village Harời near Rajapur along
with many valuable MSS from his family collection. The descrip-
tion of the MS is as follows:-
Size:-10 inches by 41 inches.
Material: Country paper, very old, though well preserved.
Extent :-14 folios; 14 lines to a page; about 42 letters to a line.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Verse 87 "Taalaiyattat etc.”; quoted above corresponds to verse 87
of the 3rd adhyāya (terra #31) of the charaa of the B. O. R.
Institute MS of the work acquired in 1942. The rest of the work
as represented by folios 14 to 20 of the B. O. R. I. MS is wanting
in the Rajapur MS before me and hence it is incomplete as the
work consists of 4 Adhyāyas. Perhaps the original from which the
Rajapur copy was prepared was incomplete. The B. O. R. I. copy
which is complete and which gives us some verses at the close
about Meghavijaya, Vijayaprabha and Kệpāvijaya has the same text
(verses and prose HIC) as is found in the incomplete Rajapur MS.
The Bhäsya on folio 3 of the B. O. R. 1.:MS mentions as an
example Samvat 1737, Śaka 1602 Pramoda Samvatsara with other
chronological details which give us the date Friday, 18th June 1680.'
Samvat 1737 is again mentioned on folios 82 and 10 of the B.O.R.I.
MS. This mention of the year A. D. 1680 warrants an inference
that the work Hastasañjīvana-bhāşya of Meghavijaya was composed
either in A. D. 1680 or between A. D. 1680 and 1705, which is the
last recorded date of one of Meghavijaya's works.
I shall now state my evidence for regarding the Rijapur MS of
the Hastasañjīvana as a contemporary copy. This evidence is us
follows:-
(1) 4Fgië of fa# sira, the owner of the Festa MS,
flourished between A. D. 1650 and 1700 and was a contemporary of
hgfTIO, whose dates range between A. D. 1660 and 1704.
(2) यशस्कर was also called येसंभट्ट or रघुनाथभट्ट. His genea-
logy as reconstructed by me is as follows:--
MAITHE (C. 1600 A. D.)
Son
HEITTHE (C. 1650 A. D.)
Sons
Sons
यशस्कर
3 alias रघुनाथ or येसंभट्ट

3 MSS dated A.D.
[ 1682, 1683 )
1. Folio 4a of Rajapur MS contains the extract giving these
chronological details.
2. Vide folio 9a of the Rajapur MS.

CONTEMPORARY MANUSCRIPT OF HASTASANJIVANABHAŞYA
95
(3) यशस्कर घाट or घांटे composed some works on dharmasastra
viz., srafaizriet fauterizarafe, BÀYTETA etc. In these works he
mentions farofaray#TT i.e. the author of the facialary of Kamalākara
which was composed in A. D. 1612.
(4) TFT performed a ty in A. D. 1680 and kept a record of
it in his own handwriting. This document records his name and
the year A. D. 1680 when the 574 was performed.
(5) The Rajapur MS of the Foiraa must have been copied
presumably between A. D. 1080 and say 1700 i.e. during the life-
time of यशस्कर or रघुनाथ महादेव घांटे of the village Hardi near Rajapur,
where his descendants are still living. The fact that this MS
belonged to यशस्कर (alias रघुनाथ) महादेव घांटे is clear from the endorse-
ments at the beginning and end of the Rajapur MS of the हस्तसंजीवन.
Similar endorsements are found on other MSS belonging to 77777-
He and his brother spaahe, both of whom flourished between A. D.
1630 and 1700. These brothers were definitely living between
A. D. 1680 and 1683 as proved by the record of these dates on their
MSS. In my paper' on tgart Arca spiz (between A. D. 1650 and
1700) I have recorded sufficient contemporary documentary evi-
dence regarding the chronology of the works of this author and
hence it need not be repeated here.
That an author who flourished between A. D. 1650 and 1700
should own a copy of the हस्तसंजीवनभाष्य of मेघविजय proves beyond
challenge the contemporary character of the copy and hence sup.
ports my limits for the date of composition of this work viz.
"between A. D. 1680 and 1700.” Vost probably the work was com-
posed in the year A. D. 1680 which is mentioned twice or thrice
in the body of the work.

16. The Chronology of the Commentary of
Sadānandagaại on the Siddhānta-Candrikā of

Aufrecht' records a few Mss of a commentary on the Siddhanta-
Candrikā of Ramacandrāórama by Sadānandagani but records no
date of composition of this commentary. Dr. Belvalkara refers to
this commentary in his account of the “Commentaries on the
Sārasvata independently of the Prakriyā" but records no chrono-
ogy for the work of its author. H. P. Sāstridescribes a few Mss
of Sadanandagani's Subodhini but makes no remarks about its date
of composition. Prof. H. D. Velankar in his Jinaratnakośa or
Catalogus Catalogorum of Jain Mss refers to Subodhini Vịtti con-
posed by Sadānandagaņi, pupil of Bhaktivijaya of the Kharatara-
Gaccha but does not mention its chronology. The Jaina Grantha-
vali also refers to this author without recording his chronology.
I propose, therefore, to record in this paper some information about
this author and his commentary Subodhini on the Siddhānta-
candrikā.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY MISTORY
The foregoing analysis of the Mas of Subodhini of the Jain
commentator of the Siddhānta-Candrikā proves the following
points about his history and chronology:-
(1) Sadānandagani (=S) composed this commentary in
A. D 1743.
(2) S belonged to tlie Khurataragaccha, his guru being
Bhaktivinaya.
(3) S was a very close student of Sanskrit grammar as will
be seen from his voluminous commentary Subodhini and
his acquaintance with tlie works of previous writers on
grammar as also the numerous lexicons quoted by him
profusely in his work.
(4) S shows in an ample degree the interest of the Jain
writers' in Sanskrit grammar as late as the middle of the
18th century and maintains the great tradition of
scholastic studies established by such early writers
on grammar Sri Hemacandrācārya.
I shall feel thankſul to our Jain scholar-friends if they bring to
light any other works of Sadānandagaại known to them, either with
private persons or public libraries not accessible to me.
1. Prof. H. D. Velankar in his Jinaratnakośa, which has been
published by the Bhandarkar 0. R. Institute, Poona, refers to three
Jain Commentaries on the Siddhānta-candrikā of Rāmacandra.

(1) Subodhini by Sadanandagaņi, the subject of my present
paper.
(2) Pippana by Candrakirti, which is different from his
commentary on the Sārasvata prakriya (Candrakirti
flourished about A. D. 1550).

17. Date of Sārāvali of Kalyāṇavarman-
Between A. D. 550 and 966 1
Mr. V. Subrahmanya Shastri writes in his preface to the edi-
tion of Sārāxalī' of Kalyāṇavarman: "In my attempts to make our
the ambiguous portion of certain Slokas in JātakapārijataI had to
refer to BỊhajjätaka and its commentary by Bhattotpala to decide
upon the right interpretation of the dubious passages. I found
that Bhattotpala who lived in the time of Emperor Jehangir supported
his explanations of the passages in Varāhamihira's work by largely
quoting from Sārāvali, because his authority on astrological points
was undisputedly acknowledged in his time.” “The author
Kalyāṇavarman appears to have fourished helween the ages of
Varāhamibira and Bhattotpala."
I wonder on what authority Mr. Subrahmanya Shastri makes
the statement that Bhattotpala lived in the time of Emperor
Jehangir whose period of reign is A. D. 1605 – 1627. The date of
Varāhamihira' being A. D). 505 we shall have to conclude on the
assumption of the contemporaneity of Bhattotpala and Emperor
Jehangir that Kalyāṇavarman flourished between A. 1. 505 and
A. D. 1627.
Mr. Shastri's statement, however, appears to be wrong in view
of the following facts: –
(1)
Bhattotpala, the commentator on the BỊhajjātaka of
I Annals (B. O. R. Institute), Vol. XVI, pp. 147--148.
1. Säravali (3rd edition) 1928, Nirnaya Sagar Press, Bombay;
Preface, pp. 1-2.
2. Vide Jätakapārijāta of Vaidyanātha Dikṣita, Vol. I (1932) and
Vol. II (1933) with English translation and Notes by V. Subrahmanya

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Varāhamihira wrote his commentary in A. D. 9:.6.' This com-
mentary is called Jagaccandrikā.?
(2) There is no other commentary on the Byhajjātaka ascribed
to any other Bhattotpala except the one referred to above, which is
expressly dated in A. D. 906.
Our conclusion, therefore, would be that Kalyāṇavarman
flourished between a. D.:05, the date of Varāhamihira and a. D. 466,
the date of Bhattotpala wło quotes from Sārārali as stated by
Shastri in the extract from his Preface given above.
In Duff's Chronology of India, lowever, the following state-
ment is found re. Kalyāṇacarman:-
“ A. D. 578-- Kalyāṇavarman, the astronomer, probably
flourished about this date. He lived after Varāliamihira and was
probably a contemporary of Bralmagupta- Gamakatarangiṇī, ed.
Sudhākara, The Pandit N.S.XIV.”3
We know as a natter of fact that the astronomer Bralmagupta
was born in A. D. 5984 and wrote his Bralimaspkutasiddhanta in
Saka 550 ( = A. D. 628 ) that is at the age of thirty. If Kalyāņa-
varman flourished about A. D. 578, Bradmagupta's literary activity
began about A. D. 628 i.e. about 50 years later. Bralniagupta wrote
another work viz. Khuņdakhādyaka in A.D.665 i.e. 37 years after
the date of the Brahmasphuțasiddhanta. These dates throw some
doubt on the theory of contemporaneity of Bralmagupta and
Kalyāṇavarman so far as the above ficts go.

18. Date of the Grammarian Bhimasena-
Before A. D. COO I
Dr. S. K. Belvalkar in his section on Dhâtupāțha' refers to the
grammarian Bhimasena in the following extract:-
“We next turn our attention to the Mädhavīyadhâtuvịtti which
deals with the same subject and which was written by Mādhava or
Sāyana, the great Vedic Blāsyakāra (1350 A. D.). Sāyaṇa also
mentions numerous workers in tlie si.ine field whose labours he
partly utilised. Among these may be mentioned, as belonging to
the Pāṇiniya School, Bhimasena and Maitreyarakṣita."
Tlie reference to Bhimasena by Sāyaṇa about A. D. 1350 enables
us to fix A.D. 1300 or so as one terminus to the date of Bhimasena.
Aufrecht? records numerous MSS of Bhimasena's Dhatupätha
I New Indian Antiquary, Vol. II, pp. 108-110.
1. Vide p. 53 of Systems of Sanskrit Grammar, Poona, 1915. On
p. 42 Dr. Belvalkar refers to another Bhimasena, the author of a Com.
mentary on Mammața's Kāvyaprakāša, composed by him in
Samvat 1774 1 = A. 1). 1722). He is of course difierent from the
gramınarian Bhimasena, the author of Dhātupāțha. Aufrecht refers
to Bhimasena Dikșita (CC II, 94) who lived under Ajitasimha of
Yodhapura and wrote Kuvalayānanda Khandana. One Bhimasena,
minister of a King of Nepal wrote a work called Sarvalakṣaṇapustaka.
All these name-sakes of the grammarian Bhimasena appear to be
different from him. - The Ind. Office has a MS of Tatrauta by

sena's Dhātupātha in the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. In his

from the pre-existing indices. Pāṇini's Dhātupāțhaconsists of 1944
roots, plus 20 Srauta dhātus which have to be picked up from the
Sūtras of Pāņini. The works on roots of the School of Pāṇini liave

of Panini. It is
many commentaries......... Numbers 4351 to 53 are by Bhimasena
and 4354 is by Maitreya-rakṣita one of the Buddhist Commentators
of Panini. It is later than Bhimasena. Maitreya flourished accord-
ing to Sriſa Babu about 1100 A. D. The greatest work on Sanskrit
roots of this schwol is by the well-known Mādhavācārya. It_has
been published in the Mysore Sanskrit Series. It is of an encyclo.
pædic character. Babu Srisa Candra has written a commentary
on the Dhātupradipa by Maitreya in his edition published by the
Varendra Research Society.”
If Bhimasena is earlier than Maitreya-rakṣita (who flourished
about A. D. 1100) the date of our Bhimasena is pushed back by 250
years from A.D. 1350, the date of Sāyaṇa, who refers to him as
stated by Dr. Belvalkar. We have now to see if we can push back
the date of Bliimasena still further backwards from A. D. 1100.
The evidence on the strength of which I propose to push back
Bhimasena's dale by at least 500 years from A. D. 1100, the date of
Maitreya-rakṣita is as follows:
The Tattvārthādhigam sūtra, a treatise on the fundamental
principles of Jainism was composed by Umāsvāti with his self-com-
posed commentary (Sropajñabhäşya) "between the 1st and the 4th
centuries of the Vikrama era” according to Prof. H. R. Kapadia'
or between 1 and 85 A.D. according to Saris Chandra Vidyabhushan.'
Sidhasenagaại composed a commentary on Urāsvāti's Sutra and
bhāsya. In this voluminous commentary lie refers to many previ-
ous Sūris". In his discussion of Siddhasena's date Prof. Kapadia

TUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
states that "Siddhasena's date does not go atead of the 7th century"
(p. 61 of Introduction). Satischandra Vidyabhushan assigns Sidda-
sena to about 600 A. D. (Vide p. 182 of History of Indian Logic).
In view of this early date for Siddhasena the following reference
to वयाकरण भीमसेन enables us to fix A. D. 600 or so as one terminus
to Bhimasena's date:-
Pages 254 - Umāsvati's bhāsya reads:-
- "चिती सज्ञानविशुद्धयोः धातुः । तस्य चित्तमिति भवति निष्ठान्तमौणादिकं च"
Siddhasena comments :
बिती सज्ञानविशुद्धयोर्धातुरिस्यादि । भीमसेनापरतोऽन्थैर्वयाकरणैरथंद्वये पठितो
धातुः सज्ञाने विशुद्धौ च । इह विशुद्वयर्थस्य सह सम्झानेन ग्रहणम् । अथधानेकार्थी
धातवः इति सम्ज्ञाने पठिनो विशुद्धावपि वर्तते । भाष्यकृता चोपयुज्यमानमेवार्थमभि-
सन्धाय विशुद्धिरपि पठिता तस्य चित्तमिति रूपं भवति निष्ठान्तमौणादिकं च चेततीति
चित्त विशुद्ध यतीत्यर्थः।"
I believe the reference in the above extract to भीमसेन वैयाकरण and
his धातुपाठ contained in the expression "भीमसेनापरतोऽन्यैवैयाकरणरथं.
द्वये पटितो धातुः'' is quite explicit and it needs no) elaborate proof for
establishing the identity of this भीमसेन with भीमसेन, the author of
the urgers followed by Maitreyarakṣita in A. D. 1100 and referred
to by Sayana about A. D. 1350 as already pointed out in this paper.
I have not searched for other references to Bhimasena in
Siddhasena's voluminous commentary as such search is rendered
quite difficult in the absence of any index to proper names accom-
panying I'rof. Kapadia's edition.
We know practically nothing about this grammarian but as he
has been now proved to be earlier than A. D. 600 or so on account of
Siddhasena's reference to him scholars interested in the history
of Sanskrit graminar will do well to gather more information about
him than what they have gathered and recorded so far.

19. The Date of Mahākṣapaņaka's
Anekārthadhvanimanjari f
Vardhamān:' in his Gunaratnam:hodadhi refers to Ksapaņaka'
in the following quntation, verse 261: tālo dhanuși piyükşā; Commen-
tary: piluvācis pīyükșanniti Kșapaņakaḥ pīyükṣāyāḥ paiyükşam.
As Vardhaināna composed his work in A. D. 1110, Ksapanaka must
have written his work before that date.
Zachariae* thinks that Kșapaņaka and Mahākşapaņaka may be
identical authors. He observes in this connection: “The time of
Mahākṣapanaka cannot be determined at present. The older
commentators including Rāyamukuta appear not to know his work.
Perhaps Mahākṣa panaka is identical with Kșapaņakı, a commentator
of the Unādisūtra.” If the above presumption about the indentity
of Ksapanaka and Malāks panaka is correct, the date of Mahākşa-
panaka" who is the author of Anekārthadhvanimanjari and Ekāksara-
kośn, goes back to a period before A. D. 11.0, the date of Gana-
ratnamahodadhi.
I have to record in this note some additional data, which push
back the date of Mahākşapanaka by more than 200 years.
Vallabhadeva, the author of the commentaries on the Mahā-
kávy:s, rarely resorts to authority in support of his interpretations.
I have, however, found the following quotation from the Anekārtha.

vamba, viz. No. 449 of 1887_-91 of the Govt. Mss Library at the
B. O. R. Institute: narapatiścakame my gayāratin samadhumanma-
madhumanmathasamnibhah. This is the second line of the stanza 59'
of the text. Vallabha's commentary on this line reads: manmatha-
kämah tatsabhānamadhūmad yani madhūkņaudramadhupuşparasastatha
i madhurdaityo madhuścairro madhuko' pi madhurmirdūḥ anekartha-
mañjarī. The lexicon Anekārthamañjarī from which Vallabha quotes
in the foregoing extract appears to be that of Malākşapanaka, a
Kashmirian. It is natural that Vallabha, himself a Kashmirian,
should quote from an earlier lexicon composed by another · Kash-
mirian Mabākşapınaka. T'he above quotation can be identified in
a Ms of Anekārthadhvanimañjari (No. 270 of 1880---8! of the Govt.
Mes Library - B. O. R. Institute). This Ms is dated Samvat 1568
(= A. D. 1512). On folio 1 of tle Ms the quotation appears as
under: madhurdaityo madhuścaitro madhukopi madhurmmataḥ. The
lexicon in question is known by two names. Two Niss of the
work-one described by Rajendralal Mitra? and another by Dr.
Eggeling - have the title Anekārthamañjari similar to that used in
Vallabha's quotation given above. The work is also called Anekā-
rthadhvanimanjari and many Mss are recorded under this title by
Aufrecht in his Catalı gus Catalogorum. Eggeling also describes a
Ms under this title in his Catalogue of India Office Mss.“
Now as regards the date of Vallabhadeva, he is put by scholars
in "the first half of the 10th century ;5 for, his grandson Kayyața,
son of Candrāditya, wrote a commentary on Anandavardhana's
Devisataka in 977---78 A. D. during the reign of Blimagupta of
Kashmir (977---S2 A. D. ). To be more specific about Vallabha's
date we are informed that he lived about A. D.925.6
In view of the above chronology about Vallabha we shall have
to fix the first half of the 10th century or roughly A. D. 925 as the

As regards the terminus a quo for the date of Anekārthadhvani.
mañjarī we have no evidence to fix it except the worthless legend
of the Nine Jewels' at the court of Vikramāditya. Candragupta
II (A. D. 401)2 adopted the title of Vikramāditya and according to
Keith's suggestion the fame of this Vikramāditya as the patron of
the poets may be looked upon as having its attestation in the legend
mentioned above. According to this legend the literary distinction
of Candragupta's court was mainly due to the Nine Jewels or men of
literary eminence, viz. Dhanvantari, Kșapanaka, Amarasimha, etc.
If one is inclined to give any credence to the suggestion adumbrated
above we may have to regard about A. D. 350 as the terminus a quo
for the date of the lexicographer Ksapaņaka (or Mahākşpaņaka)
referred to in the legend. In the present state of Indian chronology,
however, we are not inclined to take any precipitous leaps into the
domain of the unknown.

20. The Nature and Contents of a Lost Medical
Treatise by Kharanāda or Khāraņādi 1
Aufrecht' refers to 77519 as the name of an author referred to by
Aruņadatta in his commentary on the Asțāngahrdaya of Vāgbhata II.
The following passage is found in Aruņadatta's commentary
on verse 34 of Chapter 1 of the Cikitsitasthāna of the Astāngahşdaya.2
'तथाच खारणादिरपाठीत-"बहुव्यो धनः स्वच्छमपीपधं जलम " इति'
In foot-note 7 on p. 549 the editor notes the variant Artis-
पाठीत'. These two variants वारणाादे and खरनाद found in two MSS
of Aruņadatta's commentary Sarvaigasundarā on the Aștājigahrdaya
give rise to the question whether the correct naine of the author
quoted by Aruņadatta' (about 1220 A. D.) is thic or 577777. This
doubt is further aggravated by the use of the variant 175te in the
following passage from Aruņadatta's commentary on verse 77 of
Chap. I of the Cikitsitasthāna (p.559) :-
"खरणादेऽप्युक्तम्-'पटोलं फलं निम्बं कर्कोटककठिल्लकम् । शाकं पर्पटकं च
fara' gras
As against these three variants viz. (1) Erik ; (2) tortic and (3)
par found in the MSS of Aruņadatta's commentary, we find that
Hemādri has quoted extensively from a medical writer called by
him as 'armita'. As Aufrecht does not record any MSS of the

It will be seen from the foregoing extracts that Hemādri (about
A. D. 1271) had before him a medical work by a writer of the name
खारणादि and even though the work has been now lost, the quotations
recorded above will acquaint the reader with the form and nature of
its contents. It appears that in Hemādri's time and even earlier
the treatise of Khâraņādi was looked upon with authority since a
writer of Hemādri's learning and literary repute quotes from it
extensively as an authoritative work. From the identity of a quota-
tion ascribed by Hemādri to EITTOTfe, and to mare by Arunadatta we

Page 157****************************************************************************************

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
have suggested above that the names tartotic and walk are indenti-
cal. Let us now see if the name arsurfe uniformly used by Hemādri
in his quotations from this treatise is corroborated by any contem-
porary usages. Fortunately for us such contemporary testimony
has been forthcoming from Vopadeva and his father Keśava.
Vopadeva was a protégé of Hemādri and was the author of several
works'. The following verse2 found at the end of the Muktā.
phala shows us the versatile productivity of Vopadeva :-
“यस्य व्याकरणे वरेण्यघटनाः स्फीताः प्रबन्धा दश । प्रख्याता नववैधकेऽपि
तिथिनिधारार्थमेकोद्भुतः । साहित्ये अय एव भागवततत्वोक्तीत्रयस्तस्य च भूगीर्वाणशिरो-
मणेरिह गुणाः के के न लोकोत्तराः ॥"
Farquhar. assigns Vopadeva“ to 'c. 1300 A. D' or 'End of the
13th century'. Our Vopadeva should not be confounded with a late
writer of the same names who wrote a commentary on the Rasaman-
jari of Bhānudatta in A. D. 1572.
1. Vide Aufrecht, CC I, 616a - Vopadeva was son of Keśava and
pupil of Dhaneša. He was Pandit to Mahādeva, King of Devagiri.
He is quoted in the Mädhavīyadhātuvștti. He comsosed the fol-

In view of the close personal contact of Hemādri and his
learned protégé Vopadeva, it is possible to suggest that the treatisc
of 'ETTOTIE' used by the one is exactly identical with that used by
the other and mentioned as 'Aitor' as the following quotations in
Vopadeva's Siddhamantraprakāśa' will amply prove:-
Folio 5 --Kesava refers to trofa in the following verse:-
"घातलं चरको धूते वातघ्नं षष्टि (सु)श्रुतः ।
खारणादिवंदस्यन्यदित्युक्तेरन निर्णयः ॥ ५ ॥"
Vopadeva comments :" guarisTAETTOTTENT: etc. " I "776-
सुश्रुतखारणादीनां च परस्परविरुद्वानां द्रव्यशक्तिविषयानामुक्तीनामनग्रंथे निर्णयो
Fatoſtarietai." This comment makes it clear that the treatise
of ETTORI had assumed so much importance in the 13th century
that Keśava wrote the work Siddhamantra to determine the mutu.
ally conflicting texts of Caraka, Suśruta and Khāraņådi as stated by
Keśava in the verse quoted above. It is also clear that Keśava, a
contemporary of Aruņadatta (about 1220 A. D.) uses the name
OTTOTIT and not ataic used by the latter as we have seen already.
This evidence shows that in the 13th century the names apart and
arcotia were current in Bengal and Mahārāștra' respectively and

perhaps owing to the love of 'taddhita' formations ascribed to the
dākṣinātyas by the author of the Mahābhāsya the form arToIE
became current in the Mahārāṣtra as proved by the usages of the
name in the works of Keśava, his son Vopadeva and Hemādri, the
friend and patron of Vopadeva. As the treatise of artit has been
lost it is advisable to collect all quotations from it wherever
found. I shall, therefore, record here the following quotations in
Vopadeva's Siddhamantraprakāśa (B. O. R. I, MS):-

Keśava states that he was honoured by THE TIG (FÄETIFITARI
). His son explains :-"BETTGTHHTTİ 715.971 GT81977..........
METTTT EF HETETETT TT TTGTTzia: -- METIS the patron of Vopadeva's
father is identical with Tagh or PEUT (II) (of the Later Yādavas of
Devagiri) who ruled from 1210 to 1247 A. D. (Vide p. 189 of Padhye's
Life of Hemād pant and Duff's Chronology, p. 310.) The date of
FAG 77 of Keśava may be between 1210 and 1247 A. D. It appears
that the capital of FAETF was a797 as stated by Vopadeva and that
ofta was a resident of Vedapura.
Singhaņa had in his employ an astronomer called Cangadeva
the grand-son of the celebrated Bhāskarācārya. Cangadeva was con-
temporary of Keśava, Vopadeva's father. This Cangadeva founded a
matha at Pātan (10 miles from Chalisgaon in Khandesh) for the study
of the works of his grandfather and others (Vide Epi. Ind. I, 340 ff.).
The inscription by Cangadeva at this mațha appears to have been
written some years after Saka 1128 ( = A. D. 1206) and it describes
Cangadeo as"f9670777391991:.” In another inscription (of Saka 1144
(= A. D. 1222)- Epi. Ind., III, p. 112] we find the name of one Ananta-
deva, who is called Daivajñāgraņi at Singhaņa's Court (Vide History
of Indian Astronomy by S. B. Dikshit, Poona, 1896, p. 248).

From the above quotations from artoitke I have been able to
identify 2 verses in the quotations from ertonte recorded by
Hemādri in Ayurvedarasāyana. This identity, inspite of the slight
variations of readings, proves beyond doubt that the treatise of
Khāraņādi known to both the writers viz. Hemādri and Vopadeva,
who were not only contemporaries but friends, is identical.
With the data recorded above we are in a position to sum up
the results of our discussion as follows:-
(1) Arunadatta (about 1220 A. D.) quotes from a medical
writer of the name खरनाद.
(2) Arunadatta appears to have been a contemporary of Kesava,
whose patron was King Singhana of Devagiri (A. D. 1210-1247).
(3) Hemādri in his Ayurvedarasāyana ( after 1270 A. D.)
quotes extensively from a treatise mentioned as that of खारणादि.

(4) Keśava's medical work Siddhamantra mentions the name
of Artie and attaches some importance to his views even though
they were at variance with those of Caraka and Suśruta.
(5) The identity of a quotation of three lines found in Aruņa-
datta's commentary on the Aştāngahrdaya as from Kharanāda and
in Hemādri's commentary on the same work as from Khāraņādi
makes it highly probable that Kharanāda and Khāraņādi are iden-
tical medical writers.
(6) Vopadeva, the son of Keśava and friend of Hemādri quotes
from Khāraņādi's treatise.
(7) The identity of two stanzas of Khāraņādi quoted by
Vopadeva with two stanzas of Khāraņādi mentioned as such by
Hemādri in his Ayurvedarasāyana proves that both these commenta-
tors are referring to an identical work of Khāraņādi.
(8) Khāraņādi's treatise, judging by the quotations, appears
to have been in verse. It must have been composed before say
A. D. 1150 as it is quoted largely by Arunadatta and Keśava about
A. D. 1220 and by Vopadeva and Hemādri about 1275 A. D. It
would really be an achievement if this treatise of Khāraṇādi, the
subject of this paper is discovered hereafter by any one interested
in the history of the Aryan medical science. With a view to helping
such discovery I note below a reference to arrang: in the commen-
tary of Niếcalakara' on Cakrapāņidatta's Dravyaguņa-Samgraha
(MS No. 620 of 1895-1902).
1. Aufrecht records the following MSS of the Dravyaguna-
Samgraha and its commentaries :-
CC 1, 264—"W. p. 294, L 2931, Ben. 64, Bik. 634"
- Comm, by Niscalakara Bik. 634
--Comm. by Sivadāsa, L 2932"

i . - Comm. by Niscalakara Bd. 889 (No. 889 of 1887-91).
--Comm. by Sivadāsa, son of Anantasena, Hpr. 1189."
Hence we have 3 MSS of Niścalakara's commentary viz. (1) at
Bikaner and (2) and (3) in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. In-
stitute, Poona, one of which viz. No. 889 of 1887-91 is mentioned by
Aufrecht. The other MS viz. No. 620 of 1895–1902 was acquired
subsequent to Aufrecht's Catalogue.
Cakra pāņidatta's father was Nārāyaṇa of the Lodhravati family
and was a minister as also the Superintendent of the culinary depart.

The above quotation appears to be from the work of arporfe but
I am unable to say if it is taken first-hand from the treatise in
question or is a second-hand one taken from Arunadatta or Hemādri.
This quotation gives us another variation of this author's name viz.
cartarg'. Hence we have the following variations of the name of
one and the same medical author :-
(1) apara, (2) argang, (3) apoia, (+) anonifa.
The MSS of Niścalakara's commentary appear to be rare. The
date of Cakrapānidatta' is about 1060 A.D. The date of Niścalakara
has not been fixed but he is earlier than Sivadāsa who professes
that he has based his commentary on the Ratnaprabhā (of Niscala-
kara). Mr. N. N. Das Gupta says that Sivadāsa's date is ‘16th
Century' because he was court physician of Bārbek Shāh of Bengal.
Mr. Lane Poole? gives A. D. 1459 or A. H. 864 as the date of
Bārbek Shāh of Bengal (House of llyās) and if this king
is identical with the patron of Sivadāsa, the date of Siva-
dāsa's commentary would be the middle of the 15th century
and consequently the Ratnaprabhā commentary of Niscalakara
can be assigned to the period commencing about A. D. 1150
and ending with about 1400 A. D'. These limits can be further

His commentary was based upon an older commentary called TFTHT
(vide N. N. Das Gupta's article in Indian Culture, III, p. 157.) Siva-
dāsa's commentary has been edited by Devendra Nath Sen (1st edn.).
Evidently the commentary TATHT mentioned by Sivadāsa is identical

by Dr. Hoernle.' Niscalakara tells us that his father was Sadanan-
dakara (v.3) and that he wrote this commentary VATH (which he
calls get) to give a polish to the gem viz. the DC which was
darkened on account of bad commentaries' prevailing on the demise
of Vijaya Raksita, who is called आयुर्वेदगुरु.
The line 'आयुर्वेदगुरौ स्वर्ग गते विजयरक्षित' if interpreted to
contain a reference to the death of Vijaya Rakşita as an occurrence
within the memory of the commentator Niścalakara, would enable
us to fix the date of the Ratnaprabhā to about 1300 A. D. In
this case we have to imagine that the death of Vijaya Rakşita (about
1240 A. D. ) was looked upon in contemporary medical circles as a
great loss to the science of Ayurveda. Our commentator being
perhaps a junior contemporary of Vijaya Rakşita and a great admirer
of this Ayurveda-guru deplores the demise of this guru and himself
undertakes the work of giving proper interpretation of Cakra.
pāņidatta's work by way of his tribute to the departed guru. He,
therefore, asks his daughter Fagot to serve the pre-eminent
physician ( Hora FATHİ T77).
If the above hypothesis gets corroborated by further internal
evidence or by external evidence, the reference to FITOTT by
Niścalakara becomes almost contemporaneous with Hemādri',

21. Antiquity of the Lost Medical Treatise
by Khāraṇādi in the Light of the Leaf of
the Khāraṇāda-Nyāsa Newly Discovered
at Gilgit
In my recent article' on the “Nature and Contents of a Lost
Medical Treatise by Kharanāda or Khāraņādi” I tried to record
some useful data? regarding this lost medical treatise from re-
ferences to it by Aruņadatta (about 1220 A.D.), by Hemādri (between
A. D. 1270 and 1300 ), by Keśava (the father of Vopadeva ) who was
patronized by King Singhaņa of Devagiri (A. D. 1210-1247) and by
Vopadeva himself, the protégé and friend of Hemādri. It was also
pointed out that Niscalakara in his commentary on Cakrapāņidatta's
Dravya-guna-Samgraha' refers to this author as “Khāranāda.”

Hoernle (Osteology, p. 17) states that on the Pathology (PATT) of
Madhava there exists a commentary called # #137 which is a joint-
work of fastera (C. 1240 A. D.) and his pupil 14057a.
There is a Ms of Vyākhyākusumavali at the B. 0. R. Institute

There is a possibility of Niścalakara being contemporaneous with
Hemādri as suggested by me in my article on Khāraṇādi referred
to above. At any rate he can be assigned to a period between A. D.
1250 and 1400.
As regards the limit for the date of Khāranādi I suggested
that he must be earlier than A. D. 1150. Since I sent the above
paper to the press I received the issue of the Journal of the Mythic
Society.? Bangalore, containing the “Report on the Gilgit Excavation
in 1938” by Pt. M. S. Kaul, M. A.., M. 0. L., of Srinagar (Kashmir ).
This report contains a leaf from the MS of Khāraņādanyāsa
(Plate 1442 A and its Devanāgari transliteration on pp. 9–10).
Pt. Kaul states that this is a "Commentary on a work of
Kharanāda on Medicine giving portion of a chapter relating
to pregnancy. Both the text and commenatry are known at
present in and through quotations only, though the former
seems to have heen as old as the Așțārgahrdaya of Vāghhața. The
text is quote : hy Arundatta in his commentary on the Astānga-
hrdaya at pane 249 and bv Vācaspati' in his commentary on the
Mädhavanidāna at page 50."
1. Vide p. 61 of Poona Orientalist, Vol. IV.
2. Vol XXX, No. 1 (July 1939) pp. 1-12. Pt. Kaul took his
Excavation Party to Nawapura in Gilgit (229 miles from Srinagar) on
4th August 1938 ; some mounds excavated at this place brought to
light stūpas of clay, birch bark Mss, ivory rings, brass rings, one ear-
pendant, some pieces of gold, red and white pearl beads, birch-hark
amulets, coral beads, a gold coin, iron and brass pieces, a gold-plated
amulet with the image of the Lion-head on both sides.-The Mss
excavated include (1) a work called Sarighātasiītra in Buddhist Sans-
krit (about 80 leaves), containing on the inside of the top-cover
paintings of Puriša or Lord of Gilgit and his minister. There are
two ladies seated in front of them, (2) Mss in fragments not yet
deciphered and (3) Torn leaves from the Ms of Khäranädanyāsa, a
leaf from a collection of fables, a leaf from the Buddhist Sanskrit
Grammar and leaves of a prose composition in Sanskrit recording
an incantation to protect the king of Gilgit (whose full name is
"$ähānusāhi Navasurendra Vikramāditya Nandideva”) and his queen
Anangadevi. According to Pt. Kaul this Manuscript hoard is "not
later than the ninth century A. D. ", "nor can it be earlier than the
seventh century A. D.”. One of the Mss records the year of copy-
ing in the "Newari Era which starts with 878 A. D.”
2. Vide p. 17 of Osteology hy Dr. Hoernle, Oxford, 1907.
Dr. Hoernle assigns Vācaspati to "about 1260 A. D.” Vācaspati
states (v. 5 of Intro.) that his father Pramoda was chief physician of
the court of Mahamada Hainmira that is of Muhamad Ghori who
reigned in Delhi from 1195 to 1205 A. D.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The reference to Kharanāda by Vacaspati (about 1260 A. D.)
pointed out by Pt. Kaul is contemporaneous with that by Hemadri
and does not help us in deciding the exact antiquity of this author.
Pt. Kaul remarks that the text of Kharanāda is “as old as the
Astāngahſdaya of Vägbhata.” As the “Aştāngahrdaya'' is assigned
by scholars' to“ eighth or ninth century” the limit for Kharanāda's
date would not be earlier than say A. D. 700. Let us, however, see
the effect of Pt. Kaul's discovery of the leaf of Kharanādanyäsa on
the date of Kharanāda's text itself.
Pt. Kaul states that the Manuscript hoard found by him at Gilgit
cannot be later than 9th century A. D. and at the same time cannot be
earlier than 7th century A. D. If these chronological limits are based
on correct data we can represent the relative chronology of the text
and commentary on Kharanāda's work as follows:---
Text
As old as Astāngahrdaya 8th or 9th century A. D.

I am not aware of the evidence, which leads Pt. Kaul to think
that Kharanāda's treatise “ seems to have been as old as the
Aştāngahſdaya'' but presuming that his statement is substantiated
by reliable evidence it is likely to conflict with the date of the
Astāngahſdaya given by Dr. Hoernle if we accept the date of MS of
the Kharanāda Nyāsa (represented only by one discovered leaf)
as suggested by Pt. Kaula.
-------
1. Ibid, p. 16.
2. Jour. Mythic Soc. (July 1939) p. 8 - Pt. Kaul's argumento
regarding the age of the Mss. discovered by him are :--
(1) The script of the Mss has a close affinity with the Săradă
script as used in the Avantivarman's inscription at the Mārtanţa
temple. Hence the M8s are not later than the ninth century A. D.

: :
In the present stage of the data gathered so far I am inclined
to fix A. D. 650 as the terminus before which Kharanāda may have
composed his work and about 850 A. D. as the terminus before
which the Nyāsa was composed.
As regards the exact name of Kharanāda we have already
recorded the following forms:-
(1) खरनाद according to Arunadatta
(2) antara
Niścalakara
(3) EROTI
Arunadatta ( in one place )
(4) artifa
Hemādri
(5) Do
Kesava
(6) Do
Vopadeva
(7) Do
„ Srikanthadatta
This testimony divided between the forms खरनाद and खारणादि
has not much determinative force as almost all the above authors
belong to the 13th century. The Gilgit fragment of ErTOTIGFUTA
furnishes a better and decisive testimony on this point as the text
of this commentary uses the form ETOIts in the following 1st line
of Plate 1442-A :-
"खारणादन्यासे खुण्डिकागर्भावक्रान्ति शारीरं समाप्तम् ॥"
: :
,
: :
The form afToric used by the commentator is more akin to altar
used by Niścalakara and supports the uniform use of the form
Encorria adopted by Keśava, Vopadeva and Hemādri.
It is a happy coincidence that by the time my article on Khā-
raņādi is prepared and published in Poona, Pt. Kaul should bring
forth a leaf of a commentary on Khāraņādi's work buried for
centuries several feet under ground at Gilgit. I look forward to
the day when both the text of Khāraṇādi's treatise which was
extant, say between 600 and 1300 A. D. as also the newly discover-

the Lost Medical Treatise by Khāraņādi in the light of the Khāraņāda.
Nyasa newly discovered at Gilgit (Annals (B. O. R. I.) XX, 97-102).

years earlier than those hy 31EUTZA (c. A.D. 1220) andeby ? HTFE (C.A.D.

ly earlier than the date of the Gilgit leaf of खारणाद-न्यास discovered by
Pandit M. S. Kaul in 1938. According to Pandit Kaul the date of
the MS lies somewhere between A. D. 600 and 900. do 21. is also

WORKS AND AUTHORS MENTIONED BY CANDRATA
135
logy for Candrata the references to earlier medical authors
and works found in his Yogaratna-Samuccaya are very
important for the history of medical authors prior to A. D. 1000.
1, therefore, give below an alphabetical list of the references to
these works and authors as found by me in the fragments of the
Yogaratna---Samurcaya analysed above:--
(1) अगस्त्य -- अगस्त्यरसायन is mentioned in AH. चिकिासितस्थान,
chap. III, 132 and VI, 55 mentions आनलकलेह which is called अगस्य-
निर्मित। (2) अग्निवेश-Mentioned in AH. अरुणदत्त mentions him (AH,
pp, 4, 5,); mentioned by हमाद्रि (AH, p.5); mentioned by इन्दु (AS, p.
2); mentioned by चरक (CS, p. 7)। (3) अमितप्रभ (Cf. Aufrecht CCI,
28--अमिताभ-योगशतभाग्य 10 2357. NP 1X, 64)। (+) अमृतमाल(तः) । (5)
अश्विनीकुमार । (6) अश्विनीयसंहिता or अश्विनसंहिता। (7) आर्यसमुच्चय । (8)
(Continued from previous page)
No. 19~-I shall examinc in a separate paper the possible identity
of this work a 12717Fi with 71901-17; a medical treatise forming part of
the Bower Januscript.
No. 21--इन्दु quotes अटागह दय (AS, P. 54-- "उपतं च हृदय 'परस्परोपसं-
स्तम्भाद्धातुस्नपरंपरा' गा. अ. ३. ६९"). Possibly इन्दु was a pupil of वाहट or
वाहड, the author of the अष्टांगहृदय, as will be seen from the following
reference (AS, P. 95) :-
"तच्चास्पद गावो यथापकान्तशब्दार्थपरतन्त्रास्तरेवेति च तद्विरतानि परामृतान्ती
वमनादिवत् पूर्व देवताभिसंस्कृत पि वैद्य विधेयतानभिमन्यमानावरकस्य बोद्धारो व्याख्यान-
मभिमन्यन्ते । भट्टारकेण तु 'तथाविधवा द्रव्यः पूर्वमभिसंस्कारः शरीरस्य' इति अस्य वाक्यस्य
व्याध्युत्पत्ति-अनेकान्तिक-प्रदर्शनपरत्वमा कृत्य तथाविधेरिति च विरुद्धसमानि विरुद्धरेव
पूर्वसंस्कारो व्या जनुत्पनिहतुरिति सान्याहारमागतया द्वितीयोऽपि पक्षी य उद्भासितः
साऽस्माभिरूपेक्षित एव ।''
In his Commentary on निशनस्थान (AS-नि. स्थान, 1940) p. 5, इन्टु
quotes froin अष्टांगहृदय as follows :-"येन हृदये पठति--.-"तदेव व्यक्ततां याति
रूपमित्यभिधीयते'' इति" एवं च "स्थिते गपूर्वरूपा: कफपित्तमाः " इति ‘पदा हृदयग्रंथे
व्याख्यासते तत्रैव चौदयिष्याम:.' Pt. Kinjavadekar has already identified
the two lines quoted by इन्दु from हृदय with निदानस्थान I, 5 and x, 41 of
the अष्टांगहाय. 'The statement of इन्दु “हदयग्रन्थे व्याख्यायते तव चोदयिष्यामः"
leads us to infer that he composed a cominentary on the अष्टांगहृदय
as well.
No. 25 - On p. 84 of the भेलसंहिता (1921 Edn.) the views of early
authors on medicine are mentioned. These authors are :-- (1) शौनक,
(2) खण्डकाप्य, (3) पराशर, (4) भरद्वाज, (5) काश्यप, (6) पुनर्वसु आत्रेय.

. I have given the foregoing citations in Candrata's Compendium
of c. A. D. 1000 as they have a direct bearing on the history of
medical literature in India prior to A. D. 1000, which is still
shrouded in mystery. Authors and works mentioned by Candrața
cannot all be traced as some of them are not known even by cita-
tion. It is hoped, however, that the above list would enable
scholars to trace these authors and works in sources earlier than
A. D. 1000. I have added to this list only a few notes which I
could pick up during the course of my study of ancient medical
texts, which is still not very deep. I trust, however, that expert
students of this subject will easily exploit the material laid bare in
this paper and oblige me by throwing some new light on the works
and authors mentioned by Candraţa.

reference in the MS of ca's 69:716 referred to above viz. No.72
of 1873-74, where it occurs on folio 1 at the commencement of
the work. This identification shows that जयदेव's छंदःशास्त्र was written
much earlier than Abhinava's commentary.
Since writing the above note I received from ny friend Mr.
V. Raghavan of Madras off-prints of his articles' on "Writers
Quoted in Abhinavabhārati''. Mr. Raghavan observes with refe.
rence to our 372737 as under :-
p. 222. "37177 is quoted on p. 370, Vol. II.?
सर्वेषां वृत्तानाम् इत्यादी अर्थसमासेन जयदेवोऽभ्यधात् ।
Who this Jayadeva is, is not known. He is twice mentioned as a
writer on Prosody by Namisādhu in his ſikä on Rudrata. Nārā.
yanahhatta in his commentary on the Vsttasatnākara quotes Jayadeva
and his definition of the Upacitrā metre. Jayadeva is twice quoted
in Rāmacandra Budlendra's commentary, Pañcikā, on the Vrtta-
ratnākara.”
We have shown above that this जयदेव is the author of छंदःशास्त्र,
a manuscript of which, with ia's commentary, viz. No. 72 of
1873-74, is available in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R.
Institute. Presumbly this work on prosody must have attained
authoritative character since a polymath like Abhinavagupta quotes
this work as authority.
As Abhinavagupta flourished about 1000 A. D.' and as he refers
to the छंदःशास्त्र of जयदेव as authority, जयंदेव must have flourished before
910 A. D. which may, therefore, be looked upon as one terminus
to जयदेव's date. Our जयंदव, the author of छंदःशास्त्र, is of course dis-
tinct from Fraga, the author of the Gitagovinda who flourished in the
13th century."

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
I shall now give a brief description of MS of the data of Free
viz. No. 72 of 1873-74 as Kielhorn has not apparently studied this
MS. This MS consists of two parts with different numbering of
folios as under:-
(1) Folios 1- 5 - जयदेव's छंदःशास्त्र or उंदस् .
(2) Folios 1- 33 --हर्षट's commentary on the above, called जयेदव.
छंदोविवृत्ति.
जयदेव' छंदस् consists of eight small chapters or sections. The
colophons of these chapters appear as under :-
Folio 1---इति जयदेवछंदास प्रथमोऽध्यायः
,,-द्वितीयोऽध्याय
,,-तृतीयोऽध्यायः
, 2-इति जयदेवछंदास चतुर्थोऽध्यायः

" सं. ११९० मार्ग शुदि १४ सामादने श्री सीसर्वादेवाचार्याय शिष्यस्व
देवचंद्रस्यथय श्रीधरेण जयदेवछंदमूलसूत्रमलिखि"
___ This MS appears to be a copy made in 1873 for Kielhorn
from an old original bearing the date of copying vis. Samvat 1190
(=A. D. 1133). As this is comparatively a very old date I have
tried to verify it, as the colophon fortunately furnishes all parti-
culars necessary for verification in the Ephemeris vix.
(1) सं. ११९० = Vikram Samvat 1190.
(2) मार्ग = Margasirsa month.
(3) शुदि%3 Suklapaksa.
(4) 13 14th Tithi.
(5) सामादने =सोमदिने (I take this to be the correct reading).
Looking to the Ephemeris' I find that the above particulars of the
date of copying exactly correspond to Monday, 13th November 1133.
The reading 'सामादने' of the MS has been taken by me to be
1. Indian Ephemeris, Vol. III, p. 269.

wrongly copied for the correct reading 'htafta' and my guess has
been corroborated by the Ephemeris as in Samvat 1190, the 14th
tithi of the Suklapakşa in the month of Mārgasirşa was HTHTIT or
सोमदिन only. This date of the copy of Jayadeva's Chandahsastra
harmonizes with our conclusion viz. that he must have flourished
before about 950 A. D. in view of Abhinava's reference to this
work in his Abhinavabhārati as pointed out above.
___ The other MS in No. 72 of 1873-74 is a commentary by हर्षट on
जयदेव'छदःशास्त्र described above. The colophon of this MS does
not record the date of the original MS as in the case of the MS of
Jayadeva's work and hence I am unable to say whether the text
of Jayadeva and that of the commentary were copied in the same
year vix. A. D. 1133. Perhaps these two separate MSS were put
together and kept in one bundle when Kielhorn got them copied
and stitched together under No. 72 of 1873-74, as they were allied
to each other.
The MS of the commentary by हर्षट or हर्षट् , as: some of the
colophons record, consists of 33 sheets written on one side of the
sheet only. It begins as follows:-
॥ श्रीगणेशाय नमः ॥
संकरं सास्वतं सौरिं प्रणम्य विवृणोम्यहं ।
जयदेवानि सूत्राणि स्वरूपविधिना स्फुटं ॥।॥
गायत्रिं छंदसां पूर्वा वर्द्धमानाक्षरं परं।
विन(?) नकरं नौमि चित्रवृत्तप्रमिद्धये ॥२॥"
The colophons of the different chapters appear as under:--
Folio 3-"भट्टमुकुलकात्मजविरचितायां जयदेवछंदोविवृत्ती प्रथमो-
ध्यायः"
Folio 4-"भट्टमुकुलकात्मजहर्षटविरचितायां जयदेवछंदोविवृत्ती

It appears from. the colophons quoted above that it was the
son of भट्टमुल. If this भहन फल is identical with tle भट्टमुकल, the
guru of Pratibārendurāji, lidbhata's commentator, we can gather
some information about him and his age. In this connection we
quote from Dr.S.K.De's History of Sanskrit Poctics, Vol. I, f. 77:--
"Pratitārendurāja, Udbhata's Commentator was, as he himself
tells us, a native of Konkanil and a pupil of Nlukula. Mukula is
known to us, as the autlior of Abhidhāvrttimātrkā, a work on the
grammatico-rhetorical question of chhidhā... ... Mukula should be
placed towards the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the
10th. His pupil Pratihärendurāja, therefore, belongs approxima-
tely to the 1st half of the 10th century."
If the identity of हपेट's father भमुकुल with मुकुल the guru of
Pratihārendurāja as presumed by us is correct the chronological
relation of these three persons can be represented as follows on
the strength of Dr. De's remarks quoted above:--

It would, therefore, be possible to regard 542 25 contempora-

roughly say that Er flourished about the middle of the !0th country
i.e. about 950 A. D. As we have put 577T'S 55:17 prior to 950

Mukula in the last Kārikā of Abhidhävyttimātļkā mentions EZ

the 10th Century as the date of Mukula.

first useda Ms of the text of the Arthasästra together with the
fragment of a commentary by Bhatta Svāmin.' In the second
edition of the Arthaśāstra Dr. Shama Sastri utilised two more
commentaries of the work called the Nayacandrikā of Madhava-
yajvanº and the other, a translation or rather paraphrase by an
unknown author in a mixture of Tāmil and Malayālam languages.
Dr. Shama Sastri states that both of these commentaries are incom-
plete as Bhatta Svāmi's commentary.'
M. M. T. Ganapati Sastri who has composed and published
his own commentary on the Arthaśāstra deals in his Introduction
with the necessity of adding a commentary to the text and also
describes the fragments of ancient commentaries secured by him.
He obtained Mss of two commentaries from the Madras Govern-
ment Oriental Library. One of these was a fragmentary copy of a
learned Sanskrit commentary called Pratipadapañcikā by Bhatta-
Svāmin. The other contained a portion of a commentary known
as Nayacandrika by Mādhavayajvan. The source of these Mos
was apparently a palm-leaf Ms belonging to the Kerala country.
These fragments were “full of errors and gaps.” Ganapati Sastri
also made use of a palm-leaf Ms of an ancient Malayālam version

neither a word-by-word commentary like Bhajțasvami's nor a para-
phrase like the Tāmil-Malayālam commentary. Mādhava Yajvan, its
author, satisfies himself by supplying some connecting links between
successive chapters and successive paragraphs in each chapter. The
Tamil-Malayālam paraphrase is, on the other hand, very copious, but
omits to notice obscure passages here and there. It extends from
the beginning to the end of the seventh Book. Written as it is in a
mixture of dialects it is not very easy to understand it. It seems to
be quite recent and is not free from misinterpretation of a few
words."

of the Arthaśāstra on the line of Bhattasvāmin's commentary.
This version was found in the Palace Library at Trivandrum. A
similar copy of this version was found in the Madras Government
Oriental Mss Library. But both these copies were defective.
“Since no ancient commentary in its publishable shape is
available" states M. M. T. Ganapati Sastri, “I thought of writing
one of my own.",
In the foregoing paragraphs I have tried to record the avail-
able commentarial material regarding the Kauțalīya Arthaśāstra
as known to and utilised by the two great scholars viz. Dr. Shama
Sastri and M. M. Ganapati Sastri. In view of the fragmentary and
unsatisfactory nature of the Mss material of the extant commen-
taries on the Arthaśāstra every newly discovered fragment of the
known commentaries or the discovery of an entirely new commen-
tary on the Arthaśāstra must be looked upon as a gain to this impor-
tant branch of scholarship viz., the improvement of the text of
the Arthaśāstra and its final stabilising in a strictly critical manner.
For this purpose the Pattan Ms of Yogghama's commentary as
described by Mr. Dalal should be examined by scholars interested
in this branch of research. Though the Pattan Bhandars were
inaccessible to Dr. Bühler and Peterson when they carried out
their search for Mss in Gujarat more than sixty years ago, it is
now possible for responsible Jain scholars trained on modern lines
to get access to these Bhandars by persuading the authorities in
charge of them to allow at least their co-religionists to make proper
use of the valuable Mss material locked up for centuries in these
rich treasures of ancient learning.
It will thus be seen that the total number of commentaries so
far brought to light, are four only, viz.:-
(1) Bhattasvāmin: Pratipadapañcikā.
(2) Madhavayajvan : Nayacandrikā.
(3) Yogghama : Nitinirņiti.
(4) Anonymous: Tamil-Ma'ayalam version on the line of
Bhatta Svāmnin's commentary.

1. About Ganapati Sastri's self-composed commentary, Dr.
Shama Sastri remarks :-"It will be a great boon to the readers of the
Arthašāstra if Mahāmahopādhyāya T. Ganapati Sāstri, Curator of the
Oriental Library in Trivandram publishes the long-advertised Sanskrit
Commentary which he is said to have been writing with the aid of the

dated 10th July 1923).

MANUSCRIPTS OF COMMENTARIES ON THE ARTHASASTRA
147
We know nothing about the chronology of the above commen-
taries or the personal history of their authors.
The source of the Mss of the commentaries of Bhattasvāmin
and Mädhavayajvan was the Kerala country as we are informed
by M. M. Ganapati Sastri ( Preface, 1923 ). There is a Ms'
of a commentary on the Setubandha, a Prākṣta poem ascribed to
Pravarasena dealing with the destruction of Rāvana by Rāma.
This commentary is ascribed to a commentator called Mādhava-
yajvamisra.' Is it possible to identify this commentator
Madhavayajvan with his namesake, the author of the commentary
Nayacandrikā® on the Arthaśāstra of Kautalya ? The Madras
Ms of the Setubandha vyākhyā was transcribed in 1918-19 from
the original Ms belonging to an owner of Nareri in Malabar
District. The Ms of the Nayacandrikā on which Jolly's edition
of this commentary was based was transcribed in 1917-18 from
the original in the possession of an owner, resident of Chelapuram
(Calicut ). There is, therefore, some possibility of the two
commentators of the same name “Mādhavayajvan" styled in the
colophons of their respective works by identical titles viz.
1. Triennial Cata. of Madras Mss ( 1916-1919 ) Vol. III, Part 1,
1932, R. No. 2772, pp. 3976-78).
2. Ed. in Kávyamālā Series, – the text as printed in this edition
consists of 15 Aśvāsas.

The text of the Setubandha in the Kávyamålă edition has 15
aśväsas only but in the Madras Ms the 16th āśvása is also found
though the 12 theäsväsa is missing.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
"Vådikavi-Cüdāmaņi” and “Mahopadhyāya.”! Pt. Udayaviraśāstri
is of opinion that Mādhavayajvan may have been a däkşiņātya (i.e.
Southerner). He also thinks that he is an ancient commentator
born in the South about 500 years after the demolition of the
Mauryan Empire but the grounds put forward in support of this
belief are not convincing. Perhaps a comparison of the Naya-
candrika and the Setubandhavyākhyā referred to above may give
us a few more facts bearing on the chronology of Mādhavayajvan.
In the Madras Ms of the Setubandhavyākhyā (extract) we find a
definition of the figure faurar quoted by its author as follows :-
the opperhapsã sef colors
"यथोक्तम्-
प्रसिद्धहेतुव्यावृत्या यत्किश्चित्कारणान्तरम् ।
यत्र स्वाभाविकरवं वा विभाव्यं सा विभावना"
This definition of fahraar is exactly identical with Dandin's
definition as quoted by Prof. Kane. It is clear, therefore, from
this identification that Madhavayajvan, the author of the Setu-
bandhavyākhyā is later than Dindin, the author of the Kavyādarśa.
According to Dr. S. K. De' Dindin flourished "probably in the

mentator can mention and quote from very ancient works.

beginning of the first half of the 18th century.” According to
Prof. Kane the date of Dandin is "6th century." Prof. Keith
regards the date of Dandin as “open to dispute' and states “if...
we place the Kāvyādarśa definitely before Bhāmaha (C. A. D. 700 )
there is no reason to assert that he wrote much earlier." His
date may be "anterior to the empire of Harşavardhana and also
anterior to the work of Subandhu and Bāņa.” Inspite of the
disputable character of Dandin's exact date we shall not be wrong
if we state that Madhavayajvan, the author of the Setubandha-
vyakhyā is later than at least the 6th century and if his identity'
with his namesake, the author of Nayacandrikā on the Arthaśāstra
could be proved on valid evidence we would be in a position to
put a definite limit to the date of Nayacandrikā. As, however, the
Ms of the Selubunbhavyākhyā is not before me at present the
question must await investigation at some future time.
As regards the commentary of Bhattasvāmin reference has
already been made above to the Mss of this commentary availed
of by Dr. Shama Sāstri and T. Ganapati Sastri. The available

Viddamayya to whom Cālukya Bhima (11) — A.D. 934-945 — granted a
field at the village of Akulamannaņdu ( Vide Epi. Indicu, Vol. V, 135).
Madhava was devoted to Janārdana (Vişnu). Viddamayya was a student
of the Kramapájha and was eminent in religious learning. His sons
and grandsons were youths eloquent at Committee Assemblies and
were honoured by people. He engaged himself in holy performances,
followed Manu's guidance and was not weary of repeating the Vedas
and the syllable om. The father of Madhava Somayāji was also a
student of Kramapātha and belonged to Gautama lincage. Vidda-
mayya's sons and grandsons are styled as "arraitza aittha:".. an

fragments of this commentary have also been published by Dr. K.
P. Jayaswal in the Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society.'
The object of the present paper being to attract the attention
of the scholars to the Pattan Bhandar Ms of Gogghama's commen-
tary on the Arthaśāstra, I have tried in the foregoing lines to
indicate the importance of this yet unexploited Ms of a rare
commentary from North India on the Arthasāstra. It is hoped that
interested scholars will not fail to exploit this material by persu-
ading the authorities of the Sanghavi Pädā Jain Bhandar to make
this Ms accessible to them for editing purposes so that we shall
have before long in print the available fragments of Commentaries
of (1) Bhațțasvāmin, (2) Mādhavayajvan and (3) Gogghama. In the
absence of any one commentary on the entire text of the Artha.
śästra the value of these fragments for the exposition of this
important text of antiquity must be very great. It is still possi-
ble to discover other commentaries on the Arthaśāstra, because
their existence is indicated by Madhavayajvan himself in his occa-
sional references to earlier commentators."

These remarks were made in 1924 but they are borne out by the
discovery of Gogghama's commentary mentioned in the Baroda
Catalogue of Pattan Mas published in 1938. It remains to be seen if
Gogghama refers to any commentators on the Arthašāstra by name.

Chronological Limits for the Commentary
of Indu on the Aştāngasamgraha of Vāgbhața I
--Between A. D. 750 and 1050 1
In the edition of the Așțārgasangraha' with a commentary of
Indu called Sasilekhå published 31 years ago we are told that
"Sasilekhā is a commentary of Astängasamgraha by Indu one of
the renowned and learned pupils of Vābața.". Evidently this
statement is based on the following verse quoted by the editor in
his Sanskrit Introduction to the edition:-
"लंबश्मश्रुकलापमंबुजनिभच्छायाद्युति वैद्यका.
मन्तेवामिन इन्दुजजटमुखानध्यापयन्सं सदा ।

The Editor in making his observation about the versatile intellect
of the author of the Așțāngasamgraha remarks:-

published as a foreword to this edition observes :-
"A copy of the commentary ( Śaśilekhä ) could not be had in full
anywhere. He ( Editor ) had to go to different places and hunt in
Beveral old manuscript libraries, and to collect lists from here and
there. Several of such lists were worn out by old age and full of
mistakes. It took several years for him to get a clear and complete
copy and the labour and the trouble (with which) he had to compare
and correct it were not ordinary. Even now it is doubtful whether
the copy now prepared is quite free from errors. But I have no
hesitation in saying that it is difficult to get a more correct copy of
the book anywhere. But for the pains and troubles he has taken in
publishing it this important work would have been completely lost."

प्रन्थः । रसशास्त्रसर्वस्वभूतो रसरत्नसमुच्चयश्च यदीयधिषणाविलासे परं साक्षिणः॥"
Evidently in making the above observation the Editor is attribut-
ing common authorship to the three works viz.
(1) the Aşțängasamgraha of Vāgbhata I
(2) the Așțāngahſdaya of Vāgbhaţa II
and (3) Rasaratnasamuccaya of Vāgbhata, wło according to Sir
P. C. Ray was a contemporary of Roger Bacon ( died A.D.
1294 )--Vide History of Hindu Chemistry, p. Ivi of Vol. 1
( Calcutta, 1902 ).
I have already recorded elsewhere the correct views about the
authorship of the three works, by three different authors of the
same name Vāgbhata and hence need not deal with the question in
this paper.
Our Editor on the basis of the common authorship of the three
works further states:-
"श्रीमदष्टांगसंग्रहार्थस्तु कामपि समीचीनां दीपिकामन्तरा परिज्ञातुं दुःशक्त इति
स्थिते अयमिन्दोः उदयः परमप्रमोद एव निखिलप्रपशस्य ॥"
We agree that as the Aştāngasaṁgraha of Vāgblața I was difficult
to be understood a conimentator has come into being in the form
of Indu, the author of the Saśilekh, but it is difficult to make Indu,
a contemporary of Vägbhata I as the Editor does in the following
remarks on no solid evidence except the proverbial Ed1a4914
already quoted by him and reproduced above:-
----
1. Vide p. 4 of my Introduction to the Aşžāngahſdaya, edited
by Vaidya Harishastri Paradkar of Akola (N. S. Press, Bombay, 1938).
2. :Theſidentity of authorship for the A. samgraha and A. hydaya
has been taken for granted by many responsible writers on the history
of Indian medicine. H. H. the Thakore Saheb of Gondal (pp. 34-35 of
his Aryan Medical Science, London, 1896) states :- "In his work
called "Ashtangahridaya” he (Vägbhata) acknowledges the assistance
derived from the writings of Charaka, Sushruta, Agnivesha, Bhela and
others who had gone before him. He also wrote another work
called "Ashtangasangraha,'' on which Pandit Arunadatta wrote a
commentary.'

This is confusion worse confounded as the editor makes Vāgbhata I,
Indu and Jajjața' contemporaries without any historical evidence
and secondly he states that Saśilekhā is a commentary on the
अष्टांगसंग्रह as also on the (अष्टाग) हृदय, a statement which is clearly
refuted by Indu's own statement at the beginning of his own
commentary on the Sūtrasthāna that Sasilekha is a commentary on
the Sangraha and not on the Hşdaya.'

If Candrața ( about A. D. 1000 according to Hoernle ) quotes

that FF and I were contemporaries.

COMMENTARY OF INDU ON THB AŞTANGASAGRAHA
155
The date of Vāgbhata I is "early seventh century" according to
Dr. Hoernle' and as Indu commented on the A. Samgraha? of
Vāgbħața I, his date must be posterior to early seventh century.
We may, therefore, safely fix about 625 A. D. as one terminus to
the date of Indu. Let us now see if we can push forward this
limit on the strength of evidence from Indu's commentary.
In chapter VI of the Sūtrasthāna, Indu makes the following
comment:- ('TOTTEET 24177991a:'l'Heuran Tota fanlagigingar)
(97. 4-2-8) The Editor has identified the above quotation in the
Kāsikacommentary of the Sūtras of Pāṇini, which was composed
( Continued from previous page)
procure any Ms of this important commentary for his edition. The
catalogue statement“ 3121&FUERTEST” is again misleading because
"शशिलेखा is Indu's commentary on अष्टांगसंग्रह and not on अष्टांगहृदय.
Indu describes वाहट as "दुव्याख्याविषसुप्त " i.e. lying in a state of
unconsciousness produced by the effects of the foison of bad com.
mentaries. This statement leads us to suppose that there were some
commentaries on the Astāngasamgraha preceding the Sasilekha of Indu.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITBRARY HISTORY
about 650 A. D. This reference would push forward the limit
of Indu's date to about 700 A. D. if the Editor's identification is
correct,
Another quotation, which, if identified in the extant late
lexicons would enable us to push forward the date of Indu is found
in his comment on verse 17 of chapter II of the Sūtrasthana. It
reads as follows;-
["erri hlutafa” ela 19: )
The Medini lexicon assigned to about the 13th century' has a
similar quotation which reads as follows:-
"आमिषं पुनपुंसकम् । भोग्यवस्तुनि संभोगे"
It is difficult, however, to say if this quotation has a direct relation
with Indu's quotation because it has often been found that some of
the late lexicons have drawn freely on the earlier lexicons and at
times we find two different lexicons borrowing from a common
source.
A better criterion for pushing forward the date of Indu after
700 A. D. is the following quotation from the Aşžārgahrdaya of
Vāgbhata II, who has been assigned to 8th or 9th century A. D. by
Prof. Jolly ( vide p. 16 of Osteology).
Sūtrasthāna comm. on verse 108 of chap. VII (p. 54 of
Kinjavadekar's edition ) -
"J a Egh-q7ETICHRIHIGITfaggiatr" (ITI. 84.3-4)
As Pandit Kinjavadekar has identified the above quotation in the
A. hydaya of Vāgbhata II we have no doubt that Indu was acquain-
ted with the A. hrdaya and it is possible to find more references'

"Padmanabhadatta who wrote his Prşodarādivſtti in A. C. 1375
quotes Medini in his Bhūriprayoga (CC I, 467a"'). "The Mankhatika
in Zacharie's edition contains also a quotation from Medini, which
if.genuine would push back Medini's date to the 12th century for
that commentary was most probably written before the last quarter
of the 12th century."
2. In chapter I of Nidānasthāna (p. 5 of Kinjavdekar's Edition )
we find the following reference :-

to the A. hradya in his commentary. This reference, therefore,
would justify us in concluding that Indu flourished after Vägbhata
II, say after about 900 A. D. and consequently it is absurd to
make him a pupil of Vāgbhata I as the $277 strat does according to
to the statement of the Editor of the Trichur Edition of Indu's
commentary.
In dealing with the properties of the different vegetables
(p. 61 of Sūtrasthāna ) Indu observes:-
"अनशाकाना हरितकानां च येषां नामानि नोक्तानि तेषां देशभाषादिवियो-
धिगण्यापभ्रंशसंस्कारादुपयोगविशेषाच्च शातव्यानि "

"येन हृदये पठति - "तदेव व्यक्ततां यातं रूपमित्यभिधीयते" इति । एवं च 'स्थिते
से पूर्वरूपा: कफपित्तमेहाः' इति यदा हृदयग्रन्थे व्याख्यायते तत्रैव चोदयिष्यामः"
On p. 25 (chap. Vof Sutrasthāna) Indu observes :-
" क्रमश्च 'पादनापथ्यमभ्यस्तम्' इत्यादिना वक्ष्यते " The Editor points out
that the line "क्रमश्च......अभ्यस्तम्" is only a part of the following
whole stanza of the अष्टांगहृदय ( Sutrasthāna, VII, 48)-
"पादेनापथ्यमभ्यस्तं पादपादेन वा त्यजेत् ।
निषेवत हितं तद्वदेकद्वित्र्यन्तरीकृतम् ॥"
These references leave no doubt that Indu was conversant with
the 3TETTE Tafear of Vägbhata II and perhaps he wrote a commentary
on it ("यदा हृदयग्रन्थे व्याख्यायते तत्रैव चोदयिष्याम:'"). We shall have to in-
vestigate if any Mss of Indu's commentary on the 69499 can be
traced anywhere in India. The Triennial Catalogue of Madras M88,
Vol. IV, Part I, Sanskrit B, describes a Ms of अष्टांगहृदयव्याख्या called
शशिलेखा. It is No. R 3447 (p. 5142) and consists of folios 176 in
Malayalam characters. It was transcribed in 1920-21 from a Ms in
the possession, of Mr. M. N. Nambiar, Kaimur village, Trichur,
Cochin State. The Ms begins in 141st stanza of the Sitrasthāna and
contains the Särirasthāna and the Nidānasthāna complete. Judging
by the colophons the Ms appears to be Indu's commentary on the
Aştăngahrdaya. These colophons as recorded in the catalogue read
as follows :-
"इति इन्दुविरचितायामष्टांगहृदयव्याख्या शशिलेखायां त्रिंशोध्यायः ॥ इति सूत्र.
स्थानं समाप्तम् ।।"

In accordance with this statement we find him recording terms

p. 66 — "rarfa 75 tarHafarrai geri arafa alatha arra tal-

As Indu has taken the trouble of noting the terms Current in
Kashmir for particular plants etc., I am inclined to believe that he
either hailed from Kashmir? or was acquainted with a physician in
Kashmir through whom he may have obtained the terminology
recorded above.
Indu in chapter VIII ( Särirasthana, p. 61 ) gives the following
definition of gāmbhīrya guņa:-
"यस्य प्रसादादाकारात् क्रोधशोकभयादयः ।
भावस्था नोपलक्ष्यन्ते तद् गाम्भीर्यमिति स्मृतम् ॥"
1. Vide Introduction, p. xlix of Kalpadru-Kośa, Vol. I ( Baroda,
1928). The oldest of medical and botanical glossaries or Nighantus
is Dhanvantarinighantu, which according to Kșirasvămin is earlier
than Amara. Other nighaņķus are :- Paryāyaratnamālā or Ratna-
mālā of Madhavakara, author of Rugviniscaya - 8th or 9th cent. A. C.
( Winternitz III, 550 ). Paryāya-Muktavali or Muktāvalī is based on
the above work.-Nighanțuśeșa of Hemacandra, Abhidhānaratnamälä,
Madanavinoda (1374 A. D.). Rājani ghaņțu, Sivakośa of Sivadatta
(A. D. 1677), Sabdacandrikā of Cakrapāņidatta, Dakşiņāmūrti-nigh.
anțu, Dravyamuktāvalī and Paryāyārņava.
2. In the TTTTFUTA (chap. XIII, p. 87) under evil dreams refer-
ence is made to "qfarerETETETÉ: ." Indu explains :-"-
द्रविडो दाक्षिणात्यजनपदनामनी" i. e. the terms 'आन्ध्र' and 'द्रविड' are the
names of Southern people or kingdoms. Can this explanation confirm
our suggestion that Indu was a Northerner ?

I have not been able to trace this definition in this form though the
definitions of the gāmbhirya guņa are found in the Nățyaśāśtra' of
Bharata, the Dasarūpaka, the Agnipurānas and other works. Indu
gives the definition of the word FUSTA as follows:- (p. 61 )
"योल्पं दातुं न शक्रोति स्थूललक्षः स उच्यते"
These definitions show the critical nature of his commentary and
justify to a certain extent the boastful statement of verse 6 in the
beginning of the Sūtrasthāna viz." # 4: Agrimagriregar: goertzar-
विषसुप्तस्य वाहटस्य संवित्तिदायिन्यः सन्तु"
We have pointed out above that in commenting on the con-
tents of the pari of the Sütsasthāna (p. 57) Indu states that
paryāyas or synonyms of the names of different plants may be found
in the Nighaņķus (219T: BarSTRAIT... ra). This statement shows
that he was conversant with some medical glossaries containing the
names of the different plants and their synonyms. The question
now arises whether Indu compiled any Nighanțu himself. We
try to record the following evidence for the consideration of
scholars according to which it seems possible that Indu, the author
of the Saśilekha commentary on the Aştāngasaṁgraha and Indu,
the author of a medical Nighanțu frequently quoted by Kșirasvāmins
in his commentary on the Amarakośa may be identical:-

(1) Both the authors have the same name Indu.
(2) While Indu quoted by Kșiraşvāmin is the author of a
Medical Nighanțu , our Indu is the author of the commentary on
a medical work viz the Aștāngasaṁgraha and appears to be con-
versant with medical Nighaņţus, which he says contain the paryayas
or synonyms of the names of plants.
(3) Indu quoted by Kșirasvāmin is evidently earlier than about
1050 A. D. as Kșirasvāmin is assigned to the 2nd half of the 11th
century. Our Indu is also likely to be earlier than A. D. 1050 as
we propose to indicate below.

COMMENTARY OF INDU ON THE AŞTANGASANGRAHA

" एतदेव हृदि कृत्वा भट्टारहरिचन्द्रेण वा शब्दस्य निर्दिष्टस्याप्राधान्यं

(p. 95 ) — HETTEFOI O agrade: gåafari #17: TITET' TFT

भट्टार हरिचन्द्र ( or हरिश्चन्द्र )' referred to in the above extract by
Indu is the author of चरकसंहिताभाप्य. He is quoted by महेश्वर in his
lexicon fany 9277 composed in A. D. 1111, by quote ( about 1000
A. D.) and liy me in his commentary on the strea of Vāgbhata
II. He is also quoted by 378.017 in his commentary on the
HİTE72 composed about 1220 A. D.'. It appears, therefore, that
HER EFTar is earlier than A.D. 1000 and hence Indu's reference to
him does not conflict with our suggestion that Indu, the author of
Sasilekhā may be earlier than 1050 A. D. like his namesake, the
author of a medical Nighantu“ quoted by Kșirasvāmin about
1050 A. D.
The references to Bhattāraka Haricandra made by Indu show
that he had not much respect for the views of Haricandra. This
inference is warranted as Indu observes ( p. 95 - Sūtrasthāna.) -
" HEITO......faidisfa qay giiga: misfaifuatia ge” and
" HEIT&ftar........547RgTÁ.......1279trefaconat Arrigatza." This
criticism of Haricandra by Indu is likely to lead one to suppose
that Indu and Haricandra might have been contemporaries, but we
have at present no evidence either to prove or disprove this
suggestion.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
which appears in the extract from this commentary given in
the catalogue and which contains a contemptuous criticism of
Haricandra' (vide Indu's criticism of Haricandra noted above) it
appears that this unidentified commentary may be Indu's Sasilekha
itself. As, however, the Madras Ms is not before me I am unable
to say anything definitely about this identity, for the question needs
to be settled by a comparison of the Madras Ms with the published
text of the Sašilekhā commentary.
In the following passage Indu appears to refer to his Guru
("अस्मद्गुरवः'') :-
Page 95 ( Sutrasthāna, Chap. IX )-
" एतच्चास्मदगुरवो यथा प्रक्रान्तशब्दार्थपरतन्त्रास्तैरेवेति च तद्विरुद्धानि परा-
मुशन्तो वमनादिवत् पूर्व देहस्याभिसंस्कृतेरपि वैद्यविधेयतामभिमन्यमानाश्चरकस्य

द्वितीयोऽपि पक्षो य उद्भासितः सोऽस्माभिरुपेक्षित एव"
The expression "अस्मद्गुरवः" contains possibly a reference to
Vågbhaţa II, the author of the Aşțāngahrdaya but we must await
more decisive evidence on this possibility.?
1. There is a Ms No. 13092 of Carakasamhitavyākhyå by
Hariscandra in the Govt. Ori. Mss Library, Madras, ( Vide Cata-
logue Vol. XXIII, 1918, p. 8801). It consists of 151 pages and contains
the 3rd adhyaya of the Sutrasthāna. It begins :-
"स्वयम्भवे प्राणभृदन्तरात्मने जगत्प्रदीपाय महद्धितैषिणे ।
. विवस्वते दीप्तसहस्ररदमये सुरोत्तमायामिततेजसे नमः॥"
Colophon of Chap. I -
" इति आचार्यहरिश्चन्द्रकृती प(प्र)शिष्योपाध्यायकोयन्यासे भेषजचतुष्के दीर्घजीवितीयः

2. Pt. Kinjavad ekar has drawn my attention to the following
passage in Indu's comment on Sarirasthāna, Chapter III, (p. 24a) of
his Edition :
"तथा च आचार्य एव हृदये केवलं महत्याः प्रतिषेधं करोति ।
यतः साहोरात्रेण जायत । न तु मात्रान्तरस्य विधानम् ।

COMMENTARY OF INDU ON THE AŞTANGASANGRAHA

References to Indu by subsequent medical writers' have not
(Continued from previous page)
'सूतिका क्षद्वती तलाद घृताद्वा महता पिबेत्'
इति स्नेहे काय वा पीते यमकाभ्यक्तदेहाया वस्त्रेणोदर घेष्टयेत्'
This passage connects आचार्य and अष्टांगह दय because the line
"सृतिका क्षुद्वती......पिबेत् " quoted by Indu is found in the following verse
of the अष्टांगहृदय of Vagbhata II (शारीरस्थान, chapter I) (p. 160 of Kinja-
vdekar's Edition, where the text of शारीरस्थान of the अ. हदय is repro-
duced for reference):-
"सतिका शुद्धता तलादघृताद्वा महती पिबेत् ।
१नकोलकिनो मात्रां मन चोष्णं गडोदकम ।। ९४ ॥"
This identification appears to indicate that Indu claimed Vág-
bhata II, the author of अष्टांगहृदय, as his " आचार्य " and hence by the
expression "अस्मद्गुरवः" mentioned above he refers possibly to Vag.
bhata II.
If our interpretation of the above passages is correct Indu he.
comes a direct pupil of Vāgbhata II and hence a junior contemporary
of his आचाय or "गुरव :" as he respectfully refers to him.
In addition to the references made by Indu to Vāgbhata II in
the words आचाय and गुरव: the following reference to वाहटग्रन्थ appears
to refer to अष्टांगहृदय of Vagbhata II ( P. 1023 of Sutrasthāna,
chap. IX):-
Vagbhata I -A. Saigraha -
"हाद्वसन्ते तस्यान्ते पक्षात्तद्वदनादये।
सेवेत कामतः कामं हेमन्त शिशिरे बली ॥ ९७॥"
Indu's comment :--- " वसन्त यहान्नारा व्रजेत् । तस्य वसन्तस्यान्त ग्राम
पश्चात्तद्वत् घनोदये वर्षा सु हेमन्ते शिशिरे च, बली चलवान् , कामतो यथेच्छं सेवत। शर्गद
त्वनुक्तावपि वसन्तसह शबलादिमत्त्वाद्यहादेव नारी व्रजेत्। तथा च श्रीवाहटग्रन्थ एव
'यहा'द्वसन्तशरदोः इति "
Vagbhata I has omitted TIC or autumn in his list of seasons
mentioned in verse 97 quoted above. Indu suggests that the omission
is not intentional and quotes in his support the line "व्यहाद्वसन्तशरदो"
from वाहटग्रन्थ which appears to be identical vith हदयग्रन्य or अष्टांगहृदय
of Vāgbhața II who has included the 77 in his list of seasons con-
genial for sexual intercourse. By TFI in the above comment Indu
possibly means Vägbhața II and not Vāgbhața 1. The two arats are
here distinguished as one is quoted in support of another.
1. One इन्दु is quoted in the करलाव्याच्या on the अष्टांगहृदय in the
following::---

yet been recorded and consequently it is difficult to fix the lower
limit for Indu's date in a definite manner. That Indu flouri-
shed after Vägbhata II ( 8th or 9th century) is amply proved by his
references to ETTİ? in the Sašilekhā. If, however, his identity
with Indu, the author of the medical Nighanțu quoted by Kșira.
svāmin ( 1050 A. D.) as suggested tentatively by me' in the present
paper is proved conclusively we may be able to assign him to a
period say between A. D. 750 and 1050.

1. I am happy to find that my friend Mr. Nalininath Das Gupta
( Indian Culture, Vol. III, p. 434) has already suggested this
identity :-“An author of a medical Nighanțu or glossary, Indu hy
name is quoted not a few times by Kșirasvāmi attributed to the 2nd
half of the 11th century in his reputed commentary on the Amara-
kośa. The Nighantu appears to have been lost but the name Indu
is found to have been borne by a commentator of the Aștārgahrdaya
of Vägbhața II. A Ms of Indu's commentary entitled Śaśilekha, and
perhaps the only one preserved, is in the Madras Government Collec-
tion (Triennial Catalogue, Madras, Vol. IV, Part I, Sanskrit B, p. 5142).
That both the books are medical and that Indu is not a common.
place name amongst the Vaidyaka writers of ancient and early
mediæval India tend to suggest that Indu, the author of the
Nighantu is the same as the Commentator of the Aşțångahşdaya.
But Indu is after all, a familiar name to us as being that of the
father of Madhavakara, the celebrated author of the Nidāna.
samgraha and it may not improbably be that the writer of the above
two works was but Indu, the father of Mādhava-Kara”. As Mr. Das
Gupta assigns Māhava-Kara to the "Seventh Century' his father
(Continued on next page )

COMMENTARY OF INDU ON THB AŞTANGASANGRAUA

Prof. Keith' regards the Așțārgahrdaya Samhită of Vāgbhata II
as probably the work of a Buddhist. We have suggested earlier in
this paper that Indu was most probably the disciple of Vägbhata II
as he refers to him as praraj” and “yra: ." If this position is
accepted it is easy to understand the following passage in Indu's
commentary:~
Vāgbhaſa I in the Sütrasthāna (chap. IV, p. 20) gives the
following salutary advice:---
" सत्वाद्यवस्था विविधाश्च तास्ताः
सम्यक् समीक्ष्यात्महितं विदध्यात् ।
अन्योऽपि यः कश्चिदिहास्ति मार्गः
fgaigdag nga pall".
Indu explains the above verse as follows:
"सत्वरजस्तमसा नानाविधानवस्थाविशेषान् परीक्ष्यात्महितं करणीयम् । दुस्तरा हि
धर्मप्रतिबन्धका रजस्तमोविकाराः । तथा मनुवुद्धादिप्रणीतेषु हितोपदेशशास्त्रेषु यो
मार्गोऽस्ति तमपि सेवेत'
It will be seen from the above text and its explanation by Indu
that though in the text there is no suggestion of Buddhist philosophy
or religion Indu specifies the text reference to 3774 ani by explain-
ing it to refer to मनुप्रणीतशास्त्र or बुद्धप्रणीतशास्त्र. This specification
can be properly explained if we regard Indu as the pupil of a
Buddhist, though himself embracing the Hindu faith. This tolerance
to Buddhism engendered by his reverence towards a Buddhist guru
looks quite natural. Vägbhata I, however, includes thatratto
among 108 auspicious things? which have nothing to do with
Buddhist religion.
.... .
(Continued from previous page)
Indu, ( as suggested by Mr. Das Gupta above ) will have to be assigned
to the 7th Century'. As against Sth or Oth Century for Vägbhata II
suggested by Dr. Hoernle Mr. Das Gupta suggests 7th Century at the
latest for Vāgbhata II ( Vide Vol. III (1929) p. 795 of History of Indian
Medicine by Girindranath Mukharjee ). This line of argument will
make Indu, his son Mādhava-Kara and l'âgbhața II as contem.
porary writers of the 7th Century. Further as Indu criticizes
Bhattāraka Haricandra in his Sašilekhā Haricandra also may be a
contemporary of Indu or some-what earlier than Indu. All these are,
llowever, probabilities, which need to be verified by specialists in
the field.

25. Date of Kedārabhatſa's Výttaratnākara-
Before A. D. 1297 F
Dr. Keith states in his History of Sanskrit Literature that
Kedārabhatta's Vittaratnākara which describes 136 metres was
written before the 15th century and that Mallinātha uses this work.
Aufrecht states that a commentary on the l’ttaratnākara by
Nārāyaṇabhatta was composed in A. D. 1545.
The date of Mallinātha, according to Prof. Handiqui is "the
15th century or the latter portion of the 14th as he wrote a commen-
tary on Vidyādhara's. Ekávali in the first quarter of the 14th century."4
As Mallinātha uses the I'rttaratnākarı we shall have to put
the date of Vrttaratnākara earlier than the “ latter portion of the
14th century" i. e. earlier than A. D. 1375.
It is proposed in the present note to push the date of the
Vyttarainākara as far back as the 1st half of the 13th century i.e. by
about 125 years or so on the basis of the following evidence:-
Candūpandita, one of the earliest commentators on the Naisa-
dhacarita mentions Vịttaratnākara in commenting on verse 76 of
Canto X. His comment reads ---
" वृत्तरत्नाकरे च द्वितीयाध्यायोक्तया जास्या तृतीय चतुर्थपञ्चमोक्तेन वृत्तेन

Canļūpandita gives his own date viz. Samvat 1353 or A. D. 1297.'
This reference enables us to push back the date of Vịttaratnākara
as far back as A. D. 1250 or roughly the 1st half of the 13th century.
The popularity of this work will be apparent from the fact that
not less than 20 commentaries have been written on itº and that
numerous copies of the work are extant in a manuscript form in
different Manuscript libraries of the world.
1. See my note in the Journal of the Mythic Society ( April 1928)

date of composition of Candū's commentary.

26. Date of Kedārabhatța's Vịttaratnākara
-- Before A. D. 1000 1 .
In my note on the Date of Kedārabhațța's Vịttaratnākara,' a
popular work on Sanskrit prosody, I tried to prove that the work
was composed before A. D. 1250 in view of its being mentioned in
Candūpandita's commentary on the Naisadhacarita (A. D. 1297 ).
Subsequent to the publication of my note I have come across the
following quotation from the work in Aruņadatta's commentary
called Sarvāṇgasundarū? on the Astāngahrdaya of Vāgbhata II :-
Page 235 — “AITHË ATHENTIFAH ( Hi Flat:)"3 (97-
praraat 37. 3127)
Page 236 -- "fa fawfiqahre at vi” ( FATRATER 4 sy. 8188 ).
If the identification of these references as given by the learned
Shastri is correct, we can push back the date of Kedārabhatta's
Vịttaratnākara to 1200 A. D., if not earlier.
According to Dr. Hoernle5 Aruņadatta flourished about 1220
A. D. and if we presume his reference to the V?ttaratnākara as
identified by the editor of the Sarvārgasundarā commentary as

correct we may safely conclude that this work on prosody was
composed earlier than 1150 A. D. Prof. Keith' states that the
Vyttaratnākara of Kedārabhatta was composed before 15th century,
while according to the evidence recorded in the present and earlier
notes of mine it appears that the work must have been composed
before 12th century, if not earlier. This work deals with 136 metres
and is commented on by not less than 20 commentators as pointed
out by me in my previous note on the subject.
Further evidence on the date of the Vịttaratnākara is furnished
by the commentary of Somacandra, which was composed in Samvat
1329 ( = A. D. 1273 )2 as recorded by the author in a verse at the
close of his commentary. The Govt. Mss Library at B. (). R.
Institute, Poona, possesses a Ms of this commentary (No. 349 of
1884-86) but it does not contain the date of composition found
recorded in the Ulwar Ms described by Peterson. Somacandra
mentions llemacandra on folio 17 of the B, 0. R. I. Ms referred to
above:-
" श्रुतिसुखकृदियमपि जगति
निजशिरउपगतवतिसति भवति खजा ।
शिखालक्षणे व्यत्ययरचिते खजा नाम छंदो भवतीति समासार्थः ।।

तिमिर निकरमतनुमपिगुरुणि . . . . . . . .किरणततयइव विदधति चिरतरमवनिपति-
fanaatiafarar: ll ll ctc.”.
It appears from the above extract that Hemasūri or Ilema-
candra has in one of his works dealt with the two lines of the
I'rttaratnākara viz. "Siaga etc, "and “F T etc.” as stated by
1. History of Sanskrit Literature ( 1928 ), p. 417.
2. Vide Extract 24.5 in Peterson's Catalogue of Ulwar Mss, p. 89.
Somacandra records the date of his work in the following verse :-
___ "श्रीविक्रमनृपकाले नन्दकर पीटयोनिभूसंख्ये संवत् १३२९ समजनिरजोत्सवदिने
zraftiYTETTEKT II 11".
The above date of Somacandra's commentary on the Vșttaratnā-
kara has been included in the Chronology of Indian Authors by Nila-
mani Chakravarti published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal, Vol. III ( 1907), pp. 204-220. This is a supplement to M.
Duff's Chronology of India and will be found very useful to students
interested in Indian Chronology.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Somacandra. If this statement proves true on identification we
may be in a position to push back the date of the Vșttaratnākara
before 1000 A. D., for the reason that Hemacandra' flourished
between 1088 and 1172 A. D.
Later references to the Vịttaratnākara especially in works,
the chronology of which has been settled, 'will be found useful as
they will show the authoritative character of the work. Hemādri,
the author of a commentary on the Raghuvamsa, who is different
from his namesake the author of Ayurvedarasāyana and Caturva-
rgacintāmaņi, quotes the l’yttartanākarawhile commenting upon
Raghuvarśa VI, 6. I have proved elsewhere that Hemādri, the
author of the Raghuvarśadar paņa, flourished in the 1st half of the
15th century. Mr. Nilamani Chakravarti in this Chronology of
Indian Authors4 records the following information about Rāma-
candra Bhārati's commentary on the l'șttaratnākara composed in
A. D. 1455 :--
“A. D. 1455 — One thousand ninehundred and ninety-nine years
after the Nirvāņa of Buddha ( according to Ceylonese calculation )
Rāmacandra Bhārati composed a commentary on the l'ęttaratnākara.
The author, who was a Bengal:Brāhmaṇa, went to Ceylon ; converted
by Parākrama Vāhu VI (A. D. 1410-1462 ) and was surnamed
Bauddhāgama Cakravartin. He was an adept to the Mahāyāna
School, a form of Buddhism, says Prof. Bendal, almost unknown

In response to the request of the learned editor ( Vaidya Hari
Shastri Paradkar Bhişagācārya of Akola) of the present edition of the
Astāngahrdaya Samhitā I have collected in this short introduction
some inforniation about lāgbhata the author of this popular work
on medicine. Incidentally I have recorded all possible information
in a brief manner about the commentators of this work to enable
the reader to understand the work of this author in its proper
historical perspective. In the preparation of this introduction my
outlook has been mainly bistorical rather than technical as I don't
claim any knowledge of the practical side of Indian Medicine as
represented in the present work. Further, my introduction is
intended to indicate the present stage of research connected with
the authorship, history and chronology of the Astāngahrdaya and
its cominentators and consequently I liave consistently refused to
be dogmatic on these matters, some of which are still in an unset-
tled state. With these preliminary reinarks about the method
adopted by me in the following study I proceed with the subject

author of which is another TTH2, sometimes called by the Indian
commentators as "gap7372'' or 17Hz, the elder. Dr. Hoernle
names ववाग्भट as वाग्भट I, while the author of the अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता is
styled by him as वाग्भट II. The अष्टांगहृदयसहिता is based on the
sinóst' and reproduces it copiously.
In the latter work 91742 I has tried to gather and amalgamate
tle more or less conflicting medical systems current in his time,
especially those of चरक and सुश्रुत.

( 1902), Introcluction p. XIII --"Tāgbhata, the epitomiser of Charaka
and Suśruta mentions the works of Harita and Bhela, which were
probably extant in his days." Burnell's Tanjore Catalogue, pt. I,
pp. 63-65, contains a full analysis of Bhelasamhitā. Dr. Burnell
remarks: "The most superficial coniparison shows how much Vāg-
bhata was indebted to this ancient work.” Page xvi — "The Charaka,
the Suśruta and the Bower US and even the Astāriyahıdaya of Vāg-
bhaga have more or less a common lasis or substratum.''
Page xviii -" Vāgbhața in his Așļārgahțdaya makes copious
extracts both from the Charaka and the Suśruta. The latter must,
therefore, have existed prior to the 9th century A. D. ......... The
Vägbhata and the Nidāna ( of Madhavakara ) are simply summaries of
Charaka and Susruta and were written at a time when the latter had
become very old and were, therefore, studied by few experts and
their abstracts were likely to be prized by the general practitioners."
In the 2. D.M.G., Vol. 49, p. 184, Roth observes- "Udoy Chand
Dutt in his Mate. Medica describes the work as a methodical and
orderly compilation from Charaka and Suśruta. I believe he is
unjust to him ; Vāgbhața, who, of course, draws upon Suśruta more
is not so dependent" (trans. from German hy my friend Dr. Hara
Datta Sharma, M. A. Ph. D.).

Though aTTHz II is known to all the medical men of India
and his compendium of medicine and surgery ( the STEITECT) is
widely studied by well-known medical practitioners, yet, not
much information is available about his time, place and personality.
Some say that he is Trajatt hinself. He is identified by some
with one of the fourteen gems obtained when the ocean was
churned. In the sparkar he is described as the great sage of the
Kaliyuga.' Others regard him as the incarnation of PTAUT.
There is also a story current which describes him as a voluptuous
Brahmin given to all sorts of revelries and lost in love with a low-
caste woman. The medical writers like माधव, शाम घर, चक्रदत्त and
Hrafast look upon apThe II as a great authority.?
Mr. Kunte records the following evidence to prove that a IRITZ
II was not a Buddhist:-
(1). Though some of the opening salutations to the divisions
of the 370İTETTditar are addressed either to Buddha or some
Buddhistic emblem we need not infer therefrom that 71742 II was
of Buddhistie persuasion because three-fourts of these opening
salutations are addressed to गजानन,
(2). In one place THC II shows his aversion to Buddhas and
says--" i toga", where the meaning of pet is explained by the
commentators as “Buddha temple” or the “place of worship of the
Buddhas."
(3). In his precepts for the preservation of health anh II is
a thorough Vedic Iryan and the Haars he recites are also l'edic.
For all the foregoing reasons Mr. Kunie thinks that apTH II
lived more under the Vedic than under Buddhistic or Brahmanical
polity.
: “ Though a Vedic Arya, Vägbhata was influencod considerably
by the teachings of Gautama Buddha. He seems to have flourished
when Buddhism had asserted its power while that of the Vedas had
not totally declined.''

Mr. Ganesh Sharma in the sपोद्घात to his edition of the अष्टांग.
संग्रह of वृद्धवाग्भट ( p. 1 ) observes:---
"बुद्धाय तस्मै नमः' इत्याधुकत्वाद्वाग्भटो बौद्धमतानुयाय्यासीदिति केषा-
चिन्मतम् तस न सम्यक् यतः " अर्चयेदेव गोविप्रवृद्धवैद्यनृपातिथीन् ॥ अथर्वविहिता

अर्थपरस्वारच वाग्भटो दिकधर्मानुयायी ब्राह्मण आसीन बौद्धमतानुयायीत्यधिगम्यते ॥"
As regards the parentage of apuz II Mr. Kunte says it will
be found in the last chapter of the उत्तरसंत्र of the अष्टांगसंग्रहसंहिता.
The pertinent verse reads as under:-
“भिपग्वरो वाग्भट इत्यभून्मे
पितामही नामधराऽस्मि यस्य ।
सुतोऽभवत्तस्य च सिंहगुप्त.
स्तस्याप्य सिंधुषु जातजन्मा ॥" 2
“My grand-father's nanie was ap:32, was given his name, my
father was सिंहगुप्त, I was born in this country of the Sindhus."
Evidently in assigning the above parentage to the author of the
अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता AIr. Kunte has presumed the identity of the author
of the अष्टांगसंग्रह viz. वाग्भट ], and the author of the अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता
viz. वाग्भट II. This identity may be wrong in view of the fact pointed
out by Dr. Hoermle that वाग्भट II has based his work (अष्टांगहृदय-
संहिता) on that cf वाग्भट ] or वृद्धवाग्भट (अष्टांगसंग्रह ). Then again on
p. 8 of his Introduction which contains Marathi translation of his
remarks in English about a route's parentage he has wrongly substi-
tuted the words "अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता'' instead of "अपांगसंग्रहसंहिता' the
last chapter of which contains the verse "भिषग्वरो वाग्भट इत्यभूत्......
सिंधुषु जातजन्मा' as verified by us in the reference given by us in the
foot-note from the edition of the अष्टांगसंग्रह of 1888. No edition of
the अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता contains the verse in question.
1. Is this in अटांगसंग्रह or अटांगहृदय ? Mr. Kunte says it is in the
अष्टांगहृदय. Perhaps Mr. Ganesh Sharma (1888) has based his remarks
on Kunte's remarks of 1880).

Mr. Kunte also quotes the popular couplet describing Vāgbha-
ța's power and proficiency:-
"facra A1977: Ste: apa a ITHI: 1
Tri Fa: 91: T arafarena 11"
As Mr. Kunte has presumed the identity of the two his he
apparently makes the above verse applicable to apTHz, the author of
the 3DİETTRIFAT. The couplet, however, is not clear on this point
and it is doubtful whether by “qpH7"' the couplet means apud I
(or TITHI ) or arsHZ II, who has based bis treatise on that of
arritz I. This question can be solved if we can prove the antiquity
of the couplet quoted by Mr. Hunte.
The colophons to the different chapters of the 39İNETTET
of FTTH II are also misleading as regards the parentage of the
author. For instance the colophon to the forma on p. 850 of
Vol. I of Kunte's edition of 1880 reads as under:-
" इति श्रीसिंहगुप्त सूनुवाग्भटविरचितायां अष्टांगहृदयसंहितायां तृतीयं निदान-
स्थानं समाप्तम्"
The “सिंहगुप्तसूनुवाग्भट" is evidently identical with वृन्द्र वाग्भट, the
author of the अष्टांगसंग्रह and not of the अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता and the copyists
in copying the MSS of the two works by authors of the name TruZ
may have indiscriminately added the expression ETAFZ' to the
name of THE II, while in fact there is no verse in the body of thic
अष्टांगहृदयसंहिता supporting this parentage' for वाग्भट ]I.
1 This parentage ( 741) is also found in the case of the
author of the 77977 which is also ascribed to aliita in the Colo-
phons of MSS of this work (cf. India Office MS. No. 2175 - Des.
Cata. Part V, p. 967). In the indroductory verses of this work
verse 9 clearly states that the author of the thr3997 is the son of
Simhagupta ( Tophat) :-
" रसानामामयन्नानां चिकित्सार्थापयोगिनां ।
har fåetata Tataagaag: 11 811".
( Vide p. 967 of Part V Ind. Office Cata. ). .
If the above verse is a genuine part of the text we get three
वाग्भटs with the same parentage (सिंहगुप्तसूनु ) ---- a circumstance which

Prof. Keith,' however, makes the following remarks about
these two वाग्भटs :-
(1) “Both claim the same parentage in their works."
(2) "वृद्धवाग्भट is the son of सिंहगुप्त and grand-son of वाग्भट and his
teacher was the Buddhist Avalokita.”
(3) The work of agarh was clearly used by the younger writer
( author of STDİTTEST fear) whose Metrical form as contrasted with
the prose mixed with verses of his predecessor (azanH2 ) confirms
his later date.
(4) T 1932 was clearly a Buddhist and he may reasonably be
identified with a man referred to by I-tsing as the author of a com-
pendium of the eight topics of medicine.
(5) बाहट is the Prakrta form of वाग्भट and संघगुप्त is the Prakrta
form for ima.
(6) The younger arThe was very possibly a descendant of the
older (
qarT72) though we have no proof for such a conjecture
beyond the fact that it might explain their confusion.
(7) The girecTaigar was probably the work of a Buddhist.
It was translated into Tibetan and it could not be put more than a
century after the STEITÉHE.
(8) Both the वाग्भटs agree in citing चरक and सुश्रुत.

in itself is highly suspicious and raises doubts about the authenticity
of this parentage ascribed to no less than three authors of the same
name. According to Sir P. C. Ray the TRUFETU is contemporaneous
with Roger Bacon who died in A. D. 1294 ( Vide p. lvi of History of
Hindu Chemistry, vol. I, Calcutta, 1902). If this view is correct the
author of the TH2745074 cannot be identical with the author of the
STETTETU inspite of the alleged identity of name and parentage.
Mr. Durgashankar Kevalaram Shastri expresses the same view
as above against the traditionally accepted view about the identity of
the three Vägbhațas ( Vide foot-note 31 on p. 258 of Prabandha
Chintāmani, Gujarati Trans. Bombay, 1934).

Dr. P. C. Ray' regards Vāgbhata, the author of the Aşfångahy.
daya as the highest medical authority next to Caraka and Susruta.
"In many parts of the Deccan the very names of Caraka and Susruta
were forgotten and Vāgbhata is looked upon as a revealed author
and this is one of the reasons which led Haas to conclude that the
former succeeded and owed their inspiration to the latter."'?
The Aștāngahrdaya contains little or nothing that is original.
It is merely an epitome of the Caraka and the Susruta with some
gleanings from the works of Bhela and Hārita. In surgery alone
the author introduces certain modifications and additions. Mineral
and natural salts chiefly figure in the prescriptions along with
vegetable drugs; mercury is incidentally mentioned but in such a
perfunctory manner that it would not be safe to conclude that any
compounds thereof are referred to. There are, however, a few
metallic preparations recommended in it which would presuppose
an advanced knowledge of chemical processes."
Regarding the religious faith of Vāgbhata Dr. Ray observes :-
"There is a tradition current among the learned Pandits of Southern
India that lāgbhața, formerly a Brahmin, was persuaded by a Buddha
priest to adopt his religion which he embraced in the latter part of
his life.'
The internal evidence also fully supports our author's procli-
vities towards Buddhism."
Date of Vāgbhața II
The Chinese pilgrim l'tsing speaks of a compiler of the eight
divisions of the Ayurveda :--"''l hese eight parts formerly existed in
eight books, but lately a man epitomised them and made them
into one bundle.'!"

Vägbhața, the author of the Așțārgahrdaya, presuming that l'tsing
alludes to Vāgbhata II in the foregoing lines.
Dr. P. Cordier thinks that Vāgbhata lived at the time of king
Jayasimha ( 1196-1218 A. D.) on the authority of the Rājatarangini
but this view is untenable as observed by Dr. Ray because Kalhana's
dates are not always reliable.
“Cosma de koros was the first to announce that the Thibetan
Tanjur contains among others, translations of the Charaka, the
Susruta and the Vāgbhata." !
“ George Huth who has critically examined the contents of the
Tanjur concludes that the most recent date at which this Tanjur
can be placed is Sth century A. D. This is in agreement with the
fact that the Vāgbhata was one of tlie medical works translated by
order of the Caliphs. But no positive information as regards the
most distant date is yet available.' Kunte from internal evidence
is inclined to place him at least as early as the second century
before Christ.”
According to Dr. Hoernle“ Vāgblata II or the author of the
Aşțāngahrdaya belongs to 8th or 9th century A. D. At any rate he
is not later than 1060 A. D., the date of Cakrapāņidatta.
The grounds on which Dr. Hoernle bases his chronology for
Vāgbhata Il may be briefly stated as under:-
(1) Vāgbhata I, according to Dr. Hoernle may be assigned to
early seventh century or about 625 A. D.'
(2) Mūdhava, Drdhabala and l'âgbhata Il are all of them poste-
rior to Vāgbhata I.

(3) Madhava cites Vägbhata by name' and also quotes from him
anonymously. Dưdhabala, though he does not name Vāgbhata I as
his authority, quotes from him very frequently.?
(4) Mādhava, Drdhabala and Vägbhața II are anterior to
Cakrapāņidatta whose date is about 1060 A. D.
Cakrapāņidatta names Dědhabala and quotes him as the author
of the last section (fert Ferat ) of Caraka's compendium". Vägbhata
II is quoted many times by name in Cakrapāņidatta's commentary
on Caraka's compendium.
Mādhava is anterior to Cakrapāņidatta as he precedes both
Dşdhabala and Vāgbhața II. These three authors, according to Dr.
Hoernle, must be placed somewhere between the 7th and 11th
centuries A. D.
(5) According to evidence collected by Prof. Jolly? the
Arabic sources point to 7th or Sth century for Madhava and the
Tibetan and other sources point to 8th or 9th century for Vägbhaja
11.8 Dşdhabala takes his place between Madhava and Vågbhata II.
In any case none of these authors ( Mādhava, Drdhabala and
Vāgbhata II ) can be later than c. 1060 A. D., the date of Cakra-
pānidatta.

II ... COMMENTARIES ON THE AŞTĀNGAHRDAYA
OF VÁGBHAȚA
The popularity of the Aşļāngahțdaya as a work of highest
medical authority next to Caraka and Suśtuta found for it many
commentators of repute. Many MSS of their commentaries are
now available in several public libraries in India and outside. It
** would, however, be useful to record here a complete list of these
commentaries and the MS material available with regard to each of
them in the different libraries :-

Part I, p. 36 -- Peters. 2, 86 -- Peterson does not record any MS but
only mentions that Asādhara wrote a commentary called Uddyota
on Vägbhata's Aşțāngahrdaya. This commentary is one of the
eleven works of Aſādhara recorded by Peterson. A. was a Jain teacher
who lived in A. D. 1240 ( = Saivat 1296). His native country was
Sapädalakshaya. Owing to this country being overrun by Mleccha
King, A. ran for safety to Mālavā and took refuge in Dhårå,
where he was received with enthusiasm by (the lord of poets )
Bilhaņa, the chief minister of Vijayavarma, the king of Mālavă. The
foregoing information is recorded in a valuable praśasti to the
Dharmāmta of Aśādhara, 2 MSS of which are available in the Govt.
MSS library at the B.O. R. Institute. Peterson calls Asadhara as
"Jain admirable Crichton."
As Āsādhara was a very learned commentator and was
apparently a senior contemporary of Hemādri (about 1260 A. D.) his
commentary on the Aştāngahşdaya must have been a valuable one.
Aufrecht, however, records no MSS of this commentary. If any
MSS are found they will prove a valuable addition to the commen-
tarial literature on the Așțāngahrdaya.

of this commentator is stea ( see Cordier in Journ. Asia. 1901,

Of the ten commentaries mentioned above we are concerned
at present with those of Arunadatta and Hemådri which have been
printed in this edition along with the text of the Aștāngahydaya.
Several editions of the text have been published but the commentaries
on the same with the exception of that of Aruņadatta have not been
published so far. In the present edition Pt. Paradkar Shastri of
Akola has included the unpublished commentary of Hemādri with
different readings of the text and both the commentaries from
20/25 MSS procured from different places. The readings of the
text ( Aşļāngahțdaya sanhita ) have been carefully checked and veri-
fied by him with reference to the text of the Carakasamhita,
Suśrutasamhita and Așțărigasamgraha. The text of Hemādri's
commentary on the Nidānasthāna and the Cikitsästhāna of the
Aştangahſdaya has been based only on a single rare MS procured
with great difficulty by Pt. Paradkar Shastri. A close student of the

Pt. Paradkar Shatri has tried his best to make the present
edition as much scholarly as possible. All students of the history
of Indian Medicine should, therefore, be grateful to him and the
N. S. press for bringing out the present edition involving much
scholarly labour and expense.
Aruņadatta
Aruņadatta was the son of Mșgānkadatta.' Mr. Nalini Nath
Das Gupta® includes this commentary on the Aşțângahrdaya
among the Vaidyaka works of Bengal in the Early Mediaeval period
and observes :- “Probably to the early part of the thirteenth
century belonged Arunadatta, son of Mrgänkadatta and the author
of a learned commentary on the Ašțargahrdaya of Vāgbhata II.
A commentary on the Suśruta Samhitā is also ascribed to him
( Cata. of Sans. MSS in the Private Libraries of the N. W. Prov.
part I, Benares, 1874, 586 ). An Aruņadatta is found quoted, as a
lexicographer and grammarian in Bșhaspati Rāyamukuța's commen-
tary on the Amarakośa ( 1431 A. D.) (R. G. Bhandarkar's Report on
Search of Sanskrit MSS, 1883-84, p. 467) as also in the ſ'ikāsarvasva
commentary on the same by Sarvānanda-Vandyaghațiya (1159 A.D.),
but whether he is not different from the physician Aruņadatta is
very difficult to divine at present. One of the theories of the
latter, however, regarding the structure of the eye is controverted
by Vijaya-Rakşita (c. 1240 A.D. ) whence Dr. Hoernle assigns him to
about 1220 A. D. (Hoernle: Studies in the Medicine of Ancient
India, Part I ( Osteology ), p. 17).”
Aufrecht' records the following namesakes of Arunadatta:-
1. The colophons of the different chapters of the commentary
record the name
(cf. HÆTT&TITAT FUradiaargt extr.
121 PTT) while in verse 3 of chapter I of his commentary he gives
his father's name as ITT:
" श्रीमन्मृगाङ्कतनयष्टीकामष्टाङ्गहृदयस्य ।
श्रीमानरुणः कुरुते सम्यग्द्रष्टुः पदार्थबोधाय ॥३॥"

As Ujjvaladatta's Vịtti on the Uņādisűtras of Pāṇini has been
assigned by Aufrecht' to circa 1250, Arunadatta, the lexicographer
and grammarian must have flourished before A. D. 1250.
The question of the identity of the namesakes of Arunadatta is
still a matter for investigation and the only fact about which we are
certain is that three persons of the same name viz. Aruņadatta,
wrote on four different subjects viz. Medicine, Lexicography,
grammar and architecture.
The relative chronology of Arūnadatta and two of his successors
who were not far removed from him in point of time has been
given by Dr. Hoernle on evidence which is as follows:-
(1) Vācaspati wrote a commentary called Atarka Darpara
(i.e. Mirror of Diseases ) on the Nidāna ( Pathology ) of Madhava.
(2) Vijayarakṣita and his pupil Šrikanſhadatta jointly wrote a
commentary called N1adhukosa (Receptacle of Honey) on the
Nidāna of Mādhava:
(3) Vācaspati states in verse 4 of his Introduction to the
Atankadarpaņa that he consulted the Madhukoșa for the purpose
of writing his own commentary.
(4) Vijayarakṣita controverts a certain doctrine of Arunadatta
regarding the structure of the eye (see Atarkadarpana, Uttarasthāna,
chapter xii, verse 1 of 1st Ed. Vol. ii, p. 516 ).
(5) Vācaspati states in verse 5 of his Introduction that his
father Pramoda was chief physician at the court of Muhammad
Hammira, who is identical with the celebrated Muhamad Ghori who
reigned in Delhi from 1193 to 1205 A. D.
(6) Vijayarakṣita quotes Gunākara' who wrote the Yogaratna.

On the basis of the above evidence Dr. Hoernle concludes
that-
(i) Arunadatta Aourished about 1220 A. D.
(ii) Vijayarakṣita e os 1240 A. D.
(iii) Vācaspati , , 1260 A. D.
Hemādri
Hemādri's name is familiar to us on account of his magnum
opus viz. the Caturvargacintāmaņi which Prof. Keith describes as
written between 1260 and 1309 for Yādava princes.” In this
book Hemādri " sets out in enormous detail rules of vows and
offerings, pilgrimages, the attainment of release, and offerings to
the dead. This text is exceptionally rich in Smrti citations in
extenso...''
Aufrecht makes the following entries about Hemādri and his
works in his Catalogue:-
"BATE - Son of Kāmadeva, son of Vāsudeva, son of Vāmana, lived
under king Mahādeva ( 1260.71 ) of Devagiri, son of
Caitrapāla and under his successor Rāmacandra ( 1271-1309 ).
See Pariseşakhaņda, 1, p. 4. He is quoted for the first
time by Vopadeva, then in the Kalamadhava and Madana-
pārijāta.”

This Hemadri is different from महहेमाद्रि, son of ईश्वरसूरि, author

A work called fargeliara on dharma by Hemādri ( AK. 437 ) has
also been recorded by Aufrecht.
In the commentary on the Așțārgahrdaya viz. the Ayurvedara.
sayana, Hemādri gives in the first nine verses some information?
about himself. He calls himself Hemādri, the autlior of the Catur-
vargacintāmaņi (v. 2). For the proper performance of the vows etc.
mentioned in the Caturvargacintamaņi good health is necessary and

and Canto VII, 37, 51 of the Raghuvamsa, mentions the aggrisarar.
As Bhatta Hemādri quotes from the Prakriyākaumudi of Rāmacandra
( between 1350 and 1400 ) his commentary has been assigned by me to
the first half of the 15th century.
2. See also Early History of India by V. A. Smith (1924),
p. 452 --" The celebrated Sanskrit writer Hemādri popularly known as
Hemādarant tourished during the reigns of Rāmacandra and his
predecessor Mahādeva. He devoted himself chiefly to the systematic
redaction of Hindu religious practices and observances and with this
object compiled important works uson Hindu sacred law. He is alleg-
ed although erroneously to have introduced a form of current script,
the Modi, from Ceylon and has given a valuable historical sketch of
his patron's dynasty in the introduction to one of his books.”

follows the views of earlier medical writers viz. चरक, हारीत, सुश्रत
and others (v. 3). It does not repeat what has already been said
by commentators like this one and others on Caraka and FC and
others on Suśruta ( v 4). Hemādri also mentions his relation
with his patron king Rāmacandra of Devagiri ( verses 5 and 6 ).
It appears from the above account that Hemādri's Ayurveda-
rasāyana is later than his work Caturvargacintāmaņi as the latter is
referred to in the former. This reference gives us the relative chro.
nology of the two works. Prof. P. V. Kane' assigns the composition
of the Caturvargacintāmaņi to a period of ten years (1260 to 1270
A. D.) because in the Caturvargacintāmaņi Henādri is said to be
the keeper of the state records of Mahādeva, who reigned from
1260-1271 A. D. Prof. Kane further observes:-“There are contem-
porary records available showing that Hemādri was in high favour
not only with Mahādeva but also with his successor Rāmacandra."
These remarks receive additional corroboration from the
following two verses in the beginning of the Ayurvedarasāyana:-
“ देशभ्रंशभयाद्विचाल्य लयिनः स्नेहः प्रतापैः परं
प्रद्राव्य प्रसृतान् प्रवेश्य परितो दुर्गोदरं द्राक्ततः ।
ऊर्धाधोगति निर्गमय्य मदनैदन्त्यादिभिर्विद्विषो
दोषानद्रढि रामराज्यमगदकारेण हेमाद्रिणा ॥५॥
हेमाद्रिनाम रामस्य राज्ञः श्रीकरणेष्वधि ।
ननुभौ भगवनिष्ठषाड्गुण्यकरणेवधि ॥ ६ ॥"
The above verses clearly refer to the eminent position Hemd-
dri held under King Rāmacandra of Devagiri ( 1271-1309 A.D.).
Evidently the Ayurvedarasāyana must have been composed between
1271.1309 A. D. when as a minister of Rāmacandra he strived for
the solidarity of the kingdom. The exact date of composition of
the Ayurvedarasäyna must, however, await further investigation,
because no MSS of the complete commentary of Hemādri on all

in the government through the favour of Rāmacandra and as one who
was in charge of all state records and was the foremost minister"

the sthånas of the Aşžāngahrdaya have yet been made available to
the editor of the present edition of the Așțårgahşdaya.
· For more information about Hemādri and the Yādavas of
Devagiri we have to invite the attention of our readers to section
87 of Prof. Kane's History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. I (pp. 354-:59 )
from which the following lines are noteworthy :-
"Hemādri also wrote a commentary called Ayurvedarasāyana.
... Altogether Hemādri was a towering personality. His name is
associated throughout the Maratha country with the construction of
numerous temples having a peculiar style of architecture. He is
Blso credited with having invented the Modi script."
Mr. K. A. Padhye has also publisl.ed a Life of Hemādri'
( in Marathi ) which is replete with information about Hemādri and
his times and can, therelore, be read with profit. In particular
chapter II, which deals with Hemādri's literary productions will be
found interesting. In his remarks about Ayurvedarasāyana (1) Mr.
Padhye refers to Mr. Kunie's statement that Henādri wrote a
commentary on ile Sütrasthāna and Kalpasthāna and then i 2)
throws out a suggestion that some contemporary learned physician
patronized by Hemādri may have written the Ayurvedarasayana.
(3) Mr. Padhye also states that Aruņadatta in his commentary on
the Astaigahrdaya does not refer to Hemādri. With regard to
these remarks of Mr. Padhye we have to observe as follows:--
(1) Tlc present editition of the Astāngahrdaya contains
Hemādri's commentary not only on the Sūtrasthāna and Kalpa-
sthåna but on some portion of the Cikitsästhāna and Nidana-
sthāna also, though it is difficult to find MSS of the commentary
for other sthånas. l'erhaps a thorough search for these MSS will
have to be made before concluding that Hemādri did not complete
his commentary on all the parts of the Așțāngahrdaya. Mr. Kun.
te's statement was obviously made in 1880 on a partial survey of
MSS material for this commentary, when Aufrecht's Catalogus
Catalogorum ( 1891-1903 ) was not available to him.
(2) As Aruņadatta has been assigned to about 1220 A. D. and
as Hemādri flourished between 1260 and 1309 A. D. the absence of
any reference to Hemādri in Aruņadatta's commentary pointed out
by Mr. Padhye is easily explained. On the contrary Hemädri men-

tions Arunadatta ( vide p. 136 – “A
and "AT...'agiaa:'gfa 37501CA:.").
(3) The hypothesis of a learned physician writing the
Ayurvedarasāyana for his patron Hemādri is contradicted by
Hemādri's own statement in the introductory verses of Ayurve-
darasāyana published in the present edition (verses 2 and 8 ) where-
in he clearly states that Hemādri, the author of the Caturvarga-
cintāmaņi composed this commentary on the Așțāngahſdaya and
if Mr. Padhye does not doubt Hemādri's authorship of his work
on Dharmaśāstra he cannot in fairness to the versatile intellect
of Hemādri doubt bis authorship of a work on Vaidyaka. In addi-
tion to the statement regarding authorship made in the introductory
verses we find the following verse at the end of his commentary on
verse 105 of chapter 6 of the Sūtrasthana wl.erein two readings in
the text are discussed quite in the style of a modern textual critic
( page 108 ) ::-
“afw: q7gATART TITTÀI Anjari
हेमाद्रिणा कृता किन्तु तुण्डालुरिति पठयताम् ॥"
Then again at the end of his commentary on different chapters
of the text we find the following statement repeated:-
“gfa hiftTarzăgaigà etc.''
Since this Introduction was written two publications pertaining
to the Aștārgahıdaya have been published. One of these is a
German Translation of the Aşğärgahrdaya Samhitā by Luise
Hilgenburg and Wilibald Kirfel, which is being published in fasci-
cules by the firm of E. J. Brill of Leiden (Holland). Up to now
four fascicules ( pp. I to 256 ) have been published. The Trans-
lators have given at times some Text-Critical notes which may be
useful for a subsequent Critical edition of the Samhitā. - The
other work is 'The Ashtanga Hridaya Kosha by K. M. Vaidya
of Valapad (South Malbar) 1936. This is a Dictionary of technical
terms used in the text of the Așțāngahğdaya Samhită. (For a detailed

BRAHMADBVA'S COMMENTARY ON THE SIDDHAYOGA
193
P. 583 — " Hragi gemaafan ga: SCATTER arufata i fat
stanga:"
P. 599 — "TraspETAARN Arti Tú gaziarafafa auga: "
It appears from the foregoing quotations that a commentary on
the art by a writer of the name gaza was in existence, say,
between A. D. 1250 and 1350 as it is mentioned and quoted from
by either Srikanthadatta or Nārāyaṇabhisaj in the garototie
on it. This commentary has not been mentioned by Aufrecht
and hence it would be worth while tracing quotations from it in
sources prior to Srikanthadatta's time.
Hemādri, the minister of King Rāmacandra of Devagiri (A. D.
1271-1309 ), composed a commentary on the Astāngahệdaya of
Vāgbhata II called the Ayurvedara sāyana,' in which we find the
following reference to gea:-
" आसवस्य सुरायाश्च द्वयोरप्येकभाजने ।
सन्धानं तद्विजानीयान्मैरेयमुभयात्मकम् ।।
gfa JESZT II"
Possibly the author of the name aga quoted from and mentioned
by Hemādri is identical with his namesake, the author of a commen-
tary on the fant mentioned by the authors of the Kusumāvali-
vyākhyā. If this suggestion is accepted we are warranted in con-
cluding that art is earlier than A. D. 1200 or so.
Dallaņa in his commentary on the Sušrutasanhita refers to the
in the following extracts*:--
1. Edited by Hari Shastri Paradkar in his edition of Așţăngahr-
daya, N. S. Press, Bombay, 1939.
2. Ibid., p. 136.

called TUTTATET C. A.D. 1092 ( Saka 1014) (vide p. 240 of History

he is identical with the medical author qua, the subject of the
present paper. Another author a wrote a commentary on the

The foregoing references make it clear that Brahmadeva is
prior to Dallaņa. Hoernle' assigns Dallaņa to 'twelfth century', i. e.
to a period between 1100 and 1200 A. D. We may, therefore, assign
Brahmadeva to a period prior to A. D. 1100. As Brahmadeva
commented the Siddhayoga of Vịnda he is later than Vịnda, whom
Sir P. C. Ray? assigns to circa 900 A. D. We may, therefore,
assign Brahmadeva to a period between c. A. D. 900 and 1100.

-- Before A. D. 1000
Prof. A. B. Keith', speaking of the poems Nalodaya and Rākşasa
Kavya”, observes as follows:-
“Still more ludicrous is the suggestion that Nalodaya is his
( Kālidāsa's ); that rimed poem of intolerable affectation is perhaps
not the production of Ravideva author of the Rākṣasa Kāvya of equal
demerit, before the 17th century but the work of Vāsudeva, protégé

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
I am concerned in the present paper with the chronology of the
Rākṣusa Kavya, irrespective of the question of its authorship and
hence propose to record some data bearing on its chronology. As
Prof. Keith observes that this work is “before 17th century” we
must try to take back this limit as far back as we can take it on the
strength of documentary evidence.
According to Mr. Krishnamachariar?" Raksasa-Kavya is a short
piece of 20 verses in an enigmatic and alliterative style, containing
a description of sylvan scenery around, by a person roaming about
the forest with his spouse. There are commentaries on it by
Premadhara, by Sambhubhāskara, by Kavirāja, by Krsna Candra, by
Udayākaramiśra, and by BālakrsnaPāyagunda.” A study of the
commentaries on the Rākşasa-Kāvya and their chronology would
have given us some limits for the chronology of this Kāvya but
unfortunately the Mssy of these commentaries are not avail-
able to me. Some Mss of these commentaries available at the B.
O. R. Institute“ have been examined by me but they have not

given me any useful data on strength of which any definite limits
for the date of the Rakșasa-Kāvya could be determined with confide-
nce. We are, however, fortunate to have in the Jain Bhandars at Jesal-
mere a unique dated Ms of a commentary on the Räkşasa-Kāvya
copied in Samvat 1215 %= A. D. 1159. This Ms has been described
by Mr. C. D. Dalal in his Catalogue of Jesalmere Mss. The scribe who
wrote the Ms was a pupil of Jinacandra Sūri of the name "Jina-
mata (pati?). Mr. Dalal says that there is possibility of this scribe
himself being the author of this commentary on the Rākşasa-Kavya.'
Be that as it may, the fact that we have a copy made in A. I). 1159
of a commentry on this Rākşasa-Kävya argues in favour of an early
date for this Kāvya and it would be worth while examining the
Jesalmere Ms from the point of view of textual criticism. The
Prasasti which contains the date of the Ms reads as follows:-

The Ms of the 778779570311 described by Mr. Dalal is a Palm-
leaf' Ms in the Big Bhandar at Jesalmere. We have no access to
this Ms and hence must rest content with the extract and the
description of it given by Mr. Dalal. Mr. Dalal describes the Ms
as राक्षसकाव्यटीका and if we have a commentary on the राक्षसकाव्य
copied in A. D. 1159, the date of composition of this commentary
is earlier than A. D. 1159. In the same manner the date of the
राक्षसकाव्य is earlier still and we may presume that it may be earlier
than say A.D. 1000. In view of this limit it would be useful to
record references to the राक्षसकाव्य earlier than say A. D. 1100 or so.
The Government Oriental Mss Library, Madras, contains some
Mss of a poem having the designation afateter. A description

of these Mss has been given in Vol. XX ( Kavyas) of the Descriptive
Catalogue of that Library (1918). It appears from this description
that the platitetu is a poem of 100 stanzas, while the 77877 Toy
consists of 20 stanzas only. I am unable to determine if there is any
connection between the राक्षसकाव्य and the कविराक्षसीय both of which
are represented by some Mss in the several Mss catalogues. It
appears, however, that the refrETTEIT represented by a Ms
of A. D. 1159 in the Jesalmere Bhandar deals with the TT&TTATOU of
20 stanzas only and not with afatetera of 100 stanzas. If this view
is correct we can definitely say that this poem of 20 stanzas was
composed before A. D. 1000 or so in view of a Ms of a commentary
on it copied in A. D. 1159 actually existing at Jesalmere.

poem as Hoffer published and which according to the Ms ( v. B. 4,
No. 580 ) is by Ravideva. The original of this Ms (at Tanjore,
No. 4780 ) attributes it to Kālidāsa but it cannot have been written
more than fifty years ago. So this authority for the statement leaves
room for doubt.” “The Commentary differs from all of those given

della Societa Asiatica Italiana, xix ( 1906 ) 83 - 102, who translates the
poem. With the Ms are four half sheets of notepaper containing
remarks on the style of the poem and the text of verses 1-6 and a
translation of verses 1-4 by Burnell." The colophon.of the Jammu

In view of the data recorded above and in view of the exist-
ence of a Ms of the Rākșasa Kavya commentary copied in A. D.
1159 it is necessary to search for quotations from the extant text of
this poem in works composed earlier than A. D. 1159. It is also
necessary to investigate the question of authorship of the poem,
attributed to Kālidāsa, Vararuci and other writers indiscriminately,
My object in the present paper is to take back the later limit for
the date of the poem from “before the 17th Century'' given by Prof.
Keith to “ before A. D. 1159 ” definitely and " before A. D. 1000”
tentatively. The following chronology about the Mss of the Rākşasa

century.”

Whatever be the evidence on which Mr. Payne has based his
date--"14th century" for the Kālikāpurāņa, it does not affect my
evidence for an earlier date for this work, which I intend to record
in this note. Sivānanda Sarasvati in his work, called the Yogacinia-

maņi,' which is a compilation of texts on yoga, quotes many times
from the Kālikāpurāņa, but as he is a late author this evidence is
not of much value in the present inquiry. The late character of
the Yogacintāmaņi, is proved by its reference to Vidyāraṇya, which
only proves that Sivananda flourished after 1400 A. D. or so.
Better evidence for pushing back Mr. Payne's date for the
Kālikāpurāņa by at least 200 years, if not more, is furnished by the
Caturvargacintāmaņi, a work on Dharmaśāstra compiled by Hemādri,
the minister of the Yādava Kings of Devagiri,* viz., (1 ) Mahādeva
( 1260-1270 ) and his successor (2) (Rāmacandra ( 1271-1309 ). Hemādri
includes in this work many extracts from the Kālikāpurāņa in the
Vratakhanda.5 These extracts are ushered in as from the Kalika-
purāņa as follows:-

which also quotes the Kālikāpurāņa (See Hall's Bibliography of
Indian Philosophical Systems, Calcutta, 1859, pp. 17-18, No. XXXIV).
Hall states that Hathasarketacandrikā is a work by Sundaradeva, son
of Visvanāthadeva. They were of the Kaśyapagotra and were Mara-
hațțas of Benares. Sundaradeva's spiritual guide was one Pūrpā-

-new, to make up his Vratakhanda of the Caturvargacintamani
and we have nothing in the nature of these extracts to challenge
their genuine character. Hemādri's references to and quotations
from the Kālikāpurāna' in the 2nd half of the 13th century dis-
establish Mr. Payne's date "14th century” for it and establish at
the same time an earlier limit for it, viz. the 12th century. At any
rate the work is older than A. D. 1200.
Other evidence in support of the above limit fixed by me for
the date of the Kālikāpurāņa is furnished by a work on Dharma-
śāstra. The Acārādarśa of Sridatta Upādhyāya, a manual of daily
religious duties of the followers of the White Yajurveda ( Vājasane-
yins ), names among other works the Kālikāpurāna.? According
to Prof. Kane', Sridatta “composed his works between 1275 and 1310
A. D.” It is clear, therefore, that he was a contemporary of

Šāstra material, so also the Kālikāpurāņa and the Saurapurana.
Kālikāpurāņa (88) contains material pertaining to acāra. “Some of
the extant purāņas, if not all, are much earlier than the 6th century
A.D."

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Hemädri and hence we have two references to the Kälikāpuräna,
one in the Caturvargacintāmaņi and the other in the Acärädaría,
both the works being treatises on Dharmaśāstra, composed by two
different authors who were contemporaries.
A third writer on Dharmaśāstra viz. Anantadeva ( 1675-1700 ),'
refers to some verses in the Kālikāpurāņaand the V yavahāramayu-
kha of Nilakantha (1610-1645 A.D.) contains some remarks on them.
Kamalākarabhatta“ ( 1612 A. D.) regards these verses as genuine.'
These references collected by Prof. Kane show clearly how the
Kālikāpurāna came to be looked upon as an authority on certain
points of Dharmaśāstra in centuries subsequent to the date of
its compostion, though primarily it was looked upon as a tantra
work by the Sāktas.
Alberuni ( 11th century ) gives us a list of the 18 purānas
which of course does not contain the Kālikāpurāņa. A writer
of Alberuni's historical sense and regard for accuracy of detail
would not have failed to note the Kālikāpurāņa had it been very
popular in his time in India. This view is also consistent with
the view expressed by Farquhar? that the Sākta philosophy
attained recognition about the 10th century. Mr.Farquhar, however,

DATE OF THE KALIKAPURAŅA

makes the following remarks about the date of the Kalikapurana':-
"The Kālikāpurāņa or Tantra, which has long been well known,
is clearly a manual of the Sāktism of Bengal? and probably comes
from a date near the beginning of the period.” The period to which the
Kālikāpurāņa has been assigned by Mr. Farquhar is the period of
"Muslim Influence, A. D. 1350-1800” and the beginning of this
period means the 14th century (2nd half ). Consequently the date
of the Kālikāpurāpa would, according to Mr. Farquhar, be roughly
the 14th century. Our evidence as recorded above proves, however,
that the work was composed before A. D. 1200, if not earlier.
Since the foregoing evidence regarding the limits for the date
of the Kālikāpurāņa was recorded by me, my friend Dr. V. Raghavan
of Madras has favoured me with an earlier reference to this
purāņa occurring in the Bharatabhāsya of King Nānyadeva. The
Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute possesses a rare MS
of this work, viz. No. 111 of 1869-70. The reference to the
Kālikāpurāņa appears as under on folio 132a of this MS......

King Nânyadeva, the author of the Bharatabhäsya, has been
identified by Mr. M. R. Kavi ' with King Nānyadeva of Mithilā
who flourished between A. D. 1097 and 1133. Prof. R. C.

first to establish on a satisfactory basis that the accession of the
king falls in 1097 A. D.” Prof. Mujumdar also states that the
question of Nānyadeva's date may be regarded as finally settled.
In view of Nānyadeva's reference to the Kālikāpurāņa
towards the close of the 19th century we can safely fix 1000
A. D. as the limit before which this purāņa must have been
composed and await earlier references to this work from scholars
interested in the chronology of the purāņas.

Aufrecht does not record any Mss of the work on music called
the Samgitacūdamaņi in his Catalogus Catalogorum. There are,
however, to be found references to and quotations from this work
in literature on music as also in allied literature as will be shown
below.
In a work called the Bharataśāstragrantha, a Ms of which is
available at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, ( No. 40 of 1916-18 ) the
following quotations have been ascribed to the Samgitacūdāmaņi :-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
A reference to the Samgitacūdāmaņi from a 15th century
work is furnished by Dr. Raghavan,' of the University of
Madras, who states that a work called Cūdāmaņi is quoted and
criticized in the Tälapadikā of Gopendra Tippa Bhūpāla, who was
Governor under Devarāya II ( 1423-1446 A. D.) of the Vijayanagar
Dynasty and that most likely it is King Pratāpa's Samgitacūļāmaņi.
If this assumption is correct we can take this as a 15th century
reference to the work.
Dr. Raghavan also gives us a still earlier reference2 viz. that
made by Pārsvadeva in his Sangītasamayasāra.' This reference is
not made to the title of the work but to its author “Pratāpabhū-
bhuj” or King Pratāpa in the following verse :-
" पञ्चतालेश्वरो यद्वा हृद्यं गद्यमथापिवा ।
af Final: ganggfiyat II"
That King Pratāpa or “Pratāpaprthivībhūbhuj” mentioned by
Pārsvadeva in the above verse was the author of the work Saṁgita-
cüdāmaņi is proved by the first verse in the extract from the Bharata-
Šāstragrantha (folio 3 ) given above. The 2nd line of this extract,
explicitly stated by the author of the Bharataśāstragrantha to be
from the Samgītacūdāmaņi, contains the name of King Pratāpa
in the following line which reads--
"HargaFs: #fea: gang: TIUFT."
The reading "fang: gerai F1#” makes no meaning and is
obviously wrong, being a substitute made by the copyist for the
original reading, which must have been “fariyeruar.” Pārsva-
deva's verse quoted above, in which the expression “garrigatuar'
occurs, appears to have been modelled on the verse from the
Samgitacūdāmaņi as quoted in the Bharataśāstragrantha. The
expression “Taratatul” is identical in both the verses and
Dr. Raghavan appears to be right in his inference that Pār-
śvadeva is referring in his verse to King Pratāpa, the author of
1. Later Samgita Literature ( published in the Journal of the
Madras Music Academy), p. 11 of the offprint kindly supplied to me
by the author.
2. Some Names in Early Sangita Literature ( paper read before
the Madras Music Conference, December 1931 ) p. 31 of the off-print
supplied to me by the author.

the Samgitacūdāmani. A8 Dr. Raghavan assigns Pārsvadeva to a
period between A. D. 1165 and A. D. 1330 we may take this refere-
nce to be, say a 13th century reference to the Samgitacūļāmaņi.
A still earlier reference to the Samgītacūļāmaņi is furnished
by Prof. Handiqui' from the commentary on the Naişadha by
Vidyadhara which is assigned by him to about 1250 A. D. This
commentator quotes two works on music viz. (1) Samgita-
cüdāmaņi and (2) Samgitasāgara in his gloss on canto XXI,
verses 126-128. This reference in a work of about 1250 A. D. proves
that the work Samgitacūļāmaņi must have been composed before
A. D. 1200. The popularity of the work is shown not only by the
above references but also by the fact that it is referred to in a work
on music published in 1842 A. D.2 I am not aware if any Mss of
the Samgitacūdāmaņi have been traced. Recently I inquired about
this work of the Travancore Durbar but the Private Secretary to
the Maharaja of Travancore informed me that the Palace Library
contains a Ms of the Saṁgitacintämaņi only and not of the Saṁgīta-
cūdāmani.

2. The Samgitarāgakalpadruma by Krishnananda Vyāsadeva
( published in 1842 and re-edited by the Bangiyasahityaparişad in 1916)
refers to a work called Cūdāmani which I presume to be Samgita-
cūdāmani. My reference is found on folio 28 of Ms No. 980 of
1887-91 in the Govt. M88 Library at the B. O. R. Institute and not to
the printed edition.

Bhojarāja on. Dharmaśāstra i
Prof. P. V. Kane' makes the following remarks about the
composition of works on Dharmaśāstra by Dhāreśvara Bhoja-
deva :--
" That he (Bhojadeva ) composed an extensive work on the
principal subjects of Dharmaśāstra follows from numerous refer-
ences to him contained in the Mitākṣarā, the Dāyabhāga, the
Hāralatā and other works,.................. Whether Bhoja composed
on Dharmaśāstra one work or two (as he composed two on
poetics ) and whether his work was a commentary or an inde-
pendent digest it is difficult to say.”
Aufrecht? ascribes two works on Dharmaśāstra to Bhoja viz.
(1) Cārucarya and (2) Vyavahāra-Samuccaya. Regarding the
V yavahāra-Samuccaya he makes the following entry3: -
"Quoted by Raghunandana, Oxf. 292a, by Kamalākara,
Oxf. 279b."
Prof. Kane mentions a work called l’yavahāra-Samuccaya in
the following entry in his lista of works on Dharmaśāstra :-

In his list of authors on Dharmaśāstra we have the following

In none of the references recorded above we find any mention
of a work called व्यवहारमंजरी ascribed to भोजराज and referred to by a
commentator of the Mahābhārata viz. Vimalabodha,' whose
commentary variously known as Durghațārthaprakāśini or Vişama
Ślokī or Durbodhapadabhañjini has been preserved in the Govt. Mss
Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona. This Ms is No. 84 of
1869-70. As this commentary is yet unpublished I reproduce the
reference to व्यवहारमंजरी from this Ms from Folio 63 b:-
" एवं नानारूपे व्यवहारपुरुष इति अयं च सार्धश्लोको भोजराजेन व्यवहार-
मंजर्यामन्यथा व्याख्यानः । उभयोः सत्यानृतप्रवृत्तयोर्वादिप्रतिवादिनीविरुद्धो व्यवहारः ।

बहनि उभयोनयनानि यस्मिन् स तथा । चतुरक्षरत्वात् । व्यवहारस्य ।"
The above reference to HIFTIJ as the author of a work on
Dharmasastra called व्यवाटारमंजरी in a Ms. of Vimalabodha's com-
mentary appears to be very important as no l'ss of this work have
been recorded so far in the Mss catalogues. The other work
of Bhojarāja on 771 mentioned by Aufrecht and Prof. Kane viz.
1. Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute ( Sukthankar : Epic
Studies ) Vol. XVII, p. 194, -- Irjunamiśra mentions Vimalahodha,
who cites Devabodha, hence we get the Series देवबाप-विमलकोप-अजुनमिथ.
Vimalabodha mentions Vaišampāyana's ţikā and cites Devahodha
(once as Svāmin ).
2. The colophon of the B. (). R. I. Ms reads as under :--
" इति श्रीविषमश्लाकी टीका समाप्ता ॥ “ इदं पुस्तकं शुद्धां दुर्गिलां प्रति ज्ञात्वा अत्यंता-

This copy was written at Poona in A. D. 1802 by a scribe Krsnam-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
the 590617A22 is known only by references to it in other works
on Dharmaśāstra and hence it is difficult to decide whether these
two works by Bhojaraja on व्यवहार viz. (1) व्यवहारमंजरी mentioned
by Vimalabodha and (2) 699ETTAHEZU mentioned by Raghunandana
are identical or otherwise. For the present we have no other course
left open but to treat them as two separate works of Bhojarāja and
await further research on the question from the students of the
history of Dharmaśāstra literature.

33. Rare Manuscripts of Subhūticandra's
Commentary on the Amarakośa 1
In an article contributed by me to the Kuppuswami Shastri
Commemoration Volume I have tried to prove that Subhūticandra
wrote his commentary on the Amarakośa between A. D. 1062 and
A. D. 1172. My conclusion was based on the analysis of a fragment
of this commentary (Govt. Ori. Mss Library No. R. 2933 ( 1-35-44 ) )
as given by Dr. T. R. Chintamani in the Journal of Oriental Research,
Madras' and the reference to Subhūti in the grammatical work
Durghațavịtti of Saraṇadeva composed in A. D. 1172. I have not
been able to identify the quotation from Subhūti occurring in the
Durghațavrtti as no Ms of Subhūti's work has yet been available
to me. Even the Madras fragment analysed by Dr. Chintamani
was stated by him to be the only Ms newly brought to
light. I was, therefore, curious to know if more Manuscripts of this
valuable commentary were brought to light by the efforts of research
scholars in recent years.
Thanks to the labours of Tripitakācārya Rāhula Sāṁkrtyāyana
we have been fortunate enough to know that three more Mss of
Subhūticandra's commentary on the Amarakośa have been brought
to light. In his recent list of “Sanskrit Palm-leaf Mss in Tibet"
he refers to three manuscripts of this work viz.--
(1) Copy in the Lalchand Library of the D. A. V. College,
Lahore.
(2) Two copies available in Tibet, these are:-

Unfortunately these manuscripts of the commentary available
in Tibetan monasteries are incomplete. Rāhula Sāmkệtyāyana does
not furnish any details about the D. A. V. College Ms of the
commentary referred to by him.
It will thus be seen that there are now 4 Mss of the commen-
tary brought to light though they are hardly sufficient for a critical
edition of the whole work.
The Ms in the Nagor Monastery is very important as it cor-
roborates my conclusion about the date of Subhūticandra ( between
A. D. 1062 and 1172). This copy on palm-leaf is dated 313 Nepali
Era = A. D. 1191 and this date of the copy harmonizes with Sarana-
deva's reference to Subhūti in lis Durghațavytti in A. D. 1172. We
may, therefore, safely conclude that Subhūti wrote his commentary
on the Amarakośa about the first half of the 12th century say
between A. D. 1100 and 1140. The date A. D. 1121 for a palm-leaf
Ms of this commentary need not be looked upon with suspicion as
the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute possesses dated
palm-leaf Mss some of which have even earlier dates.

and authors the literaryotary was dra's dat
We are thankful to Dr. T. R. Chintamani of the University of
Madras for having acquainted us with the rich historical contents
of the fragment of a manuscript of Subhūticandra's commentary on
the Amarakośa,' which has been acquired by the Govt. Oriental
Mss Library, Madras and is numbered R - 2933 (1-35-44). The
varied references numbering about 129 made by Subhūticandra to
several ancient works and authors in his commentary as recorded
by Dr. Chintamani amply reveal the literary strata of the period of
Sanskrit literature when the present commentary was written, as
also those of a period much earlier than Subhūticandra's date.
Many of the works referred to by Subhūticandra are still unknown
or known only by their titles.
As Dr. Chintamani has not said anything about the date of this
commentary in his article under reference, I propose in this note
to fix its chronological limits on the basis of the data available at
present.
Aufrecht? has the following remarks in his Catalogue of
Manuscripts about Subhūticandra :-
“सुभूतिचन्द्र - or abridged सुभूति, a commentator on अमरकोश quot-
ed in माधवीयधातुवृत्ति, by उज्ज्वलदत्त, Rayamukuta in धातुरत्नाकर,

We know that Bhānuji's father Bhattoji Dikşita flourished about
1630 A. D. and Rāyamukuta wrote in 1431 A. D. Ujjvaladattta is
assigned to circa 1250.“

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Dr. Chintamani in his article refers only to Rāyamukuța and
Bhānuji Dikşita and to the translation of Subhūticandra's com-
mentary preserved in Tibetan. According to him A. D. 1431
would be one of the limits to Subhūticandra's date, while, as we
have noted above, Aufrecht's list of references pushes this limit
back to about A. D. 1250, the date of Ujjvaladatta.
Looking to the numerous references made by Subhūti in his
commentary we find that he refers to Bhojarāja ( No. 18 of Chinta-
mani's list ) as also to his two works, viz., Sarasvatikanthābharana
(No. 102) and Srngāraprakāśa ( No. 104 ). Bhojarāja flourished
between A. D. 1010 and A. D. 1055' and died after A. D. 1062.2
It would thus appear that Subhūti wrote his commentary between
A. D. 1062 and 1250.
The above limits, viz., A. D. 1062 and 1250 can still be
narrowed down on the strength of a further reference pointed out
by the learned editor of the Kalpadrukośa' in the following
remarks :-
" Another old commentator ( on the Amarakośa ) often quoted
by Bengal commentators is Subhūti or Subhūticandra, a Buddhist,
whose commentary called Kamadhenu exists in a Tibetan version
( Ind. Wört. p. 21). Subhūti is mentioned in Durghațavrtti of
Saranadeva ( 1173 )."
The Durghaļavrtti of Saranadeva, who is a Buddhist himself, records
its own date of composition, viz., A. D. 1172 and the only reference
to Subhūti“ in the same appears as under :-
"संज्ञापूर्वविधेरनित्यत्वाद् वृद्धयभाव इति सुभूतिः''
The above reference makes it clear that Subhūti wrote between
A. D. 1062 and 1172.

SUBHOTICANDRA'S COMMENTARY ON AMARAKOŚA
219
Further data which might enable us to narrow down even
these limits may also be discussed. In his article under reference
Dr. Chintamani remarks about ' Vopālita' referred to by Subhūti
in his commentary : “ Vopālita is older than 1100 A. D.” Though
this conclusion by itself does not enable us to say that Subhūti
wrote after 1100 A. D. it may suggest in combination with Su-
bhūti's references to Bhojarāja and his works that the commentary
may have been composed after 1100 A. D. Then again the lexicon
Visvaprakāśa of Maheśvara composed in A. D. 1111, which is
quoted by another commentator of Amara viz. Sarvānanda in his
commentary composed in A. D. 1159, is not found in the list of 129
references made by Subhūti to earlier authors and works as noted
by Dr. Chintamani. This omission, if justified in the light of a
further analysis of the whole of Subhūti's commentary ( Madras
MS being only a fragment ) may indicate that Subhūti wrote before
A. D. 1111 ( date of Viſvaprakāśa )or that he being a contemporary
of the author of Viśvaprakāśa did not regard the latter's work as
worth quoting in case he had access to it. At any rate the omission
of such a popular work as the Viśvaprakāśa Kośa which held its
sway over all commentators beginning with Sarvānanda (A. D.
1159 ), has its own significance pertinent to Subhūti's date.
The commentator, Sarvānanda mentions in verse 3 of his
beginning of the Amarakośați kā that he used 10 previous commen-
taries on Amara. Sarvānanda, himself a Buddhist, may have
known the commentary of Subhūticandra though he nowhere men-
tions either his name or the name of the commentary. If Subhūti.
candra could be mentioned by Saranadeva in A D. 1172 it is possi-
ble that his commentary must have been used by Sarvānanda in
A. D. 1159. Out of the 129 references of Subhūti about half the
number is found in Sarvānanda's commentary on the Amarakośa
The references common to both the commentaries are the

many more references from Sarvānanda's commentary could be
found in the commentary of Subhūti because Dr. Chintamani's list
of references is based only on a partial survey of the commentary,
the Madras MS containing commentary extending from almost the
beginning to the end of the 1st Varga in the 2nd Kānda only as
reported by Dr. Chintamani, The foregoing references though
common to Sarvānanda and Subhūti are not, however, sufficient to
establish the exact obligations of the former to the latter in the
composition of his commentary. Another commentator on the
Amarakośa who is definitely indebted both to Sirvānanda and
Subhūti is Lingābhatta. Mr. Sheshagiri Sastri' refers to him as
“the latest of the commentators” on the lexicon of Amara. He
has made full use of Sarvānanda's Amaraţikā and refers to him as
the 'Fatetera77FrT.' Mr. Sheshagiri Sastri gives a big schedule of
references to earlier works and authors found in Lingābhatta's
commentary. From this list I find that Subhūtichandra has been
mentioned by Lingābhatta not less than 43 times. This number of
citations shows clearly the influence of Subhūticandra on sub-
sequent commentators of Amara and it would really be a great gain
if the whole of his commentary is recovered. Even the fragment
that is now recovered should be published and made available for
a closer study by Sanskritists.
From Dr. Chintamani's list of references we come to know
that Subhūti refers in his commentary to Dhananjaya ( No. 29 ) and
possibly to his Nāmamālā ( No. 71). There has been raging a
controversy about his date. According to Dr. K. B. Patlaka
Dhanañjaya flourished about A. D. 1123. This date has apparently
been accepted and echoed by Winternitz and Keith in their
Histories of Literature. If it is correct we shall have to fix A. D.
1123 and A. D. 1172 as the limits for Subhūticandra's date. This
date has, however, been challenged by Vīra Rāghavāchārya, Dr. A.
Venkatasubbiah and other scholars, who are more in favour of an
early date for Dhananjaya in view of Bhoja's reference to his poem

Dvisandhāna which would put the date of the poem between A. D.
960 and 1000. We cannot, therefore, rely upon this date in the
present stage of the controversy raging round it. From the list of
references common to Subhūti and Saryānanda given above we
know that Sarvānanda refers to Dhanañjaya as also to his Nāma-
mālā in A. D. 1159, a fact which is useless for our purpose be-
cause we find Vardhamāna quoting from Rāghavapāņdavīya of
Dhanañjaya in A. D. 1140. Prof. Macdonell opines' that
Dhananjaya's Rāghavapāndavīya quoted by Vardhamāna is an
imitation of Kavirāja's work. According to Mr. Vīra Rāghavā-
chārya, Kaviraja was a contemporary of Muñja, Bhoja's uncle
(A.D. 975–95 ) and that the Telugu poet Pālkuriki Somana ( 1190 --
1260 A. D.) refers to Kavirāja in his Paņditārādhyacarita. These
facts so far as they go are in favour of an early date for Dhanañjaya
as given by Mr. Vira Rāghavāchārya, viz., A. D. 960—1000, which
contradicts Dr. Pathak's date for Dhanañjaya viz., A. D. 1123.
For the present we may regard A. D. 1062 and 1172 as the limits
for Subhūticandra's date as pointed out above or in general we may
say that he flourished in the first quarter of the 12th century.?

35. Date of Ānandabodha Yati, the author of
Nyāyamakaranda and other works on Vedānta
- Between A. D. 1200 and 1297 or the middle
of the 13th Century 1
Dr. Das Gupta remarks in his History of Indian Philosophy'
about Anandabodha :-
“ Anandabodha is a great name in the school of Sankara
Vedānta. He lived probably in the 11th or 12th century......... He
wrote at least three works on Sankara Vedānta viz. Nyāyamaka-
randa, Nyāyadipāvali, and Pramāņamālā.” Aufrecht? records the
following works as the works of Anandabodha Paramahamsa :-
(1) Nyāyadipävali and its comm. Pramāṇaratnamālā.
(2) Nyāyamakaranda.
(3) Nyāyāpadeśamakaranda.
In the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series 'the following works of
Anandabodha have been published :-
(1) Nyāyamakaranda ; (2) Pramāņamālā ; and (3) Nyāya.
dipāvali.
If the Pramāṇaratnamālā mentioned by Aufrecht is identical
with the Pramāramālā published in the Chowkhamba Series it does
not seem to be a commentary on the Nyāyadipavali, as stated
by Aufrecht.
Mr. M. R. Kavi,“ however, informs us that Anandabodha, wrote
another work called "Nyāyadipikā.” He observes :-“ Anandabodha,

a pupil of Ātmavāsa wrote a commentary on the Säbdanirnayadipikā
of Prakāśātman. The commentary is known by the name of Nyāya-
dipikā. Citsukha, a contemporary of Anandagiri commented on the
works of Anandabodha."
Mr. Kavi informs me that the above information about Ananda-
bodha's authorship of Nyāyadipikā is based on the following verse
which appears at the end of a Ms of the work described on p. 4812
of Triennial Catalogue of Mss, Vol. IV Part I (B) of the Govt. Ori.
Mss Library, Madras :-
" नमो निखिलवेदान्तकमलाकरभानधे ।
. आत्मवासाभिधानाय गुरवे गुणवेश्मने ।
दुस्तकध्वान्तपटलप्रपाटनपटीयसी।
इयमानन्दबोधेन रचिता न्यायदीपिका ॥"
In the beginning of the Ms the line “Tr a Hi Er zifəz.
PRET fàufrya' clearly states that the work is a commentary on
TE PATUFE and not“ on paigazinazor” as stated by Mr. Kavi in
the extract quoted above.
I have now to record the following reference to a “ Nyāya.
dipikā" made by Anandabodha himself in his Nyayamakaranda.
This reference appears as under in the Chowkhamba Edition of the
Nyāyamakaranda referred to above :-
P. 170 -- “ EFATIA7 la fazaret Forefrom=989: "
Evidently the “ Nyāyadipikā” in the above reference is identi-
cal with the Nyāyadi pikā referred to by Mr. Kavi as the commen-
tary of that name on the Sābdanirnaya of Prakāśātman. It would
appear that Anandabodha is referring in the above line to an earlier
work written by him.
Nyāyadipikā is thus the title of a commentary on the
Sābdanirnaya of Prakāśātman. This latter work appears to be
identical with that published by T. Ganapati Sastri' and ascribed
to Prakāśātman.
Mr. Kavi further observes that Anandagiri ( also called Ananda-

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
jñāna and Janārdana ) was a contemporary of Citsukha and that he is
generally assigned to A. D. 1200. Anandabodha, whose “ Nyāya.
makaranda” was commented on by Citsukha, lived at least half a
century prior to Anandagiri. The chronological order of the three
authors would, therefore, be as follows :-
(1) Prakāśātman, author of the Sābdanirnaya.
(2) Anandabodha, author of Nyāyadi pikā, a commentary on
the Sabdanirnaya of Prakāśātman.
A. D. 1200 -
Contemporaries
ſ (3) Citsukha ( commented on Anandabodha's
Nyāyamakaranda)
į (4) Anandagiri ( commented on Anandabo.
dha's Nyāyadīpāvali )
According to Mr. Kavi, therefore, Anandabodha's date would
be about 1150 A. D.
As against this date viz., A. D. 1150 for Anindabodha Dr. Das
Gupta' assigns Prakāśātman, who stands first in the above list of four
writers, to A. D. 1200 and remarks that he wrote a work called
Sābdanirņaya in which he tried to prove the claims of scriptural
testimony as valid cognition. I have not examined the grounds on
which this date of Prakāśātman viz. A. D. 1200 is based but as Dr.
Das Gupta mentions it several times in his book, I presume that it
is based on reliable evidence. I had requested Dr. Das Gupta to let
me know his grounds for the date of Prakāśātman. Though he is
unable to do so at present owing to illness he has promised to
consider my request as soon as he feels well.
It is proposed now to fix the limits for the date of Ananda-
bodha and for this purpose the date A. D. 1200 assigned to
Prakāśātman is useful as it gives us one terminus to the date of
Anandabodha who commented on the work of Prakāśātman in his
Nyāyadipika as mentioned above by Mr. Kavi. The other termi-
nus is furnished by the commentary of Caņļūpandita on the
Naişadha-Carita of Sri Harsa. This commentary was composed in

Samvat 1353 ( A. D. 1297 )' and it quotes from the Nyāyama-
karanda of Anandabodha in commenting on v. 108 of Canto XXI of
the Naişadhacarita.?
It will be seen from the foregoing data that Anandabodha lived
after Prakāśātman (A. D. 1200 ) and before Candūpandita ( A. D.
1297). We are, therefore, inclined to assign him to about A. D.
1250 or the middle of the 13th century and not 11th or 12th century
as Dr. Das Gupta has done in his llistory of Indian Philosophy.

36. Anandabodha's Authorship of Nyāya-
dīpikā and Limits for his Date I
In his illuminating article on the date of Istasiddhi of Vimu-
ktātman, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao' makes the following cautious
statement about the authorship of the Nyāyadipikā, a commentary
on the Sābdanirnaya of Prakāśātman :---
“If this Anandabodha is the same person as the one of that
name who was the author of Pramāṇaratnamālā, a treatise on the
Advaita system and the Sābdanirnayavyākhyā (or Dipikā or Nyāya.
dipika ), etc.” The above remarks appear to contain a doubt about
Anandabodha's authorship of Nyāyamakaranda and Nyāyadīpikā.
I have pointed out in my note on the date of Anandabodha?
that the author of the Nyāyamakaranda and Nyāyadipikā appears
to be identical for the following reasons :-
(1) Anandabodha in his Nyāyamakaranda refers to the Nyāya-
dīpikā, which was presumably composed by him earlier as the fol-
lowing lines will show :--
"दिङ्मानमत्र सूचितं विस्तरस्तु न्यायदीपिकायामवगन्तव्यः"
(2) The manner in which the above reference is made by
Anandabodha shows that to save much labour in exposition he is
pointing his finger to a detailed exposition of the topic under dis-
cussion in the Nyāyamakaranda.
(3) In the Madras MS of Nyāyadipikā, the following state-
ment proves that the author of the treatise was Anandabodha :--
"दुस्तकध्वांतपटलप्रपाटनपटीयसी इयमानंदबोधेन रचिता न्यायदीपिका"
Prima facie, therefore, the above facts appear to clear up the
I Journal of the Mythic Society, Vol. XXVI, pp. 153-156.

2. Calcutta Oriental Journal, Vol. II (1935).

doubt of Mr. Hayavadana Rao about Anandabodha's authorship of
of both the ( 1 ) Nyāyamakaranda and (2) Nyāyadipikā, though I
have not verified the reference to Nyāyadipikā found in his Nyāya-
makaranda in the text of the Madras MS of the Nyāyadipika.
Another point which I want to bring to the notice of Mr.
Hayavadana Rao is the reference by Candūpandita in his commen-
tary on the Naişadha composed in A. D. 1297. He quotes a long
passage from the Nyāyamakaranda' of Anandabodha as follows :-
" असति प्रत्यक्षविपयस्वे भेदस्य अनुमानस्यापि च्याप्यव्यापकभेदज्ञानाधीनस्य
भेदावभासे प्रामाण्यं निरस्तम् . . . . . . इत्थं निरस्तनिखिलप्रतिकूलतर्कात् वेदान्त-
वाक्यनिकरानिखिलोऽपि भेदः। शक्यो निपेडमिति सिद्धमनाद्यविधा, तद्वासना-
विरचितभ्रममावसिद्धिः" इति श्रीमदानन्दबोधाचार्यरपि न्यायमकरंदे भेदं
fargall"
A. D. 1297 is, therefore, one sure terminus to Anandabodha's
date and it is in harmony with the inscriptional evidence brought
forth by Mr. Hayavadana Rao for the date of Citsukha, who com-
mented Anandabodha's Nyāyamaharanda. According to this
inscriptional evidence, Citsukha's literary activity may fall between
A. D. 1220 and 1284, the dates of the two inscriptions in which
Citsukha is styled as Citsukha Somayājin and Citsukha Bhattāraka
alias Narasimhamuni. If the Citsukha mentioned in the inscrip-
tions is identical with the commentator of Anandabodha's Nyāya-
makaranda, it would appear that Candūpandita, the author of the
Naişadhațīkā and Citsukhācārya were almost contemporaries,
Candū being possibly a younger contemporary.
Mr. Hayavadana Rao rightly looks upon the date of Prakāśāt-
man as the other terminus to the date of Anandabodha. If this date
of Prakāśācman is finally fixed, we shall be in a position to clinch
the issue with some certainty. At present, two dates for Prakāśāt-
man are put forward. They are :-
(1) A.D. 1200 - According to Dr. Das Gupta,' this date is given
1. Naişadha Carita, edited by Handiqui, 1934 (Punjab Ori.
Series ), p. 480.
2. History of Indian Philosophy, Vol. II, p. 17, foot-note 2 and
at other places in the volume.

· STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
to Prakāśātnian several times in the History of Indian Philosophy
but in all these references the grounds for this date are not men-
tioned. I had requested Dr. Das Gupta to let me know his grounds
for this date but have not yet heard from him in reply.
Dr. T. R. Chintamani of the Madras University writes to me
in a private communication dated 22nd March 1935, as follows :
“The date of Prakāśātman adopted by you from Dr. Das
Gupta is not correct for it is very well and widely known that
Rāmānuja who lived between A. D. 1015 and 1137 has criticized in
his Bhāşya the syllogism of Prakāśātman. In view of this fact, it
is impossible to bring down Prakāśātman to any period later than
A. D. 1000. The date 1200 for Prakāśātman is definitely wrong.
The date of Citsukha is fairly correct (A. D. 1200 ) and Ananda-
hodha who preceded him cannot be later than at least A. D. 1150.
He was propahly slightly older.”
I have not examined the grounds of Dr. Chintamani's criti-
cism of the date A. I). 1200 for Prakāśātman as given by Dr. Das
Gupta but have quoted his view to enable Mr. Hayavadana Rao to
survey his facts in the light of this criticism.
(2) A. D. 1000. -- Prof. M. Hiriyanna' as quoted by Mr.
Hayavadana Rao assigns Prakāśātman to A. D. 1000. This view
appears to come nearer to Dr. Chintamani's view stated above
that Prakāśātman is not later than A. D. 1000.
The chronological order of the several writers mentioned
above may now be represented as under:-
(1) Prakāśātman — 1200 A. D. ( Dr. Das Gupta).
— 1000 A. D. ( Prof. Hiriyanna ).
- not later than A. D. 1000.
( Dr. Chintamani j.
(2) Rāmānuja -- Between A. D. 1015 and 1137.
(3) Anandabodha --- Before A. D. 1297 ( Candūpandita ).
(4) Citsukha --- Between A. D. 1220 and 1284 ( Inscriptions ).

In the present state of the above chronology, for want of a more
definite date for Prakāśātman I am inclined to agree in general
with Mr. Hayavadana Rao in his remarks about Anandabodha's date,
viz. “Anandabodha should be assigned to a date somewhat later
than A. D. 1000 say circa A. D. 1050” but may go a step further
and conclude that he may have flourished between 1050 and
A. D. 1100.

37. Who was the Guru of Anandabodha ? -
Vimuktātman or Ātmayāsa ? I
Prof. M. Hiriyanna, the learned editor of the Baroda edition
of the I șțasiddhi' makes a very cautious inference on the strength
of a half stanza which is found in the I stasiddhi of Vimuktâtman as
also in the Pramāņamālā of Anandabodha. Anandabodha intro-
duces this stanza with the words “ gaitriJara:.” Our attention is
also directed by Prof. Hiriyanna to another stanza in the Nyayama-
karanda of Anandabodha which contains the words "paratai
catata" analogous to the words “gaçats TELIT:.”
I propose in the present note to show that Vimuktātman was
not the guru of Anandabodha and that the references made by
Anandabodha in the words “ TTI: ” or “ parTi:" to an earlier
writer show only his respect for the author, whose opinions he
is citing in his works with esteem and regard in view of the
fact pointed out by Prof. Hiriyanna himself that Anandabodha
held views in regard to many a detail of Advaitic doctrine
which are identical with those maintained by Vimuktātman. These
references may still be taken to allude to Vimuktātman, the author
of the Işțasiddhi on account of the kinship of views between the
two authors as pointed out by Prof. M. Hiriyanna.
But before I state my evidence which runs counter to Prof.
Hiriyanna's cautious suggestion based on a half-stanza common to
the works of Vimuktātman and Anandabodha and which he owes to
Mahāmahopādhyāya Prof. Kuppuswamy Shāstri as he gratefully
informs us in a footnote, I must quote the pertinent extract from
Prof. Hiriyanna's Introduction to the I șțasiddhi to acquaint the
reader fully with his argument on the point at issue and the possibi-
lities, hinted though very cautiously about the chronological
position of the two authors viz. Vimuktātman and Anandabodha.
Prof. Hiriyanna observes (p. xiii) —“ There is a book with the
title of Pramāņamālā by Anandabodha, a well-known exponent of
I Calcutta Oriental Journal, Vol. II, pp. 229-232.

WHO WAS THB GURU OF ANANDABODHA ?

the Advaita and in it he quotes the following half-stanza which he
found in Işğasiddhi (i, 36) prefacing it with the words kagaie TEF:
- 'नान्यत्र कारणात्कार्य न घेत्तत्र क तद्भवेत् ।
We may deduce from this, though we cannot be at all sure
about it, that, Anandabodha was a disciple of Vimuktātman. There
is nothing improbable in this for Anandabodha was an early writer
on the Advaita and, has shown by his references to the Isfasiddhi in
another of his works N yāyamakaranda, he held views in regard to
many a detail of Advaitic doctrine which are identical with those
maintained by Vimuktātman. But as Anandabodha's date is not
definitely known, this conclusion even if correct throws no light
on the chronological position of the present work.'
The above passage raises two questions :---
(1) Was Vimuktātman, the author of the Isfasiddhi, the guru
of Anandabodha ?
(2) What is the chronological position of the Istasiddhi'
with reference to Anandabodha's Nyāyamakaranda, which contains
references to the I stasiddhi of Vimuktātman?
Our answer to the first question must be in the negative on the
strength of Anandabodha's own testimony contained in the follow-
ing verse appearing at the end of a Manuscript of a work called
Nyāyadīpikā by Anandabodha :-
"नमः सकलसंसारसागरोत्सारसेतवे
संश्रिताखिलसंकल्पकल्पवृक्षाय शम्भवे ।
नमो निखिलवेदान्तकमलाकरभानवे
आत्मवासाभिधानाय गुरवे गुणवेश्मने ॥"
The expression " भात्मवासाभिधानाय गुरवे" stating in unmista-
kable terms that rate was the Ta of Anandabodha directly con-
tradicts Prof. · Hiriyanna's cautious deduction that Anandabodha
was the disciple of Vimuktātman, the author of the Işțasiddhi and

" gawainTFTT: "introducing a half.stanza, which is common to the
I stasiddhi of Vimuktātman and the Pramāṇamālā of Anandabodha.
We must understand by the word “ Tart: " only a respectful refe-
rence to a predecessor's opinion instead of direct relation of the
guru with his disciple.
H
The work Nyāyadipikā referred to above is a commentary by
Anandabodha on the Săbdanirnaya of Prakāśātman ( Tregoigace-
ar Strahitor fartuà). Ānandabodha's authorship of this work
is vouched by him in the following verse which appears at the end
of the Madras Ms of Nyāyadipikā referred to above :-
"दुस्तकंध्वान्तपटलप्रपाटनपटीयसी ।
इयमानन्दबोधेन रचिता न्यायदीपिका ॥"
Prof. Hiriyanna remarks further :-." It is strange that the colo-
phons in none of the three works of Anandabodha included in the
volume (Chowkhamba Series) mention his guru.”
I have made it clear in the foregoing paragraph that the colo-
phon of the fourth work of Anandabodha viz. N yāyadipikā con-
tains a direct reference by Anandabodha to his guru. So far as the
chronological order of the Njāyadīpikā and Nyāyamakaranda is
concerned I can say that the Nyāyadipikā was composed earlier
than Nyayamakaranda because Anandabodha refers to the former
in the latter as under :-
“ दिङ्मात्रमत्र सूचितम् विस्तरस्तु न्यायदीपिकायामवगन्तव्यः"
I cannot say anything about the chronological order of the
other works of Anandabodha with reference to N yāyadipikā but if
it is proved that they are later than the Nyāyadipikā like Nyāya-
makaranda, we may easily explain why no reference is included
in them by Anandabodha to his guru. Having once made such a
detailed reference in the earlier work, viz. Nyāyadīpikā perhaps he
thought it superfluous to do so in every single work written by him
subsequently. The second question stated above viz. What is the
chronological position of the Işğasıddhi with reference to the
Nyāyamakaranda ?, will require a detailed examination of the refe.
rences to ștasiddhi in the Nyāyamakaranda and other works of
Anandabodha and hence cannot be dealt with in this note.
As regards Anandabodha's date, which as Prof. Hiriyanna states
is not definitely known, I am inclined to assign him between

WHO WAS THE GURU OF ANANDABODHA ?
233
Prakāśātman ( on whose Šābdaniiņaya he wrote the Nyāyadipikā )
and Candūpandita ( A. D. 1297 ), the author of a commentary on the
Naişadha, who directly quotes in his commentary from Ananda-
bodha's Nyayamakaranda.'
The date of Prakāśātman as given by Dr. Das Gupta is A. D.
1200.2 Presuming this date to be correct I had placed Ananda-
bodha between A. D. 1200 and 1297. My friend Dr. T. R. Chinta-
mani of the Madras University writes to me, however, in a private
letter dated 22-3-35 :-" The date of Prakāśātman adopted by you
from Dr. Das Gupta is not correct for it is very well and widely
known that Rāmānuja who lived between 1015 and 1137 has criti-
cized in his bhāşya the syllogism of Prakāśātman. In view of this
fact, it is impossible to bring down Prakāśātman to any period
later than 1000 A. D. The date 1200 for Prakāśātman is definitely
wrong. The date of Citsukha is fairly correct (1200 A. D.) and
Anandabodha who preceded him cannot be later than at least
1150 A. D. He was probably slightly older.”
Between these two dates for Prakāśātman viz, A. D. 1200 of
Dr. Das Gupta and about A. D. 1000 according to Dr. Chintamani
I am unable to make a choice at present as I have not examined
their grounds. The date of Anandabodha as given by me on the
strength of Dr. Das Gupta's date for Prakāśātman is about A. D.
1250, while Dr. Chintamani regards Inandabodha to be “not
later than at least 1150.” If this date of Anandabodha is definitely
decided it will throw more light on the chronological position of
the Istasiddhi of Vimuktātman to which references are made in the
Nyāyamakaranda as pointed out by Prof. Hiriyanna. In the pre-
sent state of our inquiry the two dates for Anandabodha referred
to above viz, A. D. 1250 and A. D. 1150 do not affect Prof. Hiriy-
anna's view that Ișțasiddhi may have been composed between
A. D. 850 and 1050. Dr. Das Gupta,“ however, assigns Vimuk-
tātman to the early years of the 13th century" i.e. A. D. 1200, a
conclusion which conflicts with Dr. Chintamani's date for Ananda-
bodha viz., about 1150 A. D. but is in harmony with my date for
Anandabodha viz. about 1250 A. D. presuming the priority of
Vimuktātman to Anandabodha to be correct.

The oldest Dated manuscript of the

Dr. S. K. De' in his chapter on “Mammața and Allata"
has recorded the MSS of the Kāvyaprakāśa available in diffe-
rent MSS libraries in India and Europe. Further in fixing
the lower limit of Mammata's date he has made use of the date
1160 A. D. (Samvat 1216 ) when Mānikyacandra composed his com-
mentary on the Kävyaprakāśa. As Dr. De's History of Sanskrit
Poetics was published in 1923 and as the Catalogue of the MSS in
the Jain Bhandars at Yesalmere was also published in the same
year, he could not make use of the following important dated MS
of the Kävyaprakāśa which provides a definite lower limit to Mam-
mata's date earlier by about 2 years. Mr. C. D. Dalal gives the fol-
lowing description of this MS :-

ruling. This Anahilapātaka is identical with Anahilapattana called
also Anihilwār in northern Baroda in Gujarat founded ini, A. D. 746
after the destruction of Valabhi by Banarāja or Vamsarāja. Hema-
candra flourished at the court of Kumārapāla, king of Anahila-
pattaña ( A. D. 1142-1173 ) and was his spiritual guide. According
to Dr. Bhau Daji ( Brief Notes on Hemacandra )' Kumārapāla became
a convert to Jainism in A. D. 1172, in which year Hemacandra died
at the age of 84 but according to other authorities, the conversion
took place in A. D. 1159 ( Twaney's Intro. Prabandhacintāmaņi
p.ji). After the overthrow of Valabhi in the 8th century Anahila-
pattana ( also called Anahilapura) became the chief city of Gujarat
or Western India till the 15th century.?
The colophon of the Kavyaprakāśa MS dated 1158 A. D.
quoted above states that this work viz., the Kāvyaprakāśa is the
work of Rājānaka Mammața and Alaka (“a prar AIZTOFT:" ).
Many papers have been written on the question of the joint
authorship of the Kāvyaprakāśa. The traditional verse about
this joint authorship is quoted by Rājānaka Ānanda in this com-
mentary called the Kāvyaprakāśa-nidaršanā. It informs us that
Mammața composed the work as far as parikara and the rest
was completed by Alaka. As Rājānaka Ānanda is a late
commentator,' his statements need independent and early corro-
boration on the question of the dual-authorship of the Kāvyaprakāśa.
Such early corroboration is found in the 1st quarter of the 13th
century, when Arjunavarman in his commentary on the Amaruśataka
1. Ascording to Prabandhacintāmaņi Kumārapāla reigned for
31 years (V. S. 1199 to 1230). The Therāvali gives the reign period :
1199 to 1229 V.S. Published records of the time of Kurnārapāla
are dated A. D. 1145, 1149, 1150, 1151, 1153, 1154, 1156, 1159, 1161,

quotes from the Kāvyaprakāśa ( VII A. D. 14).' Ruyyaka ( 2nd and
3rd quarters of the 12th century) alludes to the dual authorship of
the Kavyaprakāśa but does not mention the name of Allața as the
continuator. In view of the absence of Alaka's name in Ruyyaka's
allusion of the 12th century and in view of the other references
being removed from Mammața'date by about a century,
Pandita Lakşmidhara's colophon of the Kavyaprakāśa MS of
1158 A.D. is a better and more explicit corroboration of the
Kashmirian traditions about the double authorship of the
Kavyaprakāśa than that furnished by Rājānaka Ananda in the 17th
century or Arjunavarman in the 13th century.

“ TEIE ETofauti FATTI” and “ ...... F1694613727Ut........

2. Ibid., p. 164 – Dr. De rightly observes that the combination
of names in the colophon of a MS of the Kāvyaprakāśa (" YTTETH-
17I-AFFI: 5777-fatera etc.”) should not lead us to think that the
Kāvyaprakāśa is a joint compilation of Allața, Mammața and Rucaka.
Dr. De (p. 163 ) states that of the three forms of the name, 377, 3188
and 3172, the last appears to be the most authentic. The colophon of
the Jesalmere MS of 1158 A. D. uses the form 3177.
3. Vide History of Sanskrit Poetics, I, by Dr. S. K. De, p. 160 —
“Mammața probably belongs to the period between the middle of the
11th and the first quarter of the 12th century. Allowing two genera-
tions to intervene between him and Ruyyaka, we may assign
Mammața's literary activity roughly to the last quarter of the 11th
century.'
4. Dr. De: Sanskrit Poetics, I, 162 – This tradition is sup-
ported by the colophons of some MSS of the Kavyaprakāśa. Dr. De
states that a Bodlien MS (Hultzsch collection 172 ) mentions
Mammața and Alaka as authors of the K. P. as follows :-
“ufa: TIFFAFH17273771: ” .
This MS is a Kashmirian MS in Sārađã characters, and its statement
about the dual authorship exactly tallies with tilat of the Pațțaņa copy
of the Kavyaprakāśa ( A. D. 1158 ) deposited in Jesalmere Bhandar.
Evidently the 1158 A.D. copy must have been prepared from a Kashmiri
original in Kumārapāla's time when the contact between Gujarat and
Kashmir was frequent and continuous. According to the Prabhā-

OLDEST MANUSCRIPT OF KAVYAPRAKASA
237
In the list of published records given by Dr. H.C. Ray in his
Dynastic History of Northern India, Vol. II (pp. 977 ff.) I could
not find any record for the years 1157 and 1158 A.D. Our present
colophon, therefore, is useful in this respect also as it is dated 1158
A.D. and hence provides us some record for that year at least.
The importance of this colophon is further enhanced by the
identity of a portion of it with the opening sentence of another in-
scription dated V. S. 1213 ( = A.D. 1156) the beginning of which
reads as follows:----
sul si ll 97 9793 97 He are o ll faoinize tatar-

Dr. Bühler' has quoted this inscription while discussing the question
of the date of Kumārapāla's conversion to Jainism. This inscription
deals with the presentation of land by the Vabāmandalika Pratāpa-
simha and it is preserved in the Temple of Pārsvanātha in Naddūla-
Nādol.
(Continued from previous page )
vakacaritra (C. 1250 A. D.) which is the oldest source for the life of
Hemacandra, Hemacandra compiled his grammar after looking
through the MSS from Kashmir, fetched by the officials of Jayasimha,
the predecessor of Kumārapāla. These MSS included eight older
grammars which were to be found in their entirety only in the
library of the Temple of Sarasvati in Kashmir (l'ide p. 15 of Bühler's
Life of Hemacandra — Eng. Trans. by Manilal Patel — Singhi Jain
Series ed. by Muni Jina Vijaya, 1936).
1. Vide p. 35 of Life of Hemacandra ( Patel's Trans.). “Kumāra-
pāla received the title 97891797 i.e., “the most eager hearer ( of the
Jaina-doctrine ) as stated in the colophon of an old MS which was
written......in V. S. 1221 ( = A. D. 1165 ) while his conversion is not
mentioned in a Jain inscription of V. S. 1213.” (p. 90) — " As the
inscription contains a presentation to the Jainas one might surely
expect a mention of Kumārapāla's conversion in case the same had
already taken place. The exact date of this is, according to Dr.
Schram's:calculation, January 20th 1156, a Friday."

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
This inscription has been edited by Dr. D. R. Bhandarkar.'
It will thus be seen that while the Kävyaprakāśa copy of A. D. 1158
was made by Pandita Laksmīdhara, the Nādol grant of A. D. 1156
was written by Pandita Mahīpāla. The sentence common to both
these records is the following:
" श्रीमदणहिलपाटके समस्तराजावलीसमलंकृतपरमभंडारकमहाराजाधिराजपरमे.
श्वर --- उमापतिवरलब्धप्रसादप्रौढप्रतापनिजभुजविक्रमरणाङ्गणविनिर्जितशाकम्भरीभूपाल-
श्रीकुमारपालदेवकल्याणविजयराज्ये"
The colophon of the Kāvyaprakāśa MS states : "ofoedeTTOT
ghala fossefa”. If the word "fretta ” is taken in its strict
sense the statement would mean that Pandita Lakşmidhara got this
copy prepared for him. If, however, fearai be interpreted to
mean facerdi, Lakşmidhara himself becomes the scribe. Can we
suppose that Pandita Mahīpāla's sentence quoted above is reproduc-
ed by Pandita Lakşmīdhara in the Kavyaprakāśa colophon? If
Paņdita Lakşmidhara is supposed to be a different person from the
copyist of the Kāvyaprakāśa MS, it may be possible to suggest that
Kāyastha Mahipāla may have copied the MS of the Kāvyaprakāśa
for Pandita Lakşmīdhara and in doing so he only repeated a sentence
from his inscription of A.D. 1156 two years later. This suggestion,
however, needs more evidence because an alternative inference
may be made to the effect that Pandit Lakşmidhara had before him
in 1158 A.D. the earlier Nádol grant of A.D. 1156.
1. Indian Anti. 1912, Vol. XLI, pp. 202-203 - Dr. H. C. Ray has
summarised the contents of this Nádol grant ( vide p. 981 of his
Dynastic His. II). "The grant consists of one rūpaka per day from
the custom house (mandapika ) of Badari to some Jaina temples......
The inscription was written by the T151727-1779-91057-&TAT."

38. Guņa patākā, an unknown Sanskrit work
and its Date Before -- A. D. 1200 -
No work of the name Gunapatākā has been recorded by
Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum. In the list of Plays
recorded by Prof. D. R. Mankad in his Types of Sanskrit Drama' he
records a work called “Guņamālā” inentioned by Abhinavagupta
in his commentary on the Nāțyaśāstra but its connection with
TOTG77rt remains doubtful at present. I propose, therefore, to
record in this paper some references to a work called Torqatar and
indicate as far as possible the chronology of these references which
may prove the existence of this work for a period of at least 500
years, if not more.

TUTAISI in his Gleanings from Abhinavabharati [ K. B. Pathak Comm.

As a result of my inquiry with some of my friends I have succeed-
ed in locating some more references to गुणपताका. They are as
follows :-
Sesa Krsna in his work called the प्राकृतचन्द्रका mentions गुणपताका
and quotes a Prakrit verse' from it as follows :---
Ms.? No. 243 of 1895-99 ( B.O.R. Institute, Poona ) Folio 46 ---

2. There is another MS. of the Prākrta-Candrika at the
B. O. R. Institute (No. 255 of 1884-86). This MS is a late copy
made at Bombay by Ganesh Parashuram Godbole in Saka 1807 (= A.D.
1885). The third MS of the work is found in the India Office
Library (MS. 945, p. 267 of I.O. Cata., II, 1889). Dr. Eggeling
describes this MS as “ fairly written in Devanāgarī, about A. D.
1550." If this description is correct the MS appears to be a contem.
porary copy and hence extremely valuable for a critical edition of
this text.

GUŅAPATĀKĀ, AN UNKNOWN SANSKRIT-WORK
241
Unlike the Sanskrit quotation from Guņapatākā recorded above
from Närāyana Diksita's commentary on the Vāsavadattā we have
in the above extract a Prakrit verse from गुणपताका.
It remains to be seen if the work TOTT71957 was a “ lyrical play”
of the type of TTATGT referred to by Abhinavagupta ( A. D. 990-
1020 ). If the quotation from the Treat-for from Sesa Krsna's
Prākṣta-candrikā is genuine, it may enable us to infer that Seșa Krsna
who fiourished towards the end of the 16th century2 had before him
a Ms of the TOTTarat or that he had taken this quotation from some
other Sanskrit or Prakrit work as an illustration borrowed second-
hand. Even if we suppose that the quotation does not forın part of
the Prákrta--candrikā, it must retain its value as we know of no other
quotation from TOTTAT For in Prākrit recorded in a Ms. References to
the TotalFi by Nārāyaṇa Dikșita and by Seșa Krsna being somewhat
of a later dite do not give us any idea about the antiquity of this
work. It is, therefore, necessary to see if there is any evidence to
suggest or warrant an inference that this work, whatever be its
exact nature or contents, is earlier than A.D. 1200. Such evidence
is fortunately forthcoming from a commentator on the Malatī.
1. P. V. Kane: Sāhityadarpana, 1923 ; Index of authors, p. clx.
2. Aufrecht: CC, I, 117. Sesa Krsna flourished during the
reign of Emperor Akbar.
3. While commenting on “79a712FHUTTarar" (Mālati-
madhava, Act VII, p. 192 of Bhandarkar's edition) Harihara says
(p. 82 ):---
__ “नवववृविनम्भणोपायस्तु । बाला ताम्बलमाला फलरससुरसाहारसंमानहार्येत्यादि
लौकिकः कन्यावर्जनोपायः"
Jagaddhara ( p. 292 of Bhandarkar's edn. ) who has at times borrowed
verbatim says ;-
___ " नववधूविस्त्रम्भणोपायस्ताम्बलादिदानम् । यदाह । बाला ताम्बूलमालाफलरससुरसा.
हारसंमानहार्येत्यादिक: सुप्रसिद्ध एव ।"
Ir will be seen from Harihara's quotation given above that he is
quoting the stanza "arest aira HIT etc." which Nārāyaṇa Diksita
quotes as from a work called ITTF1. How the name Tutfit came
to be applied to the work under reference may perhaps be explained
by the following referenee to ITTFT made by Harihara in comment-
ing on the Mālatīmādhava verse 3737TT ATT ( Act V of Bhand. edn.
p. 232). Harihara says :---
“त्वया च मालत्यामसमञ्जसं प्रक्रममाणेन संसार एवासारः कर्तु प्रक्रान्तः। संसारे किं

ed his commentary during the reign of Arimalladeva, the founder
of the Malla dynasty of Nepal. In fact Harihara records the date of
composition of his commentary which corresponds to A.D. 1216.'
Harihara appears to have flourished between A.D. 1150 and 1225.
The suggestion made by me in the foregoing lines to the effect
that Guņapatākā was a definite work of that title gets further
strengthened by the mention of the work by Pșthvīdhara, the com-
mentator of the Mịcchakațika,? who quotes from it in his commen-
tary on Act IV while explaining the term “ forargrität: ” :-

The approximate chronology of the references to Gunapatākā
recorded so far is as follows:
A.D. 1216 --- Harihara in his commentary on the Mälatīmādhava
quotes a verse which is quoted by Nārāyaṇa Dikşita as
from a work called Guņapatākā. Harihara also refers to
a female character of the name Gunapatākā at one place
in his commentary.

1. Vide Descriptive Cata, of Kavya MSS., Vol. VII (1934),
pp. 242-243. The date of composition as recorded in MS No. 5299
is Newari Samvat 336 = A. D. 1216, which I take to be the date of
composition. Even if this is the date of the copy the date of Hari-
hara lies between A. D. 1150 and 1225 as he quotes from Mammața's
Kāvyaprakāśa ( about A. D. 1100 ).

his date in a separate paper.

It will be seen from the above table that a work of the name
Gunapatākā known to Sanskrit writers from say A. D. 1200 to 1600
i.e. a period of 400 years has apparently been lost and conse-
quently not even its name is recorded by Aufrecht in his Catalogus
Catalogorum or by other compilers of Catalogues. I shall feel
thankful if any close students of Sanskrit literature throw more
light on this work viz, the Guņapatākā by recording any references
to it found by them during the course of their studies.

39. Identification of the Siddharāja-Saras
In a work called the Sarasvatīpurāņa,' devoted mainly to the
description of holy places or tirthas associated with the river Saras-
vati? in Gujarat falling into the gulf of Kutch, there is a good deal
of description of a like called 17TIFAT:.3 This lake, the Saras-
vatipurāņa tells us, was formed from the river Sarasvati itself :
Folio 110a ( of Ms No. 429 of Viś. I )--
" एवं सरस्वती ब्रह्मन् प्राचीभूत्वा मरिद्वरा ।

| Indian Historical Quarterly, Vol. XIV, pp. 252-258.
1. MSS of the Sarasvatīpurāņa mentioned by Aufrecht are :--
Part I, p. 699-"Kh. 64. B. 2, 34; BL. 2; Gu. 3; Bhk. 14; Poona
429" ( a Sāradāpurāņa is frequently quoted by Hemādri). Out of these
MSS the MS available to me is “Poona 429 ” which is the same as
No, 429 of Viś I in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. (). R. Insti-
tute, Poona.
2. N. L. Dey's Geographical Dictionary ( London, 1927) pp. 180-
181, where various identifications of the river Sarasvati are recorded.
We are concerned here with the river Sarasvati which is an
affluent of the river Kuvarkā falling into the gulf of Kutch.
3. llenacandra, a contemporary of Siddharāja refers to this
lake as follows in verse 114 of canto XV of the Dvyāśrayakāvya.
" अतीता मेंथिलं युद्धं राघवो नु कृतऋतुः।
प्रापातेतरतिभ्यां स पूर्त चक्र गहासरः॥ ११४॥"
Abhayatilakagani who wrote his commentary on the Dvyāśrayakāvya
in Sam. 1312 = A. D. 1236 comments on the above verse as follows :-
" स राजा सहस्त्रलिङ्गाल्यं महासरः पूर्त चक्रे का रयत्"
(Vide analysis of this Kāvya in I A., IV, p. 269 ) cf. also verse
117 of canto XV of the Dvyāśrayakāvya :-

This lake, thereafter, became the abode of all heavenly beings
as Siddharāja established one thousand lingas of god Siva all
round it :-
" तथा नागा सुपर्णाश्च सिद्धाश्चक्रधराश्च ये।

The place in course of time attained great celebrity as a
centre of religious purification :-
" एकस्मिन् शिवकुण्डेऽपि....मुक्तिदं नृणाम् ।
किं पुनर्यरसहस्रस्य लिङ्गानां पुरतः स्थितम् ।। ३८ ॥
त्रिषु लोकेषु विख्यातं सिद्धराजसरोवरः ॥ ४० ॥"
It became pre-eminent ainong the holy places owing to the
presence of 1000 Siva lirigas :-
“सर्वेषामेव तीर्थानामिदमेवाधिकं सरः ।
सहस्रं यत्र लिङ्गानां स्थितं देवगणैः सह ।। ४६ ॥"
Even god Keśava made this place his abode to please king
Siddharāja :--
"प्रीत्यर्थ सिद्धराजस्य पुण्येत्वमृतसागरे ।

In front of god Kesava is situated the दशावतारक तीर्थ in the
Siddharāja lake :-
" तस्य देवस्य पुरतः तस्मिन् सरसि संस्थितम् ।
दशावतारकं नाम......पप्रणाशनम् ॥ ५८ ॥"
The ten images of the ten incarnations of god were established
at the दशावतार तीर्थ by Siddharāja himself. These ten images are
of the ten avatāras viz :-
(१) मत्स्य, (२) कूर्म, (३) वराह, (४) नरसिंह, (५) वामन,
(६) भार्गवो रामः (७ ) दाशरथिराम, (८) कृष्ण, (९) बुद्ध and (१०) कल्कि
( verses 61 and 62 ).
Another tirtha called the दशाश्वमेधिक तीर्थ is situated in front of
the image of वामनावतार :-
"वामनस्याग्रतस्तत्र कुरुक्षेत्रं सदास्थितम् ।
. . . . . .त्याः सहाया तं कथितं ते महानघ ॥ ७६ ॥
दशाश्वमेधिकं तीर्थ तस्यैक पुरतः स्थितम् ।
......नामश्वमेधानां यत्र ख्यातः फलं लभेत् ॥ ८॥"
Sumati now asks Mārkandeya to explain to him the genesis of
the 1000 Siva lingas, which is then explained in a mythical style as
follows:
" बाणेन यानि लिङ्गानि विमुक्तानि नदीजले।
तेषां सहस्रसमुद्धत्य सिद्धराजः समानयत् ।। ८३ ॥
स्थापितं सिद्धराजेन तस्मिन् पुण्यसरोवरे।

(Continued from previous page)
temple of Rudreśvara destroyed, of course, by the Muslims, who raised
a large octagonal Rauzah on its ruins; but of this only the dilapidated
remains now exist." It appears from verses 48, 49, 50 of the Saras-
vatipurāna quoted above that the central temple was of Keśava or
Vişņu and not of Rudreśvara and this fact is consistent with the
दशावतारक तीर्थ in front of the god Kesava in the same lake containing
the inages of the 10 incarnations of god Vişņu as described in detail
by the Sarasvatipurāņa ( verses 61-62 of chap. xvi).

The purificatory powers of a single Siva linga have been men-
tioned by god Siva himself in the fara TIET. What can be the
power of 1000 Siva liigas ? :-
" एतत्तु शिवशास्त्रेषु शिवेन कथितं स्वयम् ।
सहस्रं दृश्यते यत्र किं वय॑ते मया ॥ ८६ ॥"
Siddharāja practised penance on a mountain called the
अमरकंटक and then took his bath in the waters of the river Narmada
(v. 90). God Omkāra was pleased at this and granted Siddharāja
a boon, promising that he would thenceforward reside permanently
on the embankment of the Sahasralinga Lake :-
" त्वया सहस्रलिङ्गानां स्थापितं तत्सरस्तटे ।
तत्र वत्स्यामहं नित्यं भक्त्या ते प्रीतिमानसः ॥ ९२॥"
Then follows a long Porsgla dealing with the effects of religious
rites performed at the Sahasralinga tirtha, followed by the prasasti
of king Siddharāja and his Lake as follows:--
"न सिद्धेशसमो राजा न सरस्तादृशं क्वचित् ।
समं सहस्रलिङ्गेन तीर्थमन्यत् (न) दृश्यते ॥ २२० ॥
तत्रागाराणि तेनैव स्थापितानि सरस्तटे ।

I shall now record the description' of the Sahasraliriga Talāv,
the construction of which has been ascribed to king Jayasimha
Siddharāja2 of Gujarat ( A. D. 1093-1143 ). Various artificial lakes
or reservoirs in Gujarat are ascribed to Siddharāja. “One of the
largest of these was the Sahasralinga talāv, or tank of the thousand
Saiva shrines at Pattan the remains of which are still pointed out
to the north-west of the town. It must have been a reservoir of
of immense size, and derived its name from the numerous little
temples containing lingas, placed on the steps around it. In the
centre was an island on which stood the temple of Rudreśvara,
destroyed of course by the Muslims, who raised a large octagonal
Rauzah on its ruins; but of this only the dilapidated remains now
exist." “ The basin of the lake is now converted into little-fields.
The great embankment surrounding it appears to be composed
throughout of solid brick-work and this was once faced with solid
masonry forming flights of steps to the water's edge. On and
above these steps stood the thousand shrines of which fragmentary
remains are still found buried in the debris of the embankment."
“This tank is said to have been begun by Jayasimha Siddharāja
1. Burgess and Cousens : 'Architectural Antiquities of Northern
Gujarat' ( Arch. Survey of West in India, Vol. IX }, London, 1903,
pp. 38-39.
2. Vide pp. 973-977 of Dynastic Hisiory of Northern India hy
Dr. Hem Chandra Ray, Vol. II (1936 ) - Jayasimha was a great
builder. Besides the Sahasralinga Talāv the temple of Rudramahākāla
at Siddhapur is also ascribed to him. ( The Sarasvatīpurāņa contains
a description of this temple and some genealogy of Siddharāja but I
shall deal with this material in a separate paper ). Jayasimha appears
to have been a devotee of the Saiva faith. The era known as the
Simha era was already in use in Jayasimha's reign (Vide Atru Stone
Inscription dated in the year 14 of this cra as also Mangrol inscrip-
tion of Kumārapāla dated in the 32 year of this era ). One sorrow
viz. the want of a son gnawed at his heart. Dr. Ray (p. 975) gives a
table showing the relationship of Kumārapāla with his predecessor
Jayasimha.

shortly before he set out against Y:sovar man, the sovereign of
Mālava and is the theme of legend and song.”
A historical incident associated with this tank is the stabbing of
Bairām Khān, the famous minister of Humayun, when alighting from
a boat after a sail on the tank on Friday, the 31st January 1561.
Bairām Khān rebelled against Akbar and was sent to Mecca. He
came to Patan and was hospitably received by Musā Khan Fûladi
the Governor, but was stabbed by Mubarik as described above.
Burgess further remarks that during the 14th century all
the rich shrines of the Hindus (Brahmanical or Jain ) were
desecrated, plundered and demolished at the will or caprice
of the Moguls. If this statement is applicable to the Sahasra-
linga Talāv we may presume that the shrines on the embankment
of this talāv may have been destroyed in the 14th century. I
am of opinion that the Sarasvatipurāna was composed at a time when
the tirthas associated with the river Sarasvati had attained so sacro-
sanct a character as to necessitate the creation of a special purāņa
like the Sarasvatipurāņa.' It would also be reasonable to suppose
that when this purāņa was composed all the tirthas on the banks of
the river Sarasvati were quite in a flourishing condition, free from
the ravaging hands of the Moguls.
The Bombay Gazetteer records the following information about
the Sahasralinga Talāv :-
"The Sehcsling or Sahasraling Talāv, the tank with the thou-
sand shrines, was dedicated to Shiv by Sidh Raj just before he set
out on his expedition against Yasovarman, king of Málava. A
merchant left nine lakhs of Balotras with a certain banker and died.
The heirs of the latter knew nothing of the sumn and refused to take
it. Jai Sing Sidh Raj decided that the money should be spent in
building a reservoir, and it was done, “the finest in the world,
hitherto unsurpassed by all that the cleverest and wisest have
executed or imagined, and it remains to this day ( A.D. 1200-1230 ).”
1. Henacandra, a contemporary of Siddharāja Jayasinha informis
us ( in chapter xv, verse 118 of the Duyāśraya Mahakārya ) that
Siddharāja Jayasimha caused to be made the Sahasralinga tank and
established also schools for learning Jyotişaśāstras, Nyāya-śāstras,
and the Purānas. Perhaps the Sarasvatīpurāņa may have been the
outcome of the study of Purāṇas instituted by Jayasimha.

I believe the foregoing description of the Sahasraliniga tank if
compared with that given in the Sarasvatīpurāna leaves no doubt
that the Siddharāja-Saras described in the latter work is exactly
identical with that now known to history and archaeology. It
appears, however, that though the tank was called a Sahasralinga-
saras the actual number of Saiva shrines on the bank of this lake
was one thousand and eight as stated by Hemacandra शंभोःसहस्रमष्टौ-
चायतनानि सरस्तटे ।।
The testimony of Hemacandra being contemporary must be
taken as conclusive on the question of the exact number of the
Saiva shrines on the bank of the Siddharāja lake.*

the author of the Sāhityavidyādharī, Com -

Cāritravardhana, the author of Commentaries
on Raghuvamśa, Kumārasambhava etc. I
In one of my Notes on Indian Chronology on the date
of Câritravardhana, I tried to fix the limits of his date.
Incidentally I stated in this note that Căritrayardhana was
also called Vidyadhara or Sāhityavidyadhara, son of Rāma.
candrabhisak. My statement of identity of Căritravardhana
and Vidyādhara was based on the following entry in Aufrecht's
Catalogue :-
" चारित्रवर्द्धन called also विद्याधर or साहित्यविद्याधर, son of Rama-
candrabhisak.
कुमारसंभवटीका, नैषधटीका, रघुवंशटीका, राघवपाण्डवीयटीका, शिशुपाल-
Tuttar"
Though Aufrecht does not record the source of his identity of
Cāritravardhana and Vidyādhara, it appears to have its origin in the
following statement of Dr. Bühler :-
“He ( Candūpandita ) asserts that before his time only one
commentary on the Naişadha existed, composed by Vidyadhara
( alias Sahityavidyādhara alias Cáritravardhana muni).”
It is not clear on what evidence Dr, Bühler bases this identity
of Vidyādhara and Cärit ravardhana. Perhaps it may have been bas-
ed on mere hearsay. However, in his article on the Age of

Naişadhiyal published in 1875 Dr. Bühler does not refer to this
identity, which leaves an impression that he was not aware of its
mistaken character, otherwise he would have taken this opportunity
to correct his original statement made in the Report under
reference. He observes in his article :-
"He ( Candūpandita ) further states that in his time there exist-
ed only one commentary on it ( Naişadhīya-carita ) composed by
Vidyādhara, alias Sāhityavidyādhara of which I have found frag-
ments at Jesalmere and Ahmedabad.”
The pertinent verse? in Candūpandita's commentary in which
he refers to Vidyādhara reads as follows:-
" टीकां यद्यपि सोपपत्तिरचनां विद्याधरो निर्ममे
श्रीहर्षस्य तथापि न स्यजति सा गंभीरतां भारती।
दिक्कूलंकपतां गतैर्जलधरैरुद्गृह्यमाणं मुहुः
पारावारमपाम्बु किमिह स्याजानुदन्नं क्वचित् ॥"
No clue is furnished by this verse in favour of the identity of
Cáritravardhana and Vidyadhara as supposed by Dr. Buhler in his
Report for 1874-75 and it appears that Aufrecht as a cataloguer has
exceeded his powers to a certain extent in presuming this identity
to be correct and modifying his entry accordingly by consolidating
under the heading “Cāritravardhana" works of two different
authors viz. Câritravardhana and Vidyādhara.
When I wrote my note on the date of Cāritravardhana I did
not doubt the truth of Aufrecht's entry. Subsequently Prof.
Handiqui's edition of the Naişadhīya came to my hands, Prof.
Handiqui devotes about 5 pages in the Introduction of this Edition
to Vidyādhara and his commentary on the Naişadhiya Vidyā-
dhara's commentary was based on the text of the Naişadhīya pre-
served in the library of king Viśāladeva of Gujarat, also called
A parārjuna, who reigned till. 1264 A. D. Prof. Handiqui, therefore.
assigns this commentator to the fifties or sixties of the 13th
century.

MISTAKEN IDENTITY OF VIDYADHARA AND CĂRITRAVARDIANA 253
gested by him in his Report for 1874-75 led me to the belief that
if Vidyādhara and Căritravardhana are not two different authors
but are identical, then when the date for one of them viz. Vidyā-
dhara is fixed, the date of the other viz. Căritravardhana is auto-
matically settled. This belief had another harmonising factor in
the fact that the date A. D. 1250 or 1260 for Vidyādhara was well
within the limits for Cāritravardhana's date fixed by me on
other evidence viz. A. D. 1172 and 1385.
My belief, however, did not last long when I began to verify
the source of Buhler's supposed identity of the two commentators
viz. Vidyādhara and Caritravardhana. I began to hunt for Mss of
Cāritravardhana's commentary as such on the Naişadhiya in Aufre-
cht's Catalogue.' He records the following Mss of this com-
mentary:~
(1) B. 2.90 (p. 90 of Fascicule Il of Bühler's Catalogue of
Mss from Gujarat etc.-1872)
(2) X. LXIII ( = No. 142 of 1875-76 of the Govt. Mss
Library at the B. (). R. Institute, see extract on p. Ixiji of Buhler's
Report 1877).
The description of the first of the two Mss revealed that
it is not a Ms of Cāritravardhana's commentary but of Vidya-
dhara's, judging from the description and name of the author viz.
Vidyādhara recorded in the same. The second Ms viz. No. 142
of 1975-76 was exuined by me and it also turned out to be a Mis
of Vidyādhara's commentary and not of Cāritravardhana's. The
next question that arose out of the above disillusionment was :
Whether Cāritravardhana wrote any commentary on the Naisa-
dhīyacarita different and distinct from Vidyādhara's commentary
on the same Kāvya ? 'The Govt. Mss Library at the Institute has
no Mss of this work. Aufrecht also did not record any other Mss
of the work except tļie two mentioned above as wrongly ascribed
to Cāritravardhana.
The answer to the above question is furnished by the state-
ment of Pandit Shivadatta, who in his Sanskrit Introduction to the
edition of the Naisadhīya-Carita? states that Cāritravardhana wrote

a commentary on the Naisadhiya called Tilaka (चारित्रवर्धनेन विरचिता
faltar ) and that Vidyādhara wrote another commentary on the
same work called Sahityavidyādhari ( विद्याधरण विरचिता साहित्यविद्या-
guitar). He further gives a list of the Mss of different commen-
taries on the Naisadhīya utilised by him and the persons from
whom they were borrowed. This list includes a Ms of Tilaka
commentary of Cāritravardhana borrowed from Rājaguru Dādhīca
Candreśvara of Jaipur and a Ms of Sāhityavidyādhari from Rāja-
guru Nārāyaṇabhatta of the same place. Pandit Shivadatta has
utilized both these commentaries in his footnotes to the edition

ments proves that both these commentators viz. Vidyādhara and
Căritravardhana are two different persons and that they wrote two
different commentaries on the same work Naişadhiya. These
commentaries are known by two different names. Cãritravar-

Introduction.) The first two of these Mss viz. I-A and II-B be-
longing to the Bhadkambkar Collection of the University also con-
tain the Commentary written by the author. Mr. Tenkshe states
“This Commentary was of immense use to me in fixing up the
readings of the Text. Naturally as a rule, I have followed the
readings adopted in the Cominentary.'
In view of the importance of the commentary as indicated above
it is necessary that the commentary should be edited critically and
for this purpose efforts should be made to gather Mss of the

therefore, to bring to the notice of Mr. Tenkshe the following Ms
of the commentary which was acquired by the Bhandarkar Oriental
Research Institute in 1938:-
This Ms belongs to the Limaye Collection' of the Institute.
According to the folio numbers the Ms consists of leaves one to
ninety-one serially numbered but these numbers are entered
apparently by a later hand as the commentary for the first thirty-
(Continued from previous page )
not marked. The 2nd Kānda contains all the stanzas in the edition
printed. It makes only first 40 stanzas and the 44th St. followed by
an index of the 1st and 3rd chapters. This Ms is one of the best
Mss used by the editor. It was copied by the scribe R. B. Devas-
thali in Saka 1642 = A. D. 1720.
II. B. — 101 folios. size:-12" x 4." Each page has 9 lines and
each line contains about 44 letters, carefully written. The M8 has
3 Kändas of the T'ext and Commentary and ends with a short sum-
mary of the Acāra-kānda.
The extent of the Text in the edition may be indicated here :-
1. Sadācāra-kānda
2. Vyavahāra-kāņda
3. Prāyaścitta-kāņda

1. This collection consists of about 450 Mss which were
mainly collected by Sakhopant Anant Limaye Phadņis of Aște
( Satara District ) between A. D. 1800 and 1840 ( vide : Annals of the
B. O. R. Institute, Vol. XX, p. 39, footnotes 1 and 2). Sakho Anant
was the patron of Vāñcheśvarayajvan alias Kuțţikavi, the author of the
Bhâțtacintāmaņi. His family hailed originally from the village Some-
śvara in the Ratnagiri District of the Bombay Presidency. The
Limayes are Chitpăvan Brahmins of Kapi gotra and belong to the
Hiranyakeśī-śākhā. Kuțţikavi composed his commentary on the
Hiranyakeśīsūtra ( between A. D. 1816 and 1828 ) by the order of
Sakho Anant Limaye who was in the employ of Sardar Mahādeva-
bhațţa Pațvardhan, the son of the celebrated Paraśurāmbhāu, Patvar.
dhan, the ancestor of the present Raja of Sangli (S. M. C. ). Parasu.
râmbhāu was killed in A. D. 1799 in a battle with the then Mahārāja
of Kolhapur.

The Fourth Kaņda - Commentary begins at the end of folio
70-b and ends on folio 91-b covering twenty-one leaves. The be.
ginning of this commentary for the fourth Kānda is as follows:-

Folio 91 – The commentary ends as follows :--

From the description of the Manuscript recorded above it
is clear that the Manuscript contains the commentary Vivarana
(by the author ) for all the four Kāndas, except the commentary on
the first thirty-two verses of Kānda I. In particular the commentary
on the fourth Kända is complete' in the Baroda Oriental Research
Institute Manuscript while it is absent in the only two Manuscripts
of the commentary at the Bombay University which contain com-
mentary for the first three Kāņdas only. The best Manuscript of
the Text with the commentary used by Mr. Tenkshe viz. I-A is
dated A.D. 1720 while the Baroda Oriental Research Institute
Manuscript containing the fourth Kāņda also is dated Samvat 1812 =
A.D. 1756 i.e., later by about thirty-six years than the Manuscript
1-A of Mr. Tenkshe's edition of the Visvādarśa. We have, there.

Any scholar interested in the editing of the Viſvādarśavivarana
would find his work facilitated if he makes use of the three Manu-
scripts of this commentary now available. He may also profit by
the use of the Jammu Manuscript of the Text of the Viſvādaría,
not utilized by Mr. Tenkshe in his edition.
I now turn to the question of the exact date of the Viśvādarśa
and its commentary and record below the earlier views of
scholars on this question :---
(1) According to Prof. H. D. Velankar' “ Our author alludes
to Vijñāneśvara, author of the Mitākṣarā.” “The earliest author
who quotes our author is Hemādri in Caturvargacintāmani,
Pariſeşakhanda, pt. 2, p. 112” ...“ Viśvādarśa was also used in
the composition of his Kälādarśa by Adityabhatta. Kālādaría
again is quoted in Kālamādhava ( See I. O. No. 1655 ). The
manner in which our author refers to Vijñāneśvara shows that he
was separated from him at least by a hundred years.
Our author, therefore, must have flourished towards the close
of the twelfth or the beginning of the thirteenth century.'
(2) According to Prof. P. V. Kane, our author is " later
than 1100 A. D. and earlier than 1200.”
1. Cat. of B. B. R. A. S. Mss, 1928, p. 229. Kavikānta was “a
follower of the Advaita School of Vedānta and a pious devotee of
Rāma and Viśveśvara of Benares.” He was patronized by a prince
called Dhanyarāja, son of Nāgārjuna. Prof. Velankar thinks that
“Dhanyarāja was very probably a ruling prince of Benares.”

VIŠVADARśA OF KAVIRÁNTA SARASVATI
261
I shall now record my evidence on the question of Kavi-
kānta's date. In my description of the Baroda Oriental Research
Institute Manuscripts of the Visvādarśa with Vivarana I have
reproduced an extract from the Vivaraņa (fol. 64 ) which consists
of two verses from a work F TËTART as mentioned by the author.
Prof. Kane mentions three different works' of the name Fryetar.
I have succeeded in identifying the two verses from the patate
mentioned as such and quoted by Kavikānta. They are identical
with the following verses in sfat's FFETTATT ? :-
“ ATTTHIETArtia faalk: 80 ( v. 1. art ) gari
ATTIHI ATO T 18591 anul: (v.l. a1) |
Aristi i v.1.) faareigt sige raffari
faraoi ar sarà a (g v. l.) 91779: Fatiefa era:
(à: v. 1.)
"
It is, therefore, certain that Kavikānta used Sridhara's Smýtyartha-
sāra and no other work of the same name. Now as regards the
date of Sridhara, Prof. Kane observes as follows :-
“the Smrtyarthasāra must have been composed between 1150
and 1200 A. D.”
(Continued from previous page)
Prof. Kane states that the fa gigat is referred to in his Friaafiset by
aqulie ( Mysore ed. p. 164 ). AUTHz flourished after A. D. 1150 and
before A. D. 1225 ( Kane, ibid, p. 346 ).
1. Ibid, p. 674, -( 1 ) FYETÉRTC by frutar (C. P. Cat. No.

tion 81 of Prof. Kane's History of Dharmaśāstra. )
2. Vide p. 17 of Smrtyarthasāra of Sridharācārya, Ed. by Vaidya

The variants in the brackets pointed out by me are more or less scri-
bal errors in the B. O. R. I. Ms.
3. History of Dharmaśāstra, Vol I, p. 337 — " The date of the
Smrtyarthasāra can be fixed within approximate limits. As it
names the Mitākṣarā, the Kāmadhenu, the Kalpataru and Govinda.
râja it is later than 1150 A. D. The Smſticandrika and Hemådri both
quote it as an authority."

Page 301****************************************************************************************

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
In view of the above date assigned by : Prof. Kane to the
Smrtyarthasāra of Sridhara and in view of the fact that Kavikānta-
sarasvati quotes from and mentions this work in his commentary
of the self-composed Viśvādarśa, I am inclined to hold the view
that he flourished between A. D. 1200 and 1230. This view agrees
with one of the alternatives suggested by Prof. Velankar that our
author belongs to "the beginning of the 13th Century." If an
author quotes a work composed between A. D. 1150 and 1200 and
is quoted by a subsequent author in his work (Caturvargacinta-
mani ) "composed between 1260 and 1270 A. D.' according to
Prof. Kane, the period — 1200 to 1230 A. D. assigned for him by
me would be considered reasonable. This view also harmonizes
with Devaņabhațţa's reference to the Visvādarśa as pointed out by
Prof. Kane. If Devanabhatta flourished between 1150 and 1225
A. D. according to Prof. Kane his reference to the Viścâdarśa
( 1200 to 1230 A. D.) may warrant an inference that the author
of the Visvādarśa was a senior contemporary of the author of the
Smſticandrikā.
The three views regarding the date of the Viſvadarśa and its
Vivarana may now be tabulated as follows :-
Prof. Velankar' sview
Prof. Kane's view
My view
“ Close of the 12th “ Later than 1100 “Between 1200 and
or the beginning of and earlier than 1200.” 1230 A. D.
the 13th century.
P.S.--Since the above paper was sent to the press I noticed the
following entry about a manuscript of the Viśvādarśa with the
Vivarana on p. 141 of the Census of Indic Manuscripts in the United
States of America and Canada by H. I. Poleman, New Haven,
Conn. 1938:-
“2833. Visvādarsa with the Commentary. 95 £. 11. 25. x 5.25.
8-12 lines, UP 1632."
This manuscript is available in the University of Pennsylvania
Library (Philadelphia, U.S. A.). It is difficult to say on the basis
of the above catalogue entry if the commentary covers up all the
four Kāndas of the Text of the Visvādarśa of Kavikānta Sarasvati.
Scholars interested in a critical edition of this commentary may
inquire of the Librarian of the above Library and elicit the required
information.

42. The Dates of Nārāyaṇa Dīkşita and other
Commentators of the Vāsavadattā of Subandhu
Aufrecht' records the following information about a com-
mentary on the Vāsavadattā by Nārāyana or Nārāyaṇa Dikşita :-
"gigata romance by Subandhu. Commentary by
Nārāyaṇa, B. 2. 106. Radh 22."
"Treat by Subandhu, comm. by Nārāyaṇa Dikşita, A.

I propose to analyse the only available Ms ? in the above list
of Aufrecht viz. A. K. 567, which is identical with No. 567 of 1891-
95 in the B. O. R. Institute - Govt. Ms8 Library. The Ms belonged
once to a man of the name **Tete anafat as stated in an endorsement
on a leaf at the beginning of the Ms. The Ms begins as follows:-

by Aufrecht two belonged to private individuals ; only the 3rd Ms
(AK 567 ) is deposited in the Govt. Mss Library (B. O. R. Institute
under No. 567 of 1891-96. No description of this Ms has been
recorded by Prof. A. B. Kathawate in his report which includes this
Ms among Mss acquired for Govt.
2. The fourth Ms-of Nārāyaṇa's commentary is also recorded
by Aufrecht ( CC II, 224 ) as “ Ulwar 967." This Ms is not accessi-
ble to me. Peterson in his Catalogue of Ulwar Mss ( 1892), p. 42, des-
cribes this Ms as follows :-"967, A commentary on the Vasavadattā,
called Sarvankaşā by Nārāyaṇa Dikşita.”

The parentage of our author as disclosed by the foregoing
extracts may be represented as follows:
विश्वरूप (दीक्षित ) hailing from कन्यकुब्ज ( married
सावित्री)
Son
नारायण दीक्षित, the author of नारायणी टीका on सुबन्धु's वासवदत्ता.
Nārāyaṇa states that he used no less than 20 lexicons and
numerous works on rhetorics and poetics in the composition of his
present commentary. It is natural, therefore, that this commentary
is rich in citations from these and other works as will be seen from
the following list 2 of works and authors mentioned by him :-
__ 1. The expression " म्लेछभिया विमोहितधिया" applied by our com-
mentator to himself suggests that he lived at a place and time full of
insecurity to life and property and the consequent disturbed condi.
tion of mind. The fear of Mlecchas or Mohammedans referred to in
the above expression did not, however, deter our author from complet-
ing the learned commentary before us, with the help of no less than 20
lexicons ( कोशदशद्वयी) and numerous works on poetics ( रसमयान् ग्रंथान्
etc. ) as he informs us in the beginning of his commentary. It was
such zest for study that was responsible for the unbroken continuity
of learned pursuits, glimpses of which we met occasionally in the
casual references of mediaeval writers.
2. I have included in this list some specimens of vernacular
equivalents for Sanskrit words explained by Nārāyaṇa Dikşita. These
equivalents are generally introduced by the expressions : " इति लोके ",
" इति प्रसिद्धिः ", " इति ख्यातः" etc.

CLXXVI ). I am unable to say if शृंगाराणेव is equal to शृंगाररत्नाकर.
2. No lexicon of the name "जयंत " or " जयंतिकोष" has been
recorded by Aufrecht.

1. Visvanātha ( 14th Century A. D.) in his Sahityadarpana

" अथ वृत्तयः -

रसे रौद्रे च बीभत्से, वृत्तिः सर्वत्र भारती ॥ १२॥"
I wonder if SATTHE mentioned by Nārāyaṇa Dikṣita is identical with
कुमारस्वामिन् , the author of रत्नापण commentary on the Prataparudraya-
Sobhusana (about A. D. 1300-1325 ). Kumārasvamin was the son of
Kolacala-Mallinatha. The new date for Mallinātha is A. D. 1430
(see New Indian Antiquary, Vol. II, p. 442 - Dr. Raghavan's article)
and hence his son Kumārasvāmin should be assigned to A. D. 1450.
2. No work of the title "गुणपताका" has been recorded by
Aufrecht in his Catalogus Catalogorum or by Profs. S. K. De and
P. V. Kane in their Histories of Poetics. The work appears to have
been older than A. D: 1200 as I propose to show on evidence in a
special paper later. Prof. Kane informs me under date 23rd February
1940:- "I do not remember to have heard the name of a book called
गुणपताका." Dr. S. K. Belvalkar also informs me to the same effect.

while collecting and putting on record all quotations from it wherever
found. The list of Sanskrit lexical works given by Prof. Rāmāvatāra
Sarma at the end of his Introduction to the Kalpadrukosa I, 1928
( Baroda), pp. LV-LXII mentions no work of the name " उत्तरतंत्र."

FHTqator, 81.
“glarga 39 gfa aferet:,” 82.
" Horses toiture sfa aferi:" 82.
In the above list of references the mention of Fe' and his
Bertarafa of about 1150 A. D. enables us to fix A. D. 1200 as the
earlier limit to Nārāyaṇa's commentary. The references to
HARST on folios 6 and 64 of our Ms further enable us to push this
limit forward up to A.D. 1250 or so, as we know that Hemacandra
was born in A. D. 1089 and died at the ripe old age of 84 years in
A. D. 1173,3
The later limit for Nārāyana's date cannot be definitely fixed
at present but judging by the condition and script of the Ms before
me I am inclined to believe that the Ms was written about A. D.
1600 or 1650. Secondly our commentator, who boasts that he has
used no less than 20 lexicons in the preparation of his commentary,
does not refer to late lexicons. If the reference to FAITHE is proved
to be made by our author to ArtFaraî the son of Mallinātha (A. D.
1430 ) we may be in a position to assert that Nārāyana is later than
A.D. 1500 or so, but as no other work of FATTETITAT is so far known
except the commentary on the Pratāparudrayaśobhūşana and as the
verse ascribed to THITHE is not found by me in this commentary no
conclusion of a definite nature can be arrived at on the strength of
this reference to FAITHE. Perhaps a study of other commentaries

COMMENTATORS OF THE VÅSAVADATTA
271
Nārāyaṇa Dikşita's commentary is one of the 17 commentaries
on the Vasavadattā. I have had occasion to peruse cursorily only
a few of them. Some indication of their chronological limits may
be given below :-
(1) Nārāyaṇa Diksita — after about 1250 A. D.
(2) Vidagdhavallabhā — after about 1350 A. D.
(3) Siddhicandragaņi' Contemporary of Emperor Akbar
(A. D. 1542-1605 ).
(Continued from previous page )
mentioned by alle are found in the above list. The refer-
ences to eat or has found in this commentary are absent in
Nārāyaṇa's commentary. The poet gya and his fatifa mentioned
by this commentary furnish us the earlier limits to its date which
should be about 1300 A. D. as fata is assigned by scholars to the
13th century ( Dr. De : Poetics, I, 219).
1. Vide IHQ, IX ( 1933 ), p. 138 – Siddhicandra, the disciple of
Bhānucandra was a teacher of Akbar. The title Khusfaham was con.
ferred on Siddhicandra by Jahangir. Siddhicandra refers to Akbar
in the following verse of the Vasavadattāvivarana ( Ms No. 781 of
1886-92 ):-
Folio 1 - "37ATIE HETH
योऽपि पठत्पाठकसार्वभौमः।
सहस्रनामानि सहस्ररश्मेः
सौवर्णसिंहासनसंस्थित: सन् ॥ ७॥"
Siddhicandra also refers to Jahangir in verse 10 at the beginning of
this commentary as "GETTTTTT-
5a.” In the colophon Bhānu-
candra is called the teacher of Akbar in reading PHETATA (“ 377.
PRECETTAT:7747"). For further details of Akbar's interest in Sun.
worship see Dr.' Hiranand Sastri's article in the IHQ referred to
above. Siddhicandra refers to the following authors and works in his
aracanau :- HTSCOTATE9, f16747727, fèut, farcit, 31AT, TTT, TTATGT,
HtHiF%, 3TUTT, oiga, avat, Trifase ( fol. 15 ), atror, HATOST,
327727, alat, atrePHTET, 381, F1ATTE, Grafa, 472,679, affatta, Fria (43).
Prof. H. D. Velankar notes two other Mss of Siddhicandra's com-
mentary on the Vasavadattā besides the one I have used above. These
Mas are indicated by him as--"JG.p. 332” and “ VA 15 (38)."

Ori. Mss. Library, Madras ( Cata. XXI, 1918 - Nos. 12421 and 12422 ).
2. Aufrecht CC 1, 652 - Sivarama quotes Of
H a t in the
Lakşmivilāsa , " which suffices to place him in the beginning of the
18th Century.” Vide also S. K. De : Sans. Poetics, I, p. 318 ; and
JAOS, XXIV, 57-63. The Bib. Indica Edn. of the Väsavadattā
( 1859 ) includes Sivarāma's commentary. The editor Fitzedward
Hall used three Mss of this comm. for this edition ( vide p. 44 of
this Preface ). Hall fixes the earlier limits for Sivarāma's date as
A. D. 1373, the date of the lexicographer Mahipa but observes that
Sivarāma must be more modern.”
3. Vide CC III, 120 _“AK 566 = No. 566 of 1891-95 ( B. 0. R.
Institute). This Ms is called 9179aifaqUIT. It ends :-
" यत्संदिग्धमतिश्लिटं क्लिष्टं चामूलभाषितं । तद्वोधार्थमसौयत्नस्तेन
प्रीणातु मे हरिः ॥ इति रंगनाथोद्धतोवासवदत्ताटिप्पनससारः ॥ ६९ ॥"
Ranganātha refers to the following works and authors :-धरणि, विश्व
H78, TrafTore ( fol. 11 ), Jitiat. Possibly TITOJIET mentioned
by Ranganātha is the art by Prabhākara on Väsavadattā (CC I,
566 ). Kielhorn records a Ms of qf#dated Samvat 1741 = A. D.
1685. C. P. Mss. Cata. 1874, p. 76 ).
4. Vide p. 48 of Cata. of Sans. Mss (Private Libraries in the
Bombay Presidency, 1893 ), Ms No. 100 described here by R. G. Bhan-
darkar is Prabhākara's Comm. on a thagarantial. This Ms is dated
Samvat 1903 = A. D. 1847. In the colophon the author is called
“ ATHTHAT THEYHTET."
5. Vide CC II, 134 – “Stein 81” – No.301. Sarvacandra in
his aranchiferaat ( I. O. Cata. VII, 1904, p. 1557 ) mentions" aa-
7 TOT” ( fol. 610). I presume that this is a reference to the com-
mentary of Sarvarakṣita.

(9) Sarvacandra – After
Sarvarakṣita.
A.D.
1300
and
later
than
In the I. O. Ms No. 996 of Sarvacandra's commentary on the
Väsavadattā there is a reference to Vopadeva (fol. 52º) who is, I
think, identical with the grammarian Vopadeva, the protégé of
minister Hemādri ( A. D. 1260). We may, therefore, fix A. D.
1300 or so as the earlier limit to Sarvacandra's date.'
(10) Rāmadeva? — Before A. D. 1470.
A grammarian of the name pieafhet is quoted in Madhavīya
Dhåtuvștti (c. A. D. 1350) according to Aufrecht (CC I, 515).
Aufrecht also states that this grammarian is “ Later than Haradatta.”
If this Haradatta is identical with Haradatta’ the author of the
Padamañjari (c. A. D. 1100 ) the date of Rāmadevamiśra mentioned
in the Mädhaviya-Dhātuvrtti must lie between A. D. 1100 and
1350. I am, however, unable to identify this latter hafast with
his namesake, the author of the graduei commentary on the
Väsavadattā, the only Ms of which is dated A. D. 1470. Perhaps
it may be possible to identify these two authors at a later date.
1. Sarvacandra quotes the following works and authors:-
उत्तरतंत्र, उत्पलिनी, धातुप्रदीप, नागरसर्वस्व, नीतिशास्त्र, भट्टशुभाङ्क, भागुरि, रक्षितव्याख्या,
THATAT (? Ta7614T), traga, THTH ( ? THA ), 55, 9THA, QPatf1z, area,
70698131, Toquia, FOJTHT, gufa. Many popular and verna-
cular terms are also met with in the commentary of Sarvacandra
( Vide p. 1557 of 1. O. Cata. VII, 1904 ).
2. Vide CC I, 566 - apgainst comm, on Vāsavadattā by Rāma-
deva L. 2434. This is the only Ms of the work which has been
described by Rajendralal Mitra (p. 195 of Notices, VII, 1884). This
Ms was in the possession of one Babulal Pathak of Mujonā ( Zilla
Darbhanga ). It consisted of 48 folios and had an extent of 1584
Slokas. Mitra points out that this commentary is not named by Hall
in his Edition of the Vasavadattă. This Ms begins :- "HASHETTYÄ
ataathirsT I HEAD THEIT gaya ngaziget I". Colophon :- "gra
freeafsatraat araqcarta dragget WAT I SH 348 11". The
date of the Ms is Lakşmaņa Sarvat Era 352 = A. D. 1470
(352 + 1118). If this date is correct Ramadavamiśra is earlier than
A. D. 1470.

(11) Timmayasūri' - This commentator hails from South
India. I have no means of determining any limits for his date at
present.
(12) Narasimhasena? - between A. D. 1450 and 1500, if he is
identical with his namesake, whose son Visvanāthasena was at the
court of Gajapati Pratāparudra of Orissa ( A. D. 1497-1539 ). If
this identity is corroborated by further evidence it will make this
author of the Vasavadattā commentarya contemporary of Puruşot-
tamadeva ( A. D. 1470–1497 ).
------
1. Aufrecht (CC II, 133 ) notes one Ms of Timmayasūri's
commentary viz. “Govt. Ori. Ms. Library, Madras 84." The Cata.
of Madras Mss, XXI ( 1918 ), p. 8330 describes a Ms of Timmaya's
comm. called 797. In the colophon the author is styled as “ #fas-
31*FI." The Ms is written in Telugu characters. Aufrecht
(CC I, 231 ) mentions one family as the author of a commentary on
Agastya's Balabhārata ( Burnell, 1596 and Oppert II. 5745.) The
date of this family is “ beginning of the 16th Century.” A third name-
sake of our commentator is mentioned as the author of a work called
BUITEH. He is called faragha ( Vide p. 303 of Krishnamachariar:
Classical Sans. Literature, 1937). The identity of these three com-
mentators of the same name fare need to be studied with a view to
fixing their chronology.
2. Aufrecht (CC 1,566 and 278 ) records only one M8 of
Vaidya Narasimhasena's commentary on Vasavadattā viz. “Oxf.
156 6" This Ms begins,
" श्रीगुरुचरणाम्भोजं प्रणम्य पित्रो: पदं वैद्यः।
वासवदत्ताटीकां विलसत् श्रीकां करोति नरसिंहः॥"
Aufrecht also mentions ( 1, 278 ) an author of the name ATTITEHT, son
of तपन, son of उमापति, father of विश्वनाथसेन, who composed पथ्यापथ्य-
falang ( L 2939). The following points of identity between the two
afhais may be recorded here :-
be following formateret, of the name to
I. नरसिंहसेन a. of वासवदत्ताटीका - (1) calls himself वैद्य. In the
margin of the Oxford Ms he is called वैद्य नरसिंहसेन,
2. The Ms of his comm. is in Bengali Script.
II. नरसिंहसेन, father of विश्वनाथसेन-(1) He is called नरसिंहसेन by
his son STTTTTT:-

(2) The Ms of 9277927fafaa is also in Bengali script.
(3) fate was at the court of Gajapati Pratāparudra of Orissa
as stated in the colophon of q219 ha fata which reads as follows:-
"इति श्रीसर्यवंशावतंसेन गजपतिप्रतापरुद्रेण प्रतिपादितः तपनमहापात्रेति द्विजपिता-
HEATH TGATAF7 NATÀRFI at 9247922 : 41A: ” ( Vide p. 49
of Mitra's Notices, Vol. IX, 1888). The solar dynasty ! azt )
to which Gajapati Pratāpa rudra belonged ruled Orissa between
A. D. 1435 and 1540 ( Vide p. 213 of Orissa in the Making
by B. C. Mazumdar, Calcutta, 1925. Gajapati Pratāparudra ruled from
A. D. 1497 to A. D. 1539 ( Vide p. 413 of Kane: Hist. of Dharma. I ).
His predecessor Puruşottama-deva ruled from A. D. 1470 to 1497. If
FOTOT TÀI was at the court of Gajapati Pratāpa rudra between A. D.
1497 and 1539 we may safely presume that his father PTTHEAT was a
contemporary of Puruşottama deva between A. D. 1470 and 1497. I
am inclined to believe that the two persons of the same name
ATTEN, both of whom were Vaidyas of Orissa or Bengal, are
identical.
1. Aufrecht ( CC 1,566 ) records a Ms of a commentary on the
Vasavadattă called “ V yākhyāyikā by Vikramarddhi Kavi, Burnell
162a." This Ms has been described in the Des. Cata, of Tanjore
Mss, Vol. VII( 1939), pp. 3018–20 ( Ms No. 4020). The correct
name of the author is not Vikramarddhi Kavi but faiant as stated in a
verse at the beginning (त्रिविक्रमेण क्रियते मेधाविकुलजन्मना). In the extract
quoted in the Tanjore Catalogue ( p. 3019 ) there are some quotations
from the lexicon Eastya ( c. 950 A. D.). We may, therefore, presume
that this commentary is later than about 1100 A. D. Perhaps an
analysis of the only Ms of the work in the Tanjore library may
furnish better chronological limits for this author than what I can do

light on some of the obscure words in the text of the Vasavadatta
which is full of words with double meanings and hence has taxed
the heads of many commentators as would be seen from the
numerous commentaries mentioned in this paper.

1. Aufrecht ( CC III, 120 ) records only one Ms of this com-
mentary viz. “1. O. 543.” The description of this Ms as recorded
on p. 1556 of India Office Catalogue, VII, 1904, states that the Mo
contains detached annotations on the text hardly deserving the namo
of a commentary. The Ms ends :-“sfa rit BraTTTTA ETT ranat

pean ( bearing “water-mark 1805” ). The Ms is written in Bengali

on the 3176492137% of # TTA ATTTET ( Vide p. 768-9 of 1.0. Cata. IV,

following estimate of Jagaddhara's commentary on comparing it
with that of Sivarāma, published by him :-
(Preface, p. 45) - " Jagaddhara, as compared with Sivarāma,
though he oftener takes note of various readings is more diffuse, is
ćqually fanciful, and resorts less frequently to authority in justifica-
tion of his comments. His errors are freely exposed by his successor
and not invariably with unexceptionable courtesy. As I under.
stand from his introduction he was not the first annotator of
Subandhu – None older, however, seems to be now known." I
(2) By Narasimha -- Hall had only one Ms of this commentary.
Particulars about this author and his work as given by Hall may be
briefly noted here :-
(i) N ( = Narasimha ) was a physician.
(ii) N was presumably a native of Bengal.
(iii) The Ms of N's commentary with Hall was in Bengali
characters.
(iv) N's commentary is of small value as it deals more with
figures of rhetoric than with anything else.
(v) Nothing positive can be said about N's age.?
1. Hall states that the date of Jagaddhara can be deter.
mined from the following quotations in his work :-(1) TIGENTE,
(2) ITHTE, (3) TO , (4) 1971, (5) TAGST, (6) JAAT,
(7) ga, (8) fàcarital, and (9) Art. Speaking of 3706996137
Hall observes - "I have seen an imperfect copy of a storm
99 TST which was digested by some Muhammadan of note, vaguely
spoken of as “ ETT T1a.” The copy was transcribed in Samvat
1575" ( = A. D. 1519 ). Preface, p. 46. 777 is a part of tog-
भेदप्रकाश which is a supplement to विश्वप्रकाश of महेश्वर ( A. D. 1111 ).

govinda of Jayadeva is assigned to the 13th century ( Vide p. 219 of
S. K. De's Poetics, Vol. I). I have tried to prove in my article on
Jagaddhara's date that he flourished after A. D. 1300. This earlier
limit harmonises with Jagaddhara's reference to starttierace pointed
out by Hall and also with the fact that Jagaddhara wrote a commen-
tary on the Gitagovinda of which there are several M88 ( See Mithila
Mos Cata. II, 1933, Patna and Des. Cata. :of Madras Mss, XX,

2. My evidence tends to support the following chronology for
these commentators :-

3. In the foot-note on p. 47 of Preface Hall describes this
author as “A Maratha of Benares : Son of Ranganātha and pupil of
one Hari. Among his works are huge commentaries on the favorito
गदाधरी and जगदीशी. The second is called काशिका or गदाधरीविवृति ; and
the third मञ्जूषा or जगदीशतोषिणी. The गदाधरी is by गदाधरभट्टाचार्य. The
जगदीशी by जगदीशतर्कालंकारभट्टाचार्य. They annotated. respectively the
whole and a part of the girafa of TETTUTTTTA FOTHETETTU, which consists
of notes on the first two sections of sjötzt 39782ri's arafrath for, a
celebrated treatise of Nyāya philosophy.”
4. CC I, pp. 118-119 - Aufrecht states that FBUT HE BFT was the
son of Gary, brother of argetot, pupil of aft, of Benares. About 74
works of this author are recorded by Aufrecht. In CC II, 23 and
CC III, 26 he is called son of TTTT. In CC II, 114 we are told
that one रङ्गनाथ आरड son of महादेव wrote दशकुमारचरितपूर्वपीठिकासार
(Stein 81 ). If this trate is the father of EITHE 31778 the genealogy
of this author would be :-
HETìa + Son (IATA + Son 6THE ( 3477€ )
If Krşnabhatta died 150 ycars ago i.e. about A. D. 1771 according to
$. Vidyabhushan the date of Te would be about A. D. 1745 while
HETCG would have the date A. D. 1720 or so. This probable chrono.
logy as also the genealogy recorded above needs further verification
from the works of Krşpabhagga and other sources. Perhaps "STTTT"
ie a Desastha Brahmin surname.

datta is found. Satischandra Vidyabhushan in his History of Indian
Logic ( 1921 ), p. 486, states that “Krşņabhatta Arde was a Maratha
who wrote a gloss on Gadādhari called startrator and one on
Siromaņi's araraaraid while residing at Benares where he died
about 150 years ago. The gloss has been printed in Telugu
characters."
It would be seen from the above remarks of Hall on the com-
mentators of the Vasavadattă that their number as known to Hall
was three only while in our present paper we have indicated the
existence in Ms form of about 20 commentaries. It is now almost
90 years since Hall edited the Vasavadattà but no serious study of
the commentaries on this important text has been undertaken by
scholars. I trust, therefore, that my present survey of the pro-
bable chronology of some of these commentaries and indication of
the Ms material with regard to each commentary would direct
the attention of scholars to this problem at no distant date so that
some of these commentaries may be published by them gradually.'

43. Some new Evidence for the Date of the
Lexicon Medini – Between A.D. 1200 and 1275 1
Prof. Rāmāvatāra Śarmā in his scholarly Introduction to the
Kalpadrukosa' has recorded the following facts bearing on the date
of the lexicon Medini :-
(1) Rāyamukuţa ( A. D. 1431 ) quotes Medini.
(2) Padmanabhadatta, who wrote his Prșodarādivſtti in A. D.
1375, quotes Medini in his Bhūriprayoga as follows :-
“fawatirtiet#lf Diestetsaggraaft: 1
हारावलीमेदिनिकोषमन्यच्चालोक्य लक्षं लिखितं मयैतत् ॥" .
( Vide p. 192a of Aufrecht's Cata. of Oxford MSS, 1864,
where a MS of Bhüriprayoga is described ).
(3) Mallinātha ( c. A. D. 1430 ) quotes Medini on Magha II,
65 as follows:
" 87: gent gran fra Hraft"
(4) The Mankhatiká contains a quotation from Medini ( fifa
THETAFE Tesfrala 3777744TO Href: ) which, if genuine, would
push back Medini's date to the 12th century for the Mankhafika was
written before the last quarter of the 12th century.
Leaving aside the quotation from Medini in the Markhafika
composed before c. A.D. 1175 ( last quarter of the 12th century)
we may put Medini definitely between A. D. 1111, the date of
Visvakośa mentioned as aera by Medini and A. D. 1375, the date
of Padmanābhadatta, who quotes from Medini in his Bhūriprayoga.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Let us now see if we can go backwards from the definite later
limit of A.D. 1375 for the date of the Medini lexicon.
In my article on the date of Cāritravardhana I have assigned
him to the period A. D. 1172 and 1385. Prof. N. A. Gore of the
S. P. College has drawn my attention to several quotations from
Medini found in the commentary of Cāritravardhana on the
Meghadüta? of Kālidāsa. These quotations suggest the possi-
bility of a date for Medini earlier than A. D. 1350 or so. Dr. A. B.
Keith assigns Medinikara " to the fourteenth century.”
In view of the foregoing references to the date of Medinikara
made by responsible scholars we must try to fix this date within
cxact limits so that the chronology of many works which quote
Medinikara would be definitely determined and I propose to record
below some new evidence from a non-Sanskrit source which, if
accepted, definitely pushes back the date of Medini lexicon before
A.D. 1300.
scaunirara would be definitely determinary words
Dr. S. K. Chatterji published his very learned paper on " The
Varna-ratnākara of Jyotiriśvara Kavisekharācārya" in the Proceed-
ings of the Fourth Oriental Conference (Allahabad, 1928), Vol. II,
553-620. This paper is based on a MS of the Varna-ratnákara on
palm-leaf written in “m. 1. 266" i.e. in the year 388 of the
Lakşmana Samvat = A.D. 1507. This MS is preserved in the
Library of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (Govt. Collection -
No. 48/34 ). The work Varna-ratnākara is the oldest work in the
Maithili language of North Bihar so far known. Speaking of the
date of the author Dr. Chatterji makes the following observations :---
(1) The author of the V. R. (Varna-ratnākara) is a well-
known figure in medieval or late Sanskrit Literature.
1. Vide pp. 109-111 of Annals ( B. O. R. I.) 1934, Vol. XV. It
appears from Prof. Velankar's Jinaratnakośa that Căritravardhana
composed a work ( 1977 TÊTET ) in a. D. 1449 (Samvat 1505 ).
2. Vide Meghadüta ( Kashi Sanskrit Series ).
3. Vide p. 414 of Sanskrit Literature, 1928. Mr. Y. R. Date
(Vide p. 27 of महाराष्ट्रभाषाभ्यास-कोशरचनाशास्त्र व कोशवाङ्मय ) in his remarks
on Medini refers to Sir R. G. Bhandarkar's view about the date of
Medini recorded on p. 13 of the Intro. to ATACATTA ( B. S. Series,
1876). According to this view Medini belongs to the end of the 14th
Century.

(2) He wrote a prahasana or farce called the Dhurtasamdgama
and a work on erotics called the Pancasayaka. Accord.
ing to Mr. Manomohan Chakravarti our author wrote a
work called Rangasekhara (3. A. S. B., 1915, p. 414
footnote).
(3) According to Mr. Manomohan Chakravarti (J. A. S. B.,
1915, pp. 407-433 ) our author was patronized by a King
of the Karņāța dynasty of the name Harasimhadeva, who
ruled “during the first quarter of the 14th century" i. c.
between A.D. 1300 and 1325.
(4) Our author was a “ Cousin of the grandfather of Vidyā.
pati (c. A. D. 1400 )."
(5) The period during which our author flourished was tho
golden age of Sanskrit studies in Mithila of post-
Mohammadan times.
Dr. Chatterji has recorded illustrative passages from the
Varnaratnākara, which appears to be an encyclopaedic work like
the Mānasollåsa in Sanskrit by Someśvara III, the Cālukya King of
Mahārāştra ( A. D. 1127-1138). In the extract called urz quiatt (.
583 ) which records the qualifications of a HTT, or official bard of
the court, who was often a sort of ambassador to his king,
well-trained in all kinds of learning we are informed that he
should be proficient in the knowledge of 18 lexicons' viz.
(1) for, (2) fater, (3) syfes, ( 4 ) 7 arafes, (5) pha,
(6) 9887, (7) 471977, (8) 42, (9) georzat, (10) #festist,
(11 ) ETTITAT and others.
As the author of the Varparatnākara, who flourished between
A.D. 1300 and 1325, mentions Arcant lexicon as a standard lexicon
among the 18 kośas popular at the court of Mithila, we have reason
to believe that Medinikara had attained some literary status and
standing say by A.D. 1300. If this view is accepted we can safely
push back the date of Medinikara before A. D. 1275 or so. As
Medinikara mentions the Visvakośa composed in A.D. 1111 and con-
demns it as“ akcio" we are warranted in supposing that Medinikara
is removed from A.D. 1111 by about 100 years so that the date of
Medinikara gets fixed up say between A.D. 1200 and 1275. In this

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
way the reference to Medinikara in a Maithili work of c. 1320 A.D.
enables us to take back the date of Medinikara from A.D. 1375 to
1275, a period of 100 years. This is no small achievement in the
field of Indian chronology, especially when scholars have failed to
fix up the date of this much-cited lexicon during the last 75 years.
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar discussed the date of Medinī in his celebrated
edition of the Mälatīmadhava as early as 1876. He pointed out that
Jagaddhara, the commentator of this drama, himself a Maithili
author quotes Medini several times and if the date of Medini is
fixed up it would help us to fix up the date of Jagaddhara. Unfortu-
nately no Sanskrit source has yielded any definite evidence to
determine the date of Medini since 1876 and it was by mere chance
that I happened to read Dr. S. K. Chatterji's scholarly paper on
the Varnaratnākara published in 1928 and noticed the reference to
Medinikara or Medini in this early Maithili work of c. A. D. 1320
represented by a rare MS of A.D. 1507. I struggled in vain during
the last 10 years to find any definite evidence for the date of Medini
as many dates of Sanskrit works are dependent on the date of Medini.
At long last, I believe, I have brought Medini within very narrow
limits viz. A.D. 1200-1275 or 80. These limits harmonize with the
following data bearing on the date of Medinikara :-
(1) Vardhamāna, a writer on dharmaśāstra, who flourished
between A.D. 1450 and 1500 according to M. M. P. V.
Kane', quotes Afgfaast ( Vide folios 12 and 13b of a MS
of Vardhamāna's Treascara atas in the British Museum
described by Bendall - Cata. of British Mus. Mss,
1902, pp. 75-76)]. This British Museum MS of
गङ्गाकृत्यविवेक by वर्धमान is dated Laksmana Samvat
378 = 1496.
(2) Mallinātha (c. A.D.1430 ) mentions and quotes from Medini
on Māgha 11, 65 as I have already pointed out.
(3) Rāyamukuta ( A.D. 1431 ) on Amara quotes Medini several
times.
(4) Padmanabhadatta (A.D. 1375 ) quotes Medini in his
Bhūriprayoga.
(5) Jagaddhara ( Between c. 1275 and 1473:A.D. quotes Medini

The number of works quoting Medini is very large. I note be-
low some of them to enable other scholars to note similar quotations
from Medini from Sanskrit and other sources :-
(1) Rāmacandra's commentary on the Anandalahari ( B.O. R.

मेदिनी many times.

dated "ल. सं. ३७७ पौषवदि" i.e. Laksmara Samvat 377%
A.D 1495. This is perhaps the earliest dated MS of
this lexicon.
Some of the commentators of the Mahābhārata quote Medini
lexicon, but as the date of Medini was left undetermined so far I
could not make use of these quotations for chronological purposes.
I take this opportunity of noting these commentators as follows :-
(1) Narayanas in his निगढपदबोधिनी quotes मेदिनी (Vide p. 7248
of Madras Catalogue for 1925-26 to 1927-28-1935).
He mentions other commentators of the Mahābhārata
viz. वैशंपायन, देवस्वामि or देवबोध, विमलबोध, अर्जुनमिश्र,
मारायणसर्वज्ञ, शाण्डिल्य, माधव etc.

the Mbh. quotes fearrant (Vide p. 188 of Mbh.
Virāța parvan, ed. Bakre, Gujarati Press, 1915). This
quotation reads :- "99: soqqat:" fa algatat:.
This quotation has been identified by me and found
correct ( Vide p. 144 of Medinikoša ( Jivananda, 1872)].
(3) Arjunamiśra the Bengali commentator of the Mbh quotes
Medini or Medinikara several times in his comm. on
the fartregara ( Vide pp. 66, 69, 72, 74, 89, 95, 105, 116,
119, 142, 143, 146, 190 of Gujarati Press Edition, 1920,
Bombay).
I note here some views about the date of bathe noted
by me :-
(1) Holtzmann assigns A ( = Arjunamiśra ) to the 13th or 14th
century ( Vide p. 404 of Vol. I of Sukthankar Memo.
Edition, 1944 ).
(2) Dr. Sukthankar notes a Ms of A's Comm. on the STÅ
dated A.D. 1534. He says that A's date must be " long
prior to a.d, 1534. A mentions caiu, fahara, Tiszy,
#wa, TTTAS ( Vide p. 266 of Suk. Memo. Edn.
Vol. 1).
(3) Jogendra Chandra Ghosh assigns A to about A.D. 1297
(Vide pp. 706 ff. of Indian Culture, Vol. I).
(4) In my article on A (Indian Culture, Vol II. 141 ff ), I
assigned A to about 1474 A. D. This date harmoniscs
with the date a.d. 1534 of a MS of A's Comm. recorded
by Dr. Sukthankar.
In view of Medini's date (c. A.D. 1200-1275 ) now fixed by me,
I think we may safely put Arjunamiśra between c. A.D. 1350.
and 1500.
The foregoing data will amply illustrate the importance of the
date of Medini or Medini lexicon in the field of the chronology of
Sanskrit literature. I need not, therefore, record any more
references to Medini made by authors who definitely flourished
1. Trots in his comm. on the Virāțaparvan mentions
TTYFH, a tracta ( author of HTT77907), fast, and 375 (172). See

STUDIES IN INDIAN, LITERARY HISTORY
after A. D. 1600 or 80. Before closing up this paper I have to note
the following views about the date of Medini which are upset by
the date of Medini now fixed up by me :-
(1) Winternitz and Keith in describing a MS of Medini in
the Bodleian Library, Oxford, assign Medinikara to
“circa 1400", ( Vide p. 122 of Cata. of Bodleian
Library, Vol. II, Oxford, 1905 ).
(12) Zacharie (Indi. Wort. § 25) cites authorities for the
assignment of Medini to the end of the 14th Cent. A. D.
( Vide p. 169 of Bendall's Cata. of British Museum
MÁS, 1902 ).
(3) Mr. Nalini Nath Das Gupta in his article on the Bengali
commentators of the Amarakośa (Indian Culture,
October 1935, p. 264 ) makes the following remarks
about the date of Medini :-
"Since Medini, as we know, cites in his lexicon ( Medini-
koša), Madhava, the author of the Dhātuvetti grammar
and brother of Sāyaṇa ( 1360 A. D.) and is cited by
Padmanābhadatta in his Bhüriprayoga lexicon we may
without any great risk of error place him about 1375
A. D.”
As we have pushed back the date of Medini by about 100 years
from a. D. 1375, where Mr. Das Gupta has fixed it, we must
explain the reference to Madhava by Medini. Possibly this
Mādhava is not the brother of Sāyaṇa but he is identical with
Madhavakara the author of Paryāyaratnamāla ( Vide p. xi of Intro.
to Kalpadrukoša, Vol. I - G. O. Series, Baroda ).
If my view regarding the date of Medini recorded in this
paper is accepted by scholars, they will have to reject the views
of KEITH, WINTERNITZ, ZACHARIE and DASGUPTA according to which
Medini belongs to the 14th century. I am inclined to hold the
view that Medini belongs to the 13th century. I :shall, therefore,
1. In 1936 I published a paper on the date of Visvalocanakosa
of Sridharasena in the Karnatak Historical Review, Vol. III, pp.
15-20. In this paper I observed as follows :
.: As Medini refers to and criticizes Visvaprakāśa (A, D, 1111 )

DATE OF THE LEXICON MEDINI

welcome any evidence from other scholars which either confirms
this view or contradicts it, provided their evidence is of a con-
temporary character and hence not open to doubt or argument.
In the light of the evidence brought forth by me in this paper
we have to reject the following statements of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar
regarding the date of Medinī made by him in his Preface to the
Mālatīmādhava :-
(1) "Medinikara, therefore, lived after about 1375 A. D.”
( Vide p. xxi). I have proved in this paper that
Medinikara is earlier than A. D. 1275.
(2) “Probably Medinikara lived about the same time as
Mallinātha ” (Ibid ).
This is not correct as Mallinātha flourished about A. D. 1430
while Medini is earlier than Mallinātha by more than
150 years. Mallinātha composed a work for Devarāya
II of Vijayanagar ( A. D. 1422-1466 ).
(3) “Medinī, therefore, very probably lived after Mallinātha”
(Ibid, p. XX). This statement has also been dis-
proved by my evidence as Niedini is earlier than
Mallinātha by more than 150 years.
At one place Sir R. G. Bhandarkar states that Medini " lived
about the same time as Mallinātha " while at another place he
observes that Medini "lived after Niallinātha.” These contradic-
tory statements only show the divided state of Bhandarkar's mind
which then found no fulcrum of fact on the strength of which he
could lift up the problem of Medini's date from the slippery
ground of relative chronology, made more slippery by the grease
of groundless guesswork and absence of reliable evidence. I have
dealt with Bhandarkar's view about the date of Aledinī with a view
to directing the attention of scholars to new evidence on the old
problem and not out of any want of deference to the grandfather
of Oriental learning on whose shoulders we stand and carry on our
research with a wider vision and new tools not available to his
generation.
( Continued from previous page )
and as he is quoted in thc Pļşodarādivștti of Padmanābhadatta ( A. D.
1375 ) we may not be far wrong if we assign him to the thirteenth
century."
This surmise about the date of Medini stands substantiated by
the evidence recorded in this paper.

44. Some new Evidence from the Rasaratna-
pradīpa of Rāmarāja on the Genealogy of the
Tākā Kings of Kāşthā --
Between A. D. 1200 and 1500 $
Prof. P. V. Kane in his section on Madanapāla and Visveśvara-
bhatta ( History of Dharmaśāstra Vol. I, 1930 ) deals with the genea-
logy of Madanapāla. He observes :-
“Madanapāla belonged to the family of ļākā Kings that ruled
in Kāsthā ( modern Kath) on the Jumna to the north of Delhi.'
The printed Madana pārijāta makes the family name to be
'Kasthā', but this is inost probably a wrong reading as in the
Mahārņava and other works of Madanapāla the family name is dis-
tinctly stated to be ſākā. The pedigree of the family as gathered
from the N1adanapārijāta and the other works is given below.
Some works such as the Mahārņava omit the mention of Sahaja-
pāla. About Sādhāraņa it is said that he brought about the remis-
sion of all taxes at the three tirthas ( Prayāga, Kāśi and Gayā ).” ?

sors' or descendants but for this purpose it is necessary for us to
know as complete a genealogy of the ļākā dynasty of Kāşthā as
can be revealed by documentary evidence. The documentary
evidence for extending the genealogy of the Tākā race further
than the time of Jeaiho mentioned last in Prof. Kane's statement
of this genealogy recorded above is fortunately forthcoming from
a MS of a medical work called the रसरत्नप्रदीप ( by रामराज ) of which
three MSS only are recorded by Aufrecht. The fourth MS of this
work is mentioned by Petersons in his Catalogue of Ulwar MSS.
The MS in Aufrecht's entry “ Peters 4.40 (incl.)” = No. 1079 of
1886-92 in the Government MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute,
Poona. It has been described by Dr. Har Dutt Sharma on
pp. 247 - 249 of his Descriptive Cata. of Vaidyaka MSS ( B. O. R.
1.- Vol. XVI, Part I, 1939). Dr. Sharma makes the following
remarks about the author of the work :-.
“ The author seems to belong to a royal family. He calls his
1. The predecessors of Madanapāla according to the genealogy
reconstructed by Prof. Kane are Th975, H7E913, TT and #1917.
Aufrecht records no MSS of works ascribed to these predecessors.
There is a work called धर्मसंग्रह composed by उपाध्याय हरिश्चन्द्र (CC I, II,
p. 58 ) about A. 1). 1850 under TIHTÄT of the Jaipur dynasty ( Vide my
article in Poona Orientalist, Vol. II, p. 178), but this work has nothing
to do with the Tākā race. Aufrecht (CC I, 707) mentions Grattuta
as the author of मुक्तावली on Hala's गाथासप्तशती; but this King is the son
of 77 and grandson of a1103 and hence different from Madana-
pāla's father साधारण. Aufrecht does not ascribe any works to सहजपाल

father's name is Tiagra and he was in the services of his grandfather
named ATETTUT."
Verses 1 to 9 at the beginning of the MS record the genealogy
of the author which may be represented as follows:--

called the faza )

( Forat)
( verse 8 ) — 7?atra
( verse 9 )-Son
रामराज
( author of paragata)
The above genealogy is very important as it adds the following
names to Prof. Kane's genealogy of the Kāşthā Kings of the Tākā
race :-
(1) लक्ष्मणसिंह, the eldest brother of मदनपाल not mentioned by
Prof. Kane.
(2) Tati, a descendant of Haq.
(3) JTHITH, the son of 71974 and author of the TATA &19.
A question now arises as regards the chronology of TIATIF and his
father Tragra. For deciding this question we have to record the
following evidence :-
1. Though Dr. Sharma makes PIATTO the grandson of A1a1707 it is
not possible to accept this statement. In the first place Dr. Sharma
has ignored #Tato mentioned in verse 7. The name of 7777915 in
verse 8 is introduced as follows after the mention of #ga in verse 7 :-
" *2154 fa falta 99269175 1 915849 etc. " i.e. in the line of #ga and
his predecessors was born रत्नपाल etc. The expression " वंशेऽथ " raises
a doubt about the exact relation of ACH with 7779133. I have, therefore,
indicated this relation by a dotted line, leaving the question of this
relationship open for further investigation. It is, however, certain
that our रामराज remembered a fragment of his genealogy from हरीचन्द्र
to मदन and from रत्नपाल to himself.

GENEALOGY OF THE TĀKĀ KINGS

(1) According to Aufrecht (CC I, 496) an anonymous
Medical work Tatiana has been quoted in the following works :-
(i) Yogatarangiņī of Trimalla.
(ii) Bhāvaprakāśa of Bhāvamiśra (c. A.D. 1550 ).
(iii) ļoờarānanda ( between A.D. 1565 and 1589 - See Kane's
History of Dh., Vol. I, p. 423 )
The only other medical work of the name again of known
authorship is that by THTIT. I am, therefore, inclined to presume
that the waygin mentioned and quoted in the three works viz.
the Yogatarangiņi, Bhāvaprakaśa and the podarānanda is identical
with the TATHIET of TIHTS belonging to the Tākā line of Kings.
If this suggestion is accepted, I have to state that the chronology of
Rāmarāja and his work becomes earlier than 4.1). 1550 or so, when
it is quoted by Bhāvaniśra in his medical compendium called the
Bhāvaprakāśa. We have now to go backwards from A.1). 1550. For
this purpose the date of the Yogatarangiņī of Trimalla which
mentions the 7777777ctq is important. About this date the follow-
ing evidence is available :-
Prof H. D. Velankar' while describing a MS of Trimalla's
Dravyagunaśataślokī observes as follows :-
( “ Trimalla quotes Vīrasimhāvaloka ( 1383 A.D.) in his Yogataran-
giņī and a MS of his Dravyaguņaśataśloki ( Mitra, Notices, Vol. I, p.
109, No. 203 ) is dated Samvat 1555, i.e. A.1), 1499. Trimalla's date.
therefore, falls between 1353 and 1499 A.D.''
Prof. Velankar further states :--" Rasaratnapradipa, a work of
Trimalla's son is quoted in the famous ?odarānanda, Cf. Bendall,
Brit. Mus. Sk. NISS, p. 212.''
Bendall's statement “ Rasaratnapradipa, a work of Trimalla's
son” is wrong. Bendall has evidently confused Rasapradipa (by
Trimalla's son Samkarabhatta ) with the Rasaratnapradipa quoted
by Todarānandą. Aufrecht does not mention any raagain by
Trimalla's son 13THE but he mentions 198ro by Trimalla's son
which is not a medical work but an anthology2 in three chapters. I
have already suggested that the T ag 19 quoted by ?odarānanda,
1. Vide p. 59 of Cata. of BBRAS MSS, Vol. 1 (1925).
2. CC 1, 495 — “14619 an anthology in 3 Chapters by

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Yogatarangini and Bhāvaprakāśa is most probably the work of
Rāmarāja of the Țākā line of Kings.
The reference to the TATATERT in Trimalla's work composed
between A.D. 1383 and 1499 enables us 10 push back the date of the
Tauto of Rāmarāja up to about A.D 1475, which may be regarded
as the later limit for Rāmarāja, the earlier limit being A.D. !375, the
date of #99975 in whose line Rāmarāja's father 769r was born
("ase faufaica T atra : 1977ana etc.”) as stated in the MS of
the Taranto (No. 1079 of 1886-92).
The genealogy of the 'I'ākā Kings of Kāşthā may now be con-
solidated as follows :---
traurs ( C. A. D. 1250).
HET ( C. A. D. 1275).
Efter (or afga - C. A. D. 1300 ).
FEITOT C. A. D. 1325).

quotes Tatagare ]
( author of tAtingeto)
It will be seen from the above consolidated genealogy that the
name 77797 which is the first name in the genealogy is again
repeated after about 200 years. This genealogy, also shows
how we have been able to extend the known genealogy of Madana-
pāla by about 100 years. The rule of the Tākā Kings of Kāșthâ
for a continuous period of 300 years is thus proved on documentary
evidence. We must now investigate the history of this Tākā line
of Kings before Ratnapāla (c. A. D. 1250) and after Rāmarāja
:c. A. D. 1450), the author of the Rasaratnapradipa.

45. Studies in the History of Indian Cosmetics
and Perfumery - A critical Analysis of a rare
Manuscript of Gandhavāda and its Marāthī
Commentary - Between c. A. D. 1350 and 1550 1
In a paper contributed by me to the Journal of the Bombay
University,' I have given a critical analysis of a rare treatise on the
science of cosmetics and perfumery represented by a single MS
in the Raddi Collection of the Bhandarkar O. R. Institute, Poona.
This work is called the Gandhasāra by Gangādhara. In the same
bundle in which I discovered the Gandhasāra there is another work
written in the same hand called the Gandhavāda with a Marathi

The MS containing these two treatises viz. (1) the Gandha-
sära and the Gandhavāda with Bhāşà commentary appears to be
about 200 years old, judging by the condition of the paper on
which it is written and also its script. The questions about the
authorship and chronology of these two treatises may now be dis-
cussed as follows ;--
(1) Is it possible to suppose that the treatise Gandhavāda is
also the work of Gangādhara, the author of the Gandhasāra ?

Page 340****************************************************************************************
A RARE MANUSCRIPT OF GANDHAVADA
301
There is no definite evidence to answer this question in the
positive or negative.
(2) Who is the author of the Bhāṣā or Marathi commentary
on the Gandhavāda in Sanskrit ?
This question also cannot be answered definitely though it is
possible to suppose that the author of the Gandhavāda himself
composed the Marathi commentary on his own work.
(3) What is the chronology of both these works and the Bhāșă
commentary?
All these three texts are certainly more than 200 years old.
This inference based on the condition of the manuscript and its
script finds corroboration from the old Marathi language of the
commentary. At any rate the form of the Marathi language of the
commentary will provide us some criterion to fix its chronology
approximately. I note below some words and expressions from
the commentary to enable scholars to fix its chronology :-
- येला (27)
- होए, होये (28)
- तू तलौनि ( 27 )
- जाए (30)
- घालिजे, कीजे (33)
- वासु दीजे ( 27 ), भावना दीजे,
- भिजों दीजे (33)
(fol. 28), किजे (29),
- रसें वाटिजे (33)
वालविजे (32)
--- गंधराज (43)
-- राजे ठाकुरु (34)
- उतरलिया मेलविजे ( 34 )
-तिलेल (45)
- दारचिनी (35), दारूचिनी ( 36 ) - तेणें भिजौनु कलै घालुनु (46)
चोखट (35)
-- चोखटु (16)
खोबरें जुनें (38)
- वातिया होति (47)
हातं मदौंनि पाणि सांडिजे (40)
-~- खदिराचा डीकु (42)
- चूर्ण करुनु खलिजे ( +7)
- ऊद मेलवणि (48)
- सिलारसु मधु पाण्ये कालविजे ( 47 )
Judging by the above forms of the Marathi language of the
commentary I may tentatively assign this commentary to the latter
half of the 15th century or the middle of the 16th century A.D.
The Marathi commentary is useful linguistically because it
gives us the vernacular equivalents for some of the Sanskrit terms

The foregoing tables with the exception of the last one are
perhaps intended to help the actual manufacture of perfumes.
They give at a glance the several aromatic ingredients and their
suggested combinations. The elaborate table on folio 20b specifies
the proportions of these ingredients. It is for the Indian manu-
facturers of perfumes to understand their exact significance and
compare these proportions with those now in practice.
I now close this paper by noting below the names of materials
mentioned in the Marathi commentary on the Gandhavāda :-

The foregoing analysis of the Marathi commentary reveals in
detail the variety of aromatic and other materials that were used in
Medieval India for the manufacture of cosmetics and perfumery.
Additional points furnished by this analysis are the following :-
(1) Sanskrit and other terms and their equivalents are record-
ed as follows :-
"हेम म्हणता अगुरु,” " क्रिमिजंतु म्हणता लाख."
(2) Bhojarāja mentioned on folio 38 in the expression
भोजराजकृतवादि " is evidently King Bhoja of Dhara (c.
A.D. 1050).
(3) Singhana referred to on folio 30 as the originator of a बुका
powder is possibly identical with the Yādava King
सिंहण (A.D. 1210-1247).

Page 347****************************************************************************************

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
(4) It appears that glass-vessels were used in connection with
the manufacture of perfumery. Taft or glass-bottle
is mentioned on folio 34. fra977 or a glass-vessel is
referred to on folios 39 and 40.
(5) A piece of woollen blanket was used as a strainer (“mia.
za orgia Àg " Folio 38 ).
(6) As regards the THAIST ( Folios 40 and 45 ) and the arear-
15 ( Folio 45 ) referred to in the commentary please
see Plate IV (21 and 22 ) in the Short History of Aryan
Medical Science, by Thakore Saheb of Gondal, London,
1896.
(7) There are references to Cinnamon as great (Folio 35 )
and grenaa ( Folio 36). Ilobson-Jobson ( by Yule and
Burnell, 1903 ) states that Darcheenee is a Persian word
meaning China-stick. It records usages of dar-chini,
dated A.D. 1563 and 1021.
(8) There are references to the word "aiat" in the com-
mentary ( Vide Folio 38 -"TITE TH") meaning "the
dried kernel of the cocoanut ” which is called in
English Coprah ( vide llobson-Jobson, pp. 253-254 where
we get dated usages of the word like - Copra (A.D.
1563, 1578 ); Chopra ( A.D. 1584), etc.).
In view of the data recorded above I am inclined to fix the date
of the Gandhavāda and its Marathi commentary between A.D. 1350
and 1550 tentatively. This date is consistent with the reference to
King Singhana ( A.D. 1210-1247) and the old forms of the Marathi
language, not to say the present condition of the MS and its script.
I hope that the students of historical linguistics and the students of
the history of Perfumery industry of medieval India will fully
exploit the rich contents of these new sources for their study
viz. the (1) Gandhasāra of Gangādhara and the (2) Gandhavāda
with Marathi commentary.

limits for his date, viz. A. D. 1192 and and 1385 and also examined
a MS of this commentary in the Library of the B. B. R. A. Society
( No. B. D. 131 ) which is fragmentary and which was not known
to Aufrecht. I also referred in my note to a MS of Janārdana's
commentary on the Meghadūta deposited in a temple at Cambay
and described by Peterson in his Third Repori ( p. 324). It was
also pointed out that only one MS of Janārdana's commentary on
the Raghuvamśa has been recorded by Aufrecht, viz. “ B. 2. 100”
but this is not available for study.
No complete MS of Janārdana's commentary on the Raghu-
vansa has yet been available to me, and hence I am eager to avail
myself of any MSS of Janārdana's works that could be noticed in
different MSS catalogues or would be reported by scholars here.
after. Since writing the note about Janārdana above referred to I
obtained on loan through the courtesy of the Director of the Adyar
MSS library another fragmentary MS of Janārdana's commen-
tary on the Raghuvamsa ( Eastern Section, No. 36- F. 42). This
MS contains Janārdana's Bhāşya on the Raghuvanića for Sargas XII
to XVIII and to a certain extent supplements the B. B. R. A.
Society MS No. B. D. 131 referred to above. One great peculi-
arity about the Adyar MS is that it contains explanations in Guja-
räti of certain words and expressions of the text.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Mr. T. M. Tripathi in his learned Introduction to the Tarka-
sangraha' of Anandajñāna ( = Anandagiri = Janārdana ) sur-
mises that Anandagiri or Janārdana was probably a native of
Gujarat. He further states that he is 'tempted to identify' him
( Janārdana or Anandagiri ) with Pandita Janārdana, the author of
a commentary on the Meghadūta called partcai and a commentary
on the Raghuvamsa. ? Janārdana consulted previous commen-
taries of Asada ( A. D. 1192), Vallabha ( A. D. 1163) and Sthira-
deva. The peculiarity of these commentaries is that besides
giving explanations and occasionally figures of speech and parallel
passages they are intermingled with meanings of the text-words in
the (old) Gujarati language also. These appear to be early
atttempts of Anandagiri.
going par oraha I can VO MS of the Adyar Me
Though I cannot subscribe in toto to the contents of the fore-
going paragraph from Mr. Tripathi's valuable introduction to the
Tarkasargraha I can vouch them in certain respects only on the
strength of the Adyar MS of the commentary of Janārdana on
the Raghuvamśa. For example the Adyar MS contains Gujarati
explanations intermingled with Sanskrit commentary throughout
the MS as will be clear from the following extract of the colophon
of this MS :-
"प्रतिकृतरचनाभ्योदूतसंदर्शिताभ्यः ।

2. Mr. Tripathi states that he has fragments of this commentary
in his possession. There is of a later origin another similar com.
mentary on the Raghuvamśa giving also explanations in Gujarāti by
Samala, son of Luniga, a Nagara Brahman by caste श्रीमन्नागरपाटवोऽतिनिपुणः

The above extract containing vernacular explanations side by
side with Sanskrit commentary is typical of the entire Adyar MS
and hence there is reason to believe that the author of the verna-
cular explanations and of the Sanskrit commentary is one and the
same person viz. Janārdana. This inference is supported by the
MS of Meghadūtabhāșya of Janārdana described by Peterson in
his Third Report, p. 325, where, as pointed out by Mr. Tripathi the
following Sanskrit and vernacular explanations of some text-words
have been recorded :-
"विगलितशुचौ विगलितो गतः शोको ययोः तो विगलित गिउ
JT IT sta ga olami Arachrapt etc."
Without subscribing to Mr. Tripathi's proposed identification
of Janārdana or Anandajñāna or Anandagiri with Janārdana, the
commentator of the Raghuvamśa and the Meghadūta, we may agree
with him in his surmise that our commentator was a resident of
Gujarat and wrote a mixed Sanskrit-Gujarāti commentary on the
Raghuvaſſa and the Meghadīta.
Not being a student of old or, modern Gujarāti myself, I am
unable to assess fully the value of the vernacular portion of the
Adyar MS. Its importance to a student of Gujarāti philology is
obvious from the fact that Janārdana wrote his commentary be.
tween A. D. 1191 and 1385. This was a period when the verna-
culars were looked down upon. Anandabodha ( about A. D.
1150 )', a great writer on Advaita philosophy, incidentally refers to
the two vernaculars viz. the Canarese and the Gujarati as
" Bafas" in his celebrated work the Nyāyamakaranda.? As
Janārdana wrote his commentaries after A. D. 1191 and before
A. D. 1385 and as he adopts a bilingual method of explanation, the
vernaculars, and in particular the Gujarāti language, must have
attained a better status than that apparent in Anandabodha's refer-
ence to the Canarese and the Gujarāti language referred to above.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
According to Rao Bahadur C. V. Vaidya '' modern Gujarati like
Marathi begins about 1500 A. D. ' and if this statement is correct
the Gujarāti used by Janārdana in his present commentary repre-
sented by the Adyar MS will have to be considered as old Gujarati,
because Janārdana's date falls between 1191 and 1385 A. D. Perhaps
a glossary of Sanskrit words with their old Gujarāti explanations
as found in the Adyar MS fragment (about 173 pages) will reveal
the nature of the language current in Gujarat in Janārdana's time.
But such a study is outside the scope of this paper.
We now proceed with our analysis of the Adyar MS. The MS
begins with folio 242. It is, therefore, clear that the first 241
folios of this valuable MS have been lost. The portion of the com-
mentary which begins on folio 242 pertains to Canto XII as we find
the following verse concluding this canto on folio 250 :-
" कालिदासकृतावर्कवंशकीर्ती कृतिप्रियां
व्याकृति द्वादशस्येमां विततार जनार्दनः॥"
Folio 268 is missing. Canto XIV begins on folio 269. The
concluding verse of Canto XIV reads as under on folio 289 :-
" यत्रारभ्य दिलीपभूपतिपतिं तिग्मांशुवंशोद्भवं
राजन्यं रघुराजरत्नविलसत् श्रीरामनामाद्भुतम् ।
व्याचल्ये किल कालिदाससुकविः काव्ये कलौ कार्तिके
व्याचक्रेऽत्र चतुईशं मतिवशं सगं जनानंदनः॥"
Canto XV begins on folio 290 — with the following verse :-
" भक्त्या यत्पदनुग्रहं बलमलं विष्टभ्य विश्रंभते
निष्यांसं स्वधिया मया तनुधियाथारभ्यते यद्रसात् ।
स्मृत्या सर्वमनीषितार्थवरदो देवो महेशात्मजो
निःप्रत्यूहमिदं सभाप्यमखिलं सिद्धिं नयत्वाशु मे ॥"
3. See C. V. Vaidya's article on Gujarati in relation to Marathi'
in the Proceedings of the 7th Oriental Conference, Baroda ( 1935), pp.
1075.1083 ---- Hemacandra's grammar furnishes written evidence of the
form of Gujarāti in the 12th century A. D. The words Gujarat and
Gujarāti had not come into existence in the days of Hemacandra.
North Gujarat was called ATTFTTHES and the South Gujarat was call-

JANARDANA'S COMMENTARY ON RAGHUVAŃSA
313
Folios 292-302 are missing. Chapter xv continues on folio
303 and ends as under on folio 319 —
" श्रीमद्राघवराजस्य चरिते काव्येऽस्य काव्यांबुधे
___ संसस्सत्कविकालिदासरचिते स्फूर्जद्गणालंकृतेः ।

Folios 336 10 338 are again missing and Canto XVII begins on
folio 339. Folios 346 and 347 are also missing. Folio 353 is miss-
ing and some chapter appears to begin on folio 354 with the fol-
lowing verse :-
" भक्त्या यत्पदनुग्रहं बलमलं विष्टभ्य विभूभते
निर्व्यासं स्वधिया तथा तनुधियाथारभ्यते यद्रसात् ।
स्मृत्या सर्वमनीषितार्थवरदो देवो महेशात्मजो
निःप्रत्यूहमिदं सभाष्यमखिलं सिद्धि नयत्वाशु मे ॥"
This verse is identical with the verse introducing Canto XV as
quoted above.
The concluding verse of Canto XVIII reads on folio 365 as
follows:
" महार्थोपमालावररत्नप्रसूती
र......णां महाकाव्यसंपूर्णधी
गंभीरे जनानंदनानंदनार्थ
बुधानां तद्दष्टादशे भाष्ये सेतुं बबंधः ॥"
On folio 3650 - the following endorsement shows the name of
the owner of this fragment - रघुवंशटीका गोविंददशपुचस्य तृ (७) टितेयं."
Obviously stifác cng obtained the present MS in a fragmentary
condition. Another endorsement in bold hand and different ink on
folio 365° but written breadthwise records Saivat 1768 as under :-
" स्वस्ति श्रीमन्नृपविक्रमार्कसमयातीत संवत् १७६८ वर्षे आषाढ वदि २ बुधके"
It is difficult to say if Samvat 1768 ( = A.D. 1712) is the date
of the Adyar MS. Perhaps the endorsement might have been added
by some one later. At any rate it proves that the Adyar MS is
older than A.D. 1712 or roughly we may say that it is about 250
years old.
References made by Janārdana to earlier works and authors
in the portion of his commentary represented by the Adyar MS
are :-

1. Abhinanda or Gauda Abhinanda, son of Bhatta Jayanta, wrote
the कादंबरीकथासार and योगवासिष्ठसार. He was a contemporary of Raja-
sekhara Circa A. D. 900 ( F. W. Thomas' Introduction to Kavindra-
vacanasamuccaya, p. 20). Gauda Abhinanda is different from Abhi.
nanda ( son of Satānanda) who wrote the रामचरित. The अभिनंदकाव्य
referred to by Janārdana is identical with tharta which deals with
the history of Rama. The date of Abhinanda, the author of रामचरित,
was hitherto unknown (see Keith's History of Sanskrit Literature,
p. 135 ) but Mr. K. S. Ramaswami Shastri in his learned introduction
to the edition of the Rāmacarita (Gaikwar Ori. Series, No. XLVI,
1930, Baroda) has proved that Abhinanda, the author of the रामचरित;
was the court-poet of king Devapāla alias Haravarşa Yuvarāja (bet-
ween 800 and 900 A. D.) - page xxi. See also Dr. V. Raghavan's
note on the Rāmacarita ( Annals, Vol. XVI, pp. 141-2).

There are many more anonymous quotations in the present MS
than those recorded in the above list of references. On the whole
Janārdana is not in the habit of naming the author from whose works
he quotes a stanza or two occasionally. Almost all the references
noted above are taken from comparatively old works and hence
they don't furnish any definite chronological clues for narrowing
down our present limits for Janārdana's date viz. A.D. 1191 and
1385. The quotation from अभिनंदकाव्य i.e. रामचरित by अभिनंद given
by Janārdana and identified by me above is chronologically in har-
mony with the above limits because the date of Hic it falls be-
tween 800 and 900 A.D.
Since my note on the Janārdana's commentary was published
Dr. V. G. Paranjpe of the Fergusson College has published his
critical edition of the Meghadūta' with the commentary of ffertaa
based on a rare MS found in the Mandlik Collection of the Fergus-
son College, Poona, bearing the date Samvat 1521 (= A.D 1465 ).
Janardana mentions स्थिरदेव by name in the line “स्थिरदेववल्लभासहकृतानि
97162mzalantaarra” (Cambay MS) as pointed out by me in my
previous note. I shall now point out that he has modelled one of
his verses on fertiga's verse in the beginning of his commentary.
In fact he has repeated forca's verse almost verbatim as will be
seen from the following comparison :-
1. Meghadüta with Sthiradeva's commentary, edited by Dr. V.
G. Paranjpe, M.A., D.Litt., Poona; 1935, Price Rs. 2.

About the date of स्थिरदेव Dr. Paranjpe observes :- Sthiradeva
lived in times when critics were under the influences of the
Alamkara school. He has quoted passages from भामह, दण्डी, रुद्रट
and उद्भट ......... he must be placed at the end of the 9th century or
at the outset of the tenth'. If this date for ferica is correct it would
make स्थिरदेव a contemporary of अभिनंद, the author of the रामचरित
(800 to 900 A.D.) which जनार्दन quotes in his commentary on the
Raghuvamsa.

47. Aruņadatta and Hemādri, the Commen-
tators of the Aştāngahỉdaya I
Mr. K. A. Padhye in his Life of Hemādri (in Marāthī) pub-
lished in 1931, ( Bombay) p. 4?, while dealing with the works of
Hemādri, the minister of Kings, Mahādeva and Rāmacandra of
Devagiri, makes the following statement about the relative chrono-
logy of Hemādri and Aruņadatta, who wrote the commentaries on
the Așțāngahrdaya of Vāgbhata II called the Ayurvedarasāyana,
and Sarvārgasundarā, respectively :-
Page 34, lines 21-22-“In the commentary by Aruņadatta on
the Așțāngahrdaya no mention of Hemādri appears to have been
made ” (translation ours ).
The above statement presumes among other things that Hemā-
dri was prior in point of date to Aruņadatta. This presumption of
Mr. Padhye is definitely wrong because Aruņadatta and Hemādri
flourished about A. D. 1220' and 12602 respectively. Obviously,
therefore, Aruņadatta could not refer to a medical writer of Hemā-
dri's repute even if he had desired to do so, as such a reference
would result in an anachronism. Perhaps Mr. Padhye was not
aware of this chronology of the two commentators. Dr. Hoernle
and Mr. Kane have recorded sufficient evidence for the dates
“ about A. D. 1220” and “ A. D. 1260 ” for Aruņadatta and
Hemādri respectively. I shall, therefore, record in this note some
additional evidence in support of these dates. This evidence
is furnished by the following extracts from Hemādri's Ayurveda-
rasāyana and the Sarvāngasundarā of Arunadatta :--
(1) Aruņadatta - “ AST, AY-Igla, #i-atina"
I Journal of the University of Bombay, Vol. III, Pt. III, pp. 26-27.

Hemādri, ed. by Paradkar-shastri, N. S. Press, Bombay, page 136,

(2) Hemādri -
“ #Yigh' href='FUEOFA:
“#777'aurea:' gra giga: ' ASETTAT: '

From the comparison of the two extracts recorded above it is
clear that Hemādri mentions Aruņadatta by name and quotes from
him and further Hemādri's quotation from Aruņadatta's text stands
identified, proving thereby that Hemādri is quoting from the Sar-
vāngasundarā and from no other work ascribed to any other name-
sake' of Arunadatta. The difference of about 40 years between the
dates of Aruņadatta and Hemādri explains the possibility of a
junior author quoting from a senior contemporary of repute. It
also appears from the above extract that by the time Hemādri com-
posed his Ayurvedarasāyana, Arunadatta had already attained some
reputation as a commentator of the Așțārgahrdaya. It is not,
however, clear whether Aruņadatta and Hemādri were contem-
poraries even for the smallest period of their lives as mere men-
tion of a writer's name cannot prove this point.

on architecture called Manusyālaya Candrikā is also ascribed to
· Aruņadatta ( see Oppert's Catalogue, 2658, 2942, 6103 ). The identity
or otherwise of these namesakes of the author of the Sarvänga.

48. Date of Vimalabodha's Commentary on
the Mahābhārata called the Vişamaślokī
--- after 1150 A. D. I
Dr. V. S. Sukthankar in his recent article on the comment-
ators of the Mahābhārata states that Arjunamiśra mentions Vima-
labodha and Vimalabodha cites Devabodha and hence we get the
series : Devabodha Vimalabodha-Arjunamiśra. As the date of
Vimalabodha's commentary has not yet been fixed by scholars
I propose in this note to analyse a Ms of his commentary called the
Visamaśloki viz. No. 84 of 1869-70 in the Govt. Mss Library at
the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, referred to by Dr. Sukthankar in his
article mentioned above. This Ms consists of about 88 folios and
bears the date Saka 1724 ( = A. D. 1802). It was copied at Poona
by one Krsnabhat Sivarāina Sivanekar from some original, which he
complains (in the colophon) was extremely incorrect. Vimala-
bodha refers to the following authors and works in his

In the above references the colophon on fol. 65 quoted by me
does not appear to have formed part of Vimalabhodha's commentary
and this conclusion is proyed by its absence in another Ms of
Vimalabodha's commentary viz. No. 167 of 1887-91 of the Govt. Mss
Library, where on folio 49 we have the following brief colophon
"एते राजधर्मस्थाविषमाः श्लोकाः." Evidently the colophon on folio 65
of Ms No. 84 of 1869-70, which ascribes definitely the authorship
of "महाभारततात्पर्यायविवरणटीका'' to one त्रिविक्रम (styled as " महापौरा-
णिकोपाध्याय ") is wrongly inserted in the present Ms. Aufrecht in
his Catalogus Catalogorum does not mention any commentator
of the name fare as the author of a commentary described in the

above-mentioned colophon. In the list of 22 commentators on
the Nlahābhārata given by Dr. Sukthankar in his Epic Studies' no
commentator of the name faragh has been recorded.?
We now come to the question of the chronological limits for
Vimalabodha's commentary. Dr. Sukthankar has already given us
the series “ Devabodha 'imalabodha" Arjunamiśra” which states
the relative chronological position of the three commentators. In
the list of references recorded above, the relcrences to “J ”
on folio 6+, to“ HTTIJ” and his “ ETTEITAF3771 ” on folio 63 and
to" przáizira70"' on folio 74 enable us to fix one terminus to
the date of Vimalabodha's commentary. As king Bhojal of Dharā
is assigned to a period - 1010 A 1), to 1055 A. 1).and as i.). 100."
is considered is a limit for his cate“ we may not be wrong in fixing
about 1150 A. D. as one terminus for the date of Vimalabocha's
commentary on the Nahābhārata.

2. Whether for EA was another name of Vimalahodha in tile
grhasthāśrama ( householder's life ) is a matter for investigation. We
may cite as an analogy the name FATIT, which was the name of
Anandajñāna, the author of the Tarkasarigraha (G. (). Series, Baroda )
in the grhasthāśrama.

49. References to Persian Oil in Bilhana's
Vikramāňkadeya - Carita and in the Ārya-
mañjuśrī - Mülakalpa ---- Between c. A. D. 500
and 1100 1
In the Marathi Dictionary Sabdakośa ( by Y. R. Date and C. G.
Karve, Poona, 1938, p. 2601 ) we get the following information
about Rock oil or Kerosene oil:--
"prav, --- gaz; herää
(Rock = 75+ oil = .)”
Page 1088 -- "gid - ärisira at:7; Errata; prasme
(Gas = ar + a)
These entries create an impression that Rock-oil or Kerosene oil
was unknown to Indians at any stage of their history till the British
advent.
In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary we get the following
entries about this oil and allied terms:--
l'age 1746 --- Rock oil, native naptha.
Page 1309 - Naptha --- ( 1572 ) - Latin and Greek --- perhaps
of Oriental origin. A name originally
applied to an inflammable volatile
liquid (a constituent of asphalt and
bitumen ) issuing from Vie earth in
certain localities, etc.
Page 1081 -- Kerosene -- ( 1854 ) --- A mixture of liquid
hydrocarbons obtained by the distilla-
tion of patroleum ; also from coal and
bituminous shale ; extensively used its
a lamp-oil; the usual name is paraffin
oil or paraffin.
Page 1428 --- Paruflin oil -- Any one of several oils obtained by
distillation of coal, patroleum, etc., and
used as illuminants and lubricants;
also called simply paraffin, K'erosene or
petroleum.
The above entries furnish no historical information about the
Rock oil or Kerosene oil, with which I am concerned in this paper.
In the Marathi Encyclopedia called the Yſana-Kośa (by Dr.
S. V. Ketkar ) Vol. 19 ( 1926 ) Poona p. () 39 we get some in-
formation about the Rock oil as follows:-

REFERFNCES TO PERSIAN OIL IN SANSKRIT WORKS

"Rock-oil has been in use from very ancient times. In China
it was used for lamps and as fuel from ancient times. In Egypt it
was used for mummies. In Biblical mythology Noah's ark is said
to have been painted with tar produced from rock-oil.
On our side the rock-oil is found in urma and Persia. At
present we have rock-oil fields in the Panjab.”
In the above remarks we don't find any information about the
knowledge of the Rock-oil, if any, possessed by Indians in ancient
or mediæval periods of history.
On 31st August, 19.16, my friend Dr. V. S. Agrawala, Superin-
tendent, Central Asian Intiquities Museum, New Delhi, wrote 10
me as follows :---
" The Vikramārkadeva-Carita of Bilhana was first published by
Dr. Biihler in the Bombay Sanskrit Series......... In a new edition of
this book from Benares I find in Canto IX, verse 21), a reference to
Pārasika oil ( SIIH ). I interpret it as clear reſerence to
Kerosene oil obtained from Persian oil-fields which, it appears,
was being imported into India in the 11th ('entury A. 1). I have
written a short note on this..........) shall feel extremely obliged if
out of your extensive reading you could kindly tell me if you have
come across any other reference to Persian oil similar to this. The
Sloka in the Benares edition reads : ---
“ अचिन्तनीयं तुहिनद्रवाणां श्रीखंडवापी पयसामयाध्यम् ।
असूत्रयत्पत्रिपु पारसीकतैलाग्निमैतम्य कृते मनोभूः"
This verse is identical willi verse 20 of Canto IX of Bihler's
edition ( B. S. Series, 1875), p. 74. There is only one variant in
its second line, viz., “ qi Hai: ” for “ a garanz: "' but the refer-
ence to trattatia is not affected by this variant.”.
I was very much interested in Dr. Agrawala's scholarly in-
quiry and promised to note down any other reference to Persian
oil in sources early or late during the course of my cultural studies.
Recently I carried out a cursory perusal of the Sanskrit Buddhist
text called the dryamañuśrī- mülakalpa ( Ed. ly Ganapati Sastri in
Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, 1920). Fortunately on page 83 of
this edition I found a relcrence to JAC to be used for lamps as
an alternative to taga or ghee from cow's milk as the following
extract clearly shows :-
__ " ज्येष्ठं पटं तत्रैव देशे तस्मिस्थाने पटस्य महती पूजां कृत्वा सुवर्णरूप्यमयः
ताम्रमृत्तिकमया प्रदीपकैः तुरुकतैलपूर्णैः गव्यघतपूर्णर्वा प्रदीपकैः प्रत्यग्रवस्त्र-
खण्डाभिः कृतवर्तिभिः लक्षमेकं पटस्य प्रदीपानि निवेदयत् । सवाणि समंसमन्तात्

In this extract the worshipper is asked to carry out the worship of
pața ( a sacred piece of cloth). He is then to tear off the pața into
numerous shreds with a view to making these shreds into wicks for
a lac of lamps to be lighted. These lamps may be of gold, silver,
copper or earth. They should be filled either with turuska oil or
cow's ghee.
I am of opinion that the turuşka taila mentioned in the
above extract is possibly identical with pärasika taila mentioned by
Kashmirian poet Bilhaņa in his Vikramārikadeva-('arita composed
about A. D. 1085. In this connection I may point out that the
Kashmirian commentator of Suśruta, viz., Dallaņa, who flourished
about A. 1). 1100 has used the word turuşka desa in the sense of
Persia while explaining the term aśrabalā in Suśruta. According
to Dallana asvabalā is identical with “ Hispittha” known in
“ turuşka deśa”, i.e., Persia. In my paper' on aśvabalā I have point-
cd out that the word “ lispittha " is identical with the Persian word
“ Ispist” or “ Aspist.” In view of this evidence we can equate
the Parasika taila of Bilhana ( A. D. 1085 ) with the turuska taila of
Aryamañj uśrīmülakalpa which appears to be earlier than A. D. 900
as it was translated into Chinese between A. D. 980 and 1000 and
into Tibetan in the 11th century A. D. According to Marcelle
the work belongs to the 2nd century A. D.3 Even if such an early
date for this work is not accepted we can safely put this work ear-
lier than A. D. 900 and consequently the reference to turuşka taila
mentioned in it is more than 200 years earlier than that to l'ara-
siku taila made by Bilhana about A. D. 1085.
In view of the continuous contact of India with Persia from
early times it is easy to explain how some K'erosene oil or Rock-oil
from Persia got imported into India and was actually used for
lamps as vouched by the Sanskrit Buddhist text composed prior to
A. D). 900 and by Bilhana's poem of the 11th century A. D. I hope
Dr. V. S. Agrawala and other scholars interested in the history of
the Rock-oil will examine this question thoroughly and see how far
my suggestion about the identity of Turuska oil with Pārasika oil
is correct. For the present I am convinced that some rock-oil was
imported into North India between say A. D. 500 and 1100 and
was possibly used as lamp-oil, being free froin objections laid
down against the use of fats of animals by some of our texts on
Dharmaśāstra.

50. Date of Vangasena, the Author of the
Cikitsāsāra - samgraha — Before A. D. 1200 1
In a very informative article on the Vaidyaka Literature of
Bengal, published in the Indian Culture, Vol. III, No. 1, page 159,
Mr. Nalini Nath Das Gupta makes the following remarks about
Vangasena, the author of Akhyātavyâkarana and Cikitsasara-
Sangraha' :-
‘Although of uncertain date, Vangasena must not
be mistaken, as is sometimes done, as a recent writer,
for two of the Manuscripts of his Cikitsäsāra-Sangraha,
found in the Deccan, are dated in 1376 Samvat or
1319-20 A.D.? and he must, therefore, belong to the 13th
century at the latest '( italics ours ).
These remarks open the question of Vangasena's date and I am sure
Mr. Das Gupta will supply us with more data from Vangasena's
works bearing on his chronology during the course of his studies.
My object in writing this note is to record the data found by me, in
the light of which I am inclined to believe that Vangasena be-
longs not 'to 13th century at the latest' but to 12th century at the
latest.
Hemādri, the author of the Caturvarga-Cintamani, who wrote
his commentary on the Aşțāngahrdaya of Vāgbhata II during the
reign of King Rāmacandras of Devagiri ( 1271 to 1309 A.D.) men-

1. Vide Aufrecht : Cata. Catalogorum, I, 548 – where Vanga-
sena, the author of Akhyātavyākaraña and Vangasena, the author of
Cikitsāsāra-Samgraha are apparently distinguished. He is quoted
in Lauhapradipa ( W., p. 301 ) and by Bhāvamiśra ( Oxf. 311b). His
work on medicine is commented on by Vaidyanatha.

tions and quotes from Vangasena. Hemadri wrote his Caturvarga-
Cintāmaņi during the reign of King Mahādeva, the predecessor of
King Rāmacandra. The period of Mahādeva's reign is put between
A.D. 1200 and 1270 and Hemādri was a minister and keeper of
records under both these Devagiri Kings.'
I shall now record Hemādri's references to Vangasena in his
Ayurvedarasāyana :-
Nidana-Sthāna, Chap. 11, verse 33 - The commentary
(1)
reads--
“वङ्गसेने (ज्वराधिकारे श्लो० ४८४-५०४)

(2) Nidāna-Sthāna, Chap. V, verse 15 — commentary –
" वङ्गसने तु ( राजयक्ष्माधिकारे श्लो० ६)
'भक्तद्वषो ज्वरः श्वासः कासः शोणितदर्शनम् ।

(Continued from previous page)
" हेमाद्रि म रामस्य राज्ञः श्रीकरणेऽवधि ।

Hemādri's commentary has not been so far published but an edition

Some of the 49 references to Vangas ena by Hemādri and quota-
tions from his work are long extracts which show the nature and
extent of Hemādri's indebtedness to Vangasena. No complete
commentary of Hemādri has yet been available and in the N. S.

Press Edition referred to in this paper the commentary available is
only for ( 1 ) the Sūtrasthāna, ( 2 ) the first 6 chapters of the Nidāna-
sthāna, and ( 3 ) the first 7 chapters of the Cikitsitasthāna. The
references recorded by me in this paper are from this portion of the
commentary only. If the entire copy of the Ayurvedarasāyana is
recovered perhaps more references to Vangasena may he traced in
it. Out of the 49 references recorded above we have 3 from the
Nidānasthāna and 46 from the Cikistitasthāna and none from the
Sūtrasthāna, so far as my cursory perusal of the text goes.
This wholesale borrowing from Vāngasena's work proves in the
first instance the popularity in the Deccan of Vangasena, a Bengali
writer according to Mr. Das Gupta, and secondly, it detracts much
of the originality of Hemādri's commentary. This is but natural in
the case of Hemādri, who had perhaps developed a habit for the
compilation of texts from his predecessors' works after having com-
piled his magnum opus viz. the Caturvarga-Cintāmaņi. In spite of
his towering intellect the literary works undertaken by him were
too enormous in extent and scope for a busy minister of the state
for the sustained display of originality and critical acumen in the
entire field of his activity. To sum up: From the nature and
extent of Hemādri's references to and quotations from Vangasena's
work, I am inclined to conclude that l'argasena flourished in the
12th century at the latest. At any rate he is earlier than A. D. 1200
as we must presume a difference of about 75 years between him and
Hemādri (1260 A.D.).

51. Date of Vyavahāranirņaya of Varadarāja
– Between 1100 and 1350 A. D. I
Rao Bahadur K. V. Rangaswamy Aiyangar in his Preliminary
Note' to the Edition of the V'yavahāranirnaya? of Varadarāja
which is being published by instalments in the Brahma-Vidyā
states that this digest of Hindu Law is “usually named third among
the four digests ( Nibandha) recognized by the Courts as forming
the special authorities of the South Indian 'school' of Hindu
Law.” In view of the importance of this work for administrative
purposes it has engaged the attention of South Indian scholars and
of historians of the Dharmaśāstra and evidence has been gathered
by them with a view to fixing the limits of the date to which the
work can be assigned. Rao Bahadur Aiyangar in his elaborate Preli-
minary Note to the Adyar edition of the Varadarājiya records the
following dated references to this work :-
A. D. 1515 --- Sarasvativilāsa quotes from the Varadarājiya.
, , 1612 – Nirnayasindhu quotes from the Varadarājiya
C., , 1600 — Smrtimuktāphala also quotes from the Varada-
rājīya.
On the strength of these references Rao Bahadur Aiyangar
arrives at the following conclusion with regard to the date of the
Vyavahāranirnaya alias Varadarājiya.“
I Mimāriisa Prakāśa ( Pooria ), Vol. III, pp. 15--18.

DATE OF VYAVAHĀRANIRŅAYA

“ It is not easy to determine the date of the Vyavahāranir-
ņaya. It is cited by the Sarasvatīvilāsa and so far no quotation
from it or reference to it in any work of earlier date has been traced.
But it quotes no writer later than Vijñāneśvara, the author of the
Mitākṣarā.” Rao Bahadur Aiyangar further mentions Prof. P. V.
Kane's view about the date of the Varadarājīya as follows :-
"Mr. P. V. Kane would place Varadarāja, the author of the
V yavahāranirnaya between A. D. 1450 and 1500. His grounds
are these. It is not referred to in the Mādhavīyam and the Smrti-
candrikā which are South Indian digests ; and it must, therefore,
have been composed after these works.”
Rao Bahadur Aiyangar does not view with favour the argument
of silence adopted by Prof. Kane but hopes that “ within the
limits furnished by the citation of Vijñāneśvara by Varadarāja and
of the V yavahāranirņaya by Pratāparudra? in the Sarasvatīvilāsa
(i. e. 1100 to 1500 ), a close approximation may perhaps be
reached from an examination of the opinions and the substance of
the work itself and the discovery of its relations to other works.”
The above view-point adopted by Rao Bahadur Aiyangar ap-
pears to me to be the correct one especially in matters of chro-
nology, which is the back-bone of history. .
As however, Rao Bahadur Aiyangar has not given us any closer
approximation to Varadarāja's date within the limits of A. D.
1160 to 1500, I propose to do so in this paper on the strength of evi-
dence not hitherto recorded by any Indian or European scholar,'

who has dealt with the problem so far Kātayavema,' the com-
mentator of the three dramas of Kālidāsa was the minister of
Kumāragiri, king of Kondavidu. Though Kātayavema often
speaks of Kumāragiri as his patron he was in fact the brother-in-law
of Kumāragiri, being the husband of Mallāmbīkā, daughter of Pota
Reddy.? “Kātayavema was a powerful personality and Kumāragiri
being aware of his power appointed him as minister and gave him
Rajahmundry portion for the help rendered by him in establishing
peace and order in his kingdom.” 3
It is natural that a minister and literateur of Kāțayavema's
reputation should study and quote:from a work like the Varadarājīya
which had attained some reputation as a work on Vyavahāra in his

repeated such unverified statement." ( J. D. Mayne -- Flindu Law and
Usage, 1922, p. 28 ; J. Jolly Hindu Law and Custom, 1928, p. 86 ;
West and Buhler - Digest of Hindu Law, 1919, p. 51.). The above
references have been recorded here from Rao Rahadur Aivangar's
Preliminary Note for the guidance of those who want to go into the
question of Varadarāja's date in detail.

bhupati, son of Kāțayabhūpati hy his wife Doddamba, who was the
daughter of Vemabhūpati. The commentary was named after the
author's wife's brother, Kumāragirirāja, who was the son of Anna-
pota, son of the above-said Vemabhūpati and under whom the author
served as a minister. This king is called Vasantarāja and ruled over
Kumāragiri. He is said to have conquered a number of hill-forts
whose names are given in a stanza in the extracts. The author be-
longs to the Reddi caste ( Sudra ) and appears to have lived about the
close of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century. The stanzas
giving the author's genealogy given in the extracts below do not seem
to be contained in the MSS described in the India Office Library
Catalogue and the Tanjore Palace Library Catalogue.”

time. Accordingly we find him in his commentary' on the Vikra-
morvašīya mentioning this work and quoting from it as follows:
" तथा च उक्तम् वरदराजीये राजधर्मेषु -
'दिवसस्याष्टमं भागं मुक्त्वा भागत्रयं च यत् ।

could be ident is now saradarā.
If the above passage could be identified in the text of the
Vyavahāranirņaya ( or Varadarājiya) that is now extant we can
definitely say that Kāțayavema is quoting from the Varadarājīya, the
importance of which has been pointed out by Rao Bahadur Ranga-
swamy Aiyangar and which he is editing by instalments in the
Brahmavidyā journal. Luckily for us the passage quoted by
Kāțayavema can be found on p. 4 of the portion of the text publish-
ed in the Brahmavidyā Journal ( issue for October 1937) and reads
as follows :--
( व्यवहारपरिकरकाण्डम् )
" दिवसस्याष्टमं भागं मुक्त्वा कालत्रयं तु यत्

commentary by Prof. Chārudeva Shastri, Lahore, 1929. Besides
his commentaries on the three dramas of Kālidāsa Kāțayavema
commented on the Amaruśataka. A Ms of this commentary is
available in the D. A. V. College Library, Lahore. On p. 5
of the edition of the commentary of Kāțayavema on Vikramo-
rvasiya we find Kāțayavema referring to his commentary
on the Sakuntala "उक्तं शाकुन्तलव्याख्याने।". Katayavema dedicates
his commentary to his patron Kumāragiri by calling it “ Vasanta-
rājiya.” Vasantarāja was the popular name of Kumāragiri on
account of his love for Vasanta festivals. A merchant by name
Avachi Tippaya Setti had the monopoly of supplying all the articles
necessary for the Vasanta festivals of Kumāragiri ( Vide p. 57 of
Sources of Vijayanagara History, 1919, by S. K. Aiyangar ).

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
... The foregoing extract together with its variants shows the
identity of Kāțayavema's quotation with the passage as found in the
extant text of the Varadarājiyam and hence the date of Kātayàvema
gives us a definite limit to the date of the Varadarājiyam, the
subject of this paper.
Now the date of Kātayavema has already been fixed by
scholars because it is dependent on and associated with the date of
his patron King Kumāragiri alias Vasantarāja. The Reddi King
Ana Pota died in A. D. 1366 and his son Kumāragiri, being a minor,
the kingdom passed to Ana Vema, who was also known as Dharma
Vema. Anavema reigned till 1383 and was succeeded by Kumāra-
giri, who reigned for a short period. Kumāragiri was a contem-
porary of Harihararāya of Vizianagar dynasty. Of the three Hari-
hararāyas, Harihara II, who ruled from 1377-1404 A. D., seems to be
the contemporary of Kumāragiri. Pandit Prabhakar Sastri assigns
Kumāragiri a period of nearly nine years from 1391-1400 A. D.
while the late Rao Bahadur K Veeresalingam Pantulu states in his
Lives of Poets (Vol. I-revised 1917, p 430 ) that Kumāragiri reign-
ed from 1383 to 1400. Dr. N. Venkatarao from whose article we
have taken the foregoing information states that Kumāragiri lived
between 13,5 and 1400 and that he reigned for a period of 7 years.
As Kumāragiri's date is confined to the last quarter of the 14th
century and as Kāțayavema was his minister, we can safely say that
Kāțayavema flourished about 1385 A. D. We have also seen that
Kāțayavema has quoted from the Vyavahāra nirnaya and mentioned
it by its popular title Varadarājīya. This quotation has further been
identified by us in the extant text of the Varadarājīya, thus proving
the genuineness of the quotation. It would, therefore, be reasonable
to conclude that the Varadarājīya had become an authoritative work
in Kāțyavema's timeli. e. 1385 A. D.). If this position is accept-
ed we can definitely fix A.D. 1350 as a new later limit for the date
of Varadarājiya, the earlier limit being A. D. 1100 as fixed by Rao
Bahadur Aiyangar on the strength of the reference to Mitākṣarā in
the Varadarājīya. It will thus be seen that the present paper
pushes back the date of the Varadarājīya from A. D. 1500 to about
1350 A. D. a period of about 150 years. The new limits for this
date, would, therefore, be 1 100 to 1350 A. D. and not 1100 to 1500
as fixed by Rao Bahadur Aiyangar.
In view of Kātayavema's reference to the Varadarājīya the view
of Prof. P. V. Kane about the date of the Varadarājiya becomes
untenable. According to this view as stated by Rao Bahadur
Aiyangar, Pro. P. V. Kane would place Varadarāja between 1450 and

Page 378****************************************************************************************
DATE OF VYAVAHARANIRŅAYA
339
1500 A. D. for the reason that Varadaraja is not referred to in the
Madhaviya and Smſticandrikā. Rao Bahadur Aiyangar has already
expressed his suspicion about the argument of silence on which
Prof. Kane has based his view. The present paper not only fully
justifies this attitude of Rao Bahadur Aiyangar but also establishes
new limits for the date of Varadarāja viz. A. D. 1100-1350.
In the present paper I have relied for the date of Kāțayavema
on the studies of other scholars. It would, however, be useful to
conclude this paper by recording some epigraphic references to
Kātayavema in support of the dates assigned to him already.
The inscriptional references to Kāțayavema and his family as
recorded by Mr. Rangacharya in his Inscriptions of the Madras
Presidency' are as follows :---
(1) A grant of Kātayavema of Rajahmundry dated Saka 1333
(= A. D. 1411 ) Khara, Kārttika Paurņami. This grant was made
by Katayavema, the minister of Kumāragiri of Kondavidu who
received from his master the eastern country of Rajahmundry for
his distinguished services. The genealogies of both Kuināragiri
and Kāțayavema are given and the inscription is thus of great value
in connecting the two Reddi lines. The object of the grant was
the village of Mallāvaram ( named after his wife Mallāmbikā, who
was sister of Kumāragiri ). (The genealogies are the same as in
Kāțayavema's commentary on the Sākuntala called Kumāragirirā-
jiyam ) See Ep. Ind. Vol. IV, pp. 318-27 where Mr. Ramayya
Pantulu edits the inscription.
(2) Records dated Saka 1332 ( = A. D. 1410 ) containing the
gift of a village by Kātama-Reddi Vema Reddi.
The names of the wives of Kāțama Reddi viz. Tallasānam-
mangāru and Mallasānammangāru are registered. The record says
that Kātama had also a son named Kumāragiri, who is called a
reincarnation of the earlier Kumāragiri.
(3) A record dated Śaka 1308 ( = A. D. 1386 ) containing a gift
of gold by the Reddi King Kāțamareddi Vemireddi for providing
1. A Topographical List of the Inscriptions of the Madras
Presidency by V. Rangacharya in 3 vols.

(4! A record of the time of Reddi King Virabhadra ( of the
Rajahmundry branch ) by the King who was the son of Allāda,
son-in-law of Kātaya-Vema and husband of Anitalli.
The foregoing epigraphic references to Kāțayavema ranging
from A. D. 1386 to A. D. 1411, covering a period of his life in which
he attained some power and celebrity, leave no doubt about his date
arrived at by other scholars and referred to by me already in this
paper. In view of these epigraphic references the later limit of
A. D. 1350 fixed by me for the date of the Varadarājīya, which is
quoted by Kātayavema, stands amply confirmed.

while eigu quoted on folio 4 is the author of the lexicon
PERHET composed about 950 A. D.'
I have pointed out elesewhere? that Arjunavarmadeva,
whose dates are A. D. 1211 - 1215, quotes the following stanza from
the Arya-Saptašati in his commentary on the Amarušataka ( Vide
Page 12 of Kāvyamālā No. 18 (Amaruśataka )]:-
“ ugat Tawaranto
अन्यमुखे दुर्वादो यः प्रियवदने स एव परिहासः ।
इतरेन्धनजन्मा यो धूमः सोऽगुरुसमुद्भवो धूपः ॥"
As Govardhanācārya was a contemporary of Jayadeva, the
author of the Gitagovinda, who was a court-poet at the court of
King Lakşmanasena of Bengal ( A. D. 1185-1206 ) Arjunavarmadeva
was practically a junior contemporary of Govardhanācārya. Conse-
quently the two contemporaries may be said to belong to the
period A. D. 1150-1220. Arjunavarmadeva quotes the above verse
of Govardhanācārya in his comment on stanza 8 of the Amarušataka.
This very verse is quoted by CM in his Ehātacintāmaņi on this
stanza. CM, however, does not mention Govardhanācārya.
He merely quotes the verse as follows on folio 5 of MS No. 321
of 1884-87 :-
"* i Tych........ nyendiya gfa ”
It appears from the above quotation that CM had before him
Arjunavarmadeva's commentary on the Amarušataka.
The foregoing evidence may warrant an inference that CM
composed his commentary Bhavacintamani after C. A.D. 1250. The
later limit to the date of this commentary is furnished by the date
Samvat 1726 ( = A. D. 1670 ) of a MS of this commentary at the

B. O. R. Institute viz. No. 365 of 1887-91. This MS also con-
tains the stanza from the Aryāsaptašati referred to above. It
occurs on folio 6 of this MS. We are thus in a position to fix the
limits for the date of the commentary of CM between about A. D.
1250 and 1600.
Kampilya mentioned by CM as his native place is possibly
identical with Kampil 28 miles north-east of Fattegad in the Farra-
khabad district of the United Provinces. It is situated on the old
Ganges' between Budaon and Farrakhabad as stated by Nandolal
Dey (p. 88 of Geogr. Dictionary, 1927).
There is a town in the Hospet taluk of the Bellary District cal-
led Kämpli on the bank of Tungabhadrā river. I cannot say if this
town has any connection with witamy, the native place of Catur-
bhuja Miśra.
The editor of the Amaruśataka mentions five commentators'
of this poem but this number does not contain the name of CM,
the author of the Bhāvacintāmani.
It remains to be seen if any con mentators of the Amaruśataka,
posterior to CM, refer to him in their commentaries.

not do any justice to this rare poem by a Hindu court-poet
of the celebrated Sultan Begaļā, I propose to analyse the only
MS of it acquired by Bühler with a view to making its contents
accessible to the students of the history of Gujarat in general and
of the Sultans of Gujarat in particular.

jarabakshapātaśāhi — Sri Mahamuda-Suratrana Caritra
"The Life of Sultan Mahmud” ( Begadhā of Ahmedabad )
by Udayarāja is quite a literary curiosity. The author who
declares himself to be the son of Prayāgadāsa and the pupil
of Rāmadāsa celebrates Mahmud popularly reported to have
been the most violent persecutor of Hindus and Hinduism as
if he were an orthodox Hindu King. He calls him the crest
jewel of the royal race ( Rajanya Cüļāmani) as if he were a
Ksatriya and he asserts that Sri and Sarasvati attend on his
footsteps, that he surpasses Karņa in liberality, and that his
ancestor Muzaffar Khan assisted Kyspa against Kali. The
Carita is divided into seven sargas. The first ( Slokas 29 )
entitled "Surendra's and Sarasvati's Colloquy" (Surendra-
Sarasvati-Samvada) is introductory and relates how Brahma

The MS of the Rājāvinoda (No. 18 of 1874-75) consists of
28 folios ( each folio being 10 inches x 43 inches in size and each
page containing 8 lines, with about 31 letters to a line). It
begins as follows:-

of Mahmud Shah and how she sang the praises of Mahmud,
The second ( vamśānukirtana – ślokas 31 ) gives the genea-
logy of Mahmud beginning with Muzaffar Khan. The state-
ments made appear to be historically correct. The third
( sabhāsamāgama - ślokas 33 ) describes Mahmud's entry into
the Darbar hall. The fourth ( sarvāvasara - blokas 33 ) relates
what princes and people were received in the Darbar. The
fifth ( samgita ranga-prasanga -- ślokas 35 ) describes a Nách
given by the Sultan. The sixth ( Vijayayātrotsava -- ślokas
36) and the Seventh (Vijayalaksmilabha - Slokas 37) are
devoted to a rhapsodic description of Mahmud's warlike
exploits. The frequent allusions to the Padishah's liberality
make it probable that the author either had received or hop-
ed to receive Dakşiņā from him."

The above verse giving the genealogy of the Sultans of
Gujarat in four lines is found recorded before the Colophons of
each of the 7 sargas of this poem. I shall now compare this genea-
logy with the genealogy recorded in the Dohad Stone Inscription
of Mahamūd ( Begadā), dated V. S. 1515, Saka 1410 ( = A. D.
1488), recently edited by Dr. H. D. Sankalia.'
Rājavinoda
( Between A. D. 1458-1511 A. D.)
Dohad Inscription
___A. D. 1488
(1) शाहि मुदाफर
(2) महंमद, son of No. 1 (तत्पुत्रः)
(1) साहि मुदप्फर ( A. D. 1392 -
1410 )
(2) साहि महंमद, son of No. 1
(तस्मात् समभवत् )
(3) साहि अहमदः ( A. D. 1411 -
___1442 ) after him ( ततः)
(4) साहि महंमद, son of No. 3
( अस्य तनुजः जातः)-( A. D.
1442--1451)
(5) महमन्साहि, son of No. 4
(तदायात्मजः ) - ( A. D.
1458-1511)
( 3 ) अहंमद, in his family ( तस्या-
न्वये प्रसूतः)
(4) साह महम्मद, son of No. 3
। (तस्मादभूत् )
(5) साह महमूद in his family
( अन्वये जातः)
It would be seen from the above comparison that the two
genealogies agree so far as four generations are concerned. There
appears to be some disagreement with regard to HH (Begadā)
who is described as a Tract: with reference to his predecessor
HEHE in the Rajavinoda while in the Dohad Inscription we are told
that महमूद ( Begada ) was born in his family (जातः अन्वये), i.e., of
साह महम्मद, his predecessor. Students interested in this genea-
logy may examine both these genealogies more closely and see how

far they could be reconciled with the genealogy of these Sultans
given by the Muslim historians.'
In the Dohad inscription (verse 7 ) the title ग्यास (दीन) ap-
pears to have been applied to #AT ( Begaņā ), but this impression
cannot be supported by the text of the verse in its proper
grammatical sequence according to which the two lines could be
read in prose order as follows :-" श्रीग्यास (दीन) प्रभोः अन्वये साह
श्रीमहमदवीरनृपतिः (विख्यातः उदारचरितः वीर्यवान् )जातः. " Similarly
the prose order of the last 2 lines of verse 29 of Canto I of the
Rajavinoda would read as follows :-
“ अस्य (= अहंमदस्य ) तनुजः साहिमहंन्दः जातः, गायासदीनाल्यया
ख्यातः, तदीयात्मजः श्री महमूदसाहिनृपतिर्जीयात्"
According to this prose order the epithet गायासदीन ( = The
Aid of the Faith) becomes applicable to महंमद and not to महमूद
( Begada ). The following verse of the Rājavinoda further sup-
ports my interpretation :--
Foliio 6a - " आनंदनः सुमनसामथ नंदनोऽभू-
भाग्यश्रियां निधिरहंमदपातसाहेः ।
गायासीन इति साहिमहंमदेन्द्रः
क्षोणीभुजां मुकुटपृष्टपदारविंदः ॥ १४ ॥"
In this verse साहि महंमद is called गायासदीन in a clear manner.
Again on folio 6, verse 20 clearly states that महमूद ( Begada) was
the son of महमद :-
" तस्यात्मजः किल महमदपातसाहेः । श्रीमानयं विजयते महमूदसाहिः etc."

ed in the Rajavinoda to enable scholars to study the historical

I leave it to the experts in the field of the mediaeval history of
Gujarat to identify the author of the present poem in contemporary
records, Hindu or Muslim. Udayarāja appears to have been a
court-poet of Mahamūd Begada in view of this mahākāvya in praise
of his patron in a rather lavish manner. It is remarkable that
Sultan Mahamud Begadā of notorious bigotrys should patornize
Hindu pandits like Udayarāja. The Rajavinoda poem must have
been composed when Mahamūd was in the hey-day of his political
glory. Two broad limits for the date of this poem are A. D. 1458
and 1511 which cover up the entire period of 53 years of Mahamūd's
reign. We must now try to narrow down these chronological limits
on the strength of the dates of known conquests and exploits of
Mahamūd. The territory of Malwa being on the borders of
Gujarat, there are numerous references to it in the present poem.
It would be useful for purposes of chronology if these references
are examined as they are likely to yield useful chronological data
for narrowing down the limits for the date of the Rājavinoda viz.
A. D. 1458 and 1511.
The pitiful condition to which the King of Mālava was reduced
1. The title thate for the present poem is similar to the title
THRITE composed by TTH for Rāmadāsa, a former minister of Emperor
Akbar in A.D. 1613-14 (vide p. 159 of Bibliography of Mughal India
( 1526-1707 A.D. ) by Professor Sri Ram Sharma, K. P. House,
Bombay, 1939).
2. Ibid. p. 95 — A writer of the name Udairāj is mentioned as a
contributor to the collection of letters known as Mujmu 'ai-
Munshiyāt ( MS in State Library, Rampur ). He appears to be a later
writer.
3. Mahamūd forced his tributary and obedient Chief Mandalak
of Girnår to embrace Islam (vide Humayūn Badshāh by Dr. S. K.
Banerji, 1938, p. 112, and Cambridge History of India, Vol. III, p. 305 ).

26-21):-
" त्यक्त्वा लुंठितदेशकोशविषयो दाग्दुर्घमानग्रहं
राजन् जीवितमात्रलाभमधुना कांक्षस्यसौ मालवः ।। २९ ॥"
Has this verse any reference to the military help given by
Mahamūd against Mahamūd Khilji of Malwa in A. D. 1462 and
1463 when the latter attacked Nizam Shah, the King of the Deccan ?
Verses 10 and 11 of Canto IV (folio 13 ) refer to दक्षिणनप as also
मालवमंडश :--
"वेषं विशेषरुचिरं दधतादरेण

The above verses describe the status of the दक्षिणनप' and
मालवमंडलेश at the court of Mahamuda Begada. These verses form
part of Canto IV which describes the princes and people received
in Mahamud's Darbar.
("राज्ञोऽस्य धरदत्तपदावकाशान्देशाधिपान्सदसि पश्य कृतप्रवेशान्" - IV, 1)

1, Cf. दक्षिणदिक्पति in verse 8 of Dohad Inscription. Dr. Sankalia
suggests that this reference to “ Lord of the South” refers to the
help Mahamūd gave to Nizam Shah of the Deccan against Mahamud
Khilji of Malwa in A.D. 1462 and 1463. (Epi. Indica Jan. 1938, p.
216). In verse 10 of Sarga IV of the Rājavinoda दक्षिणनृप is called
विचक्षण i. e. far-seeing or circumspect in his conversation with
Mahamid, while in verse 11 of the same Sarga मालवमंडलेश is represent-
ed in an attitude of complete surrender after being defeated by
Mahamūd's valour. I am inclined to equate array of our poem with
दक्षि गदिक्पति of Dohad inscription (verse 8). Another reference to
दक्षिणनृप in the Rajavinoda is found in VII, 26 :-" न दक्षिणनृपः भ( व ?)
ति मेदपाठे मुदं । न विंदति न माद्यति स्वहृदये स दिल्लीपते: etc."

In II, 11, we have the following reference to अहमद's invasion
of Malwa :-
Folio 5 -- "हुशंगसाहेरधिवासदुर्गमाकामता मंडपमाग्रहेण ।
येनोचकैराचकृषे करेण पदे पदे मालवमंडलश्रीः॥११॥"
Hushang Shah of Malwa invaded Gujarat in A. D. 1411 and
1418 but was repulsed by अहंमद. In A. D. 1419 अहमद invaded
Malwa and defeated Hushang Shāh who took refuge in the fort of
Mandu. अहंमद invaded Malwa second time in A. D. 1422 but did
not succeed in capturing Mandu.
Sarga IV, verse 12 refers to Rāņā Kumbha of Mewar as
follows:
Folio 13 - " यः पार्थिवः पृथुतरः खलु कुंभकर्णः

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Line 3 of the above stanza clearly tells us that Kumbhakarna is
serving Mahamūda ( Begada ) as a vassal. Evidently Rāṇā Kum-
bha must have been living when the Rajavinoda was composed.
Let us, therefore, consider the chronology of Rāṇā Kumbha's reign
in Mewar. The then King of Mewar or agar is styled as $79 by
our author in the expression “AISTEOITTT: "(folio 26 ) and
this statement agrees with the reference to King Kumbhakarņa in
verse 12 quoted above.
Rāṇā Kumbha came to the throne in A. D. 1433.' He was
murdered by his son Udayakarņa in Vikrama Samvat 1525, i.e.,
1469 A. D. As Rāṇā Kumbhakarna is introduced into the Darbar
of Mahamud, we must treat this mention of Kumbhakarņa as a
contemporary reference to this King prior to his death in A. D.
1469. If this position is accepted, we must fix the date of the
Rajavinoda between A. D. 1458, the year when Mahmud came to
the throne, and A. D. 1469, the year of Rāṇā Kumbhakarņa's death.
If my date for Rajavinoda viz." Between A.D. 1568 and 1469"
is accepted, it would be easy to account for the absence of
references in this poem to many of the exploits of Mahamūd
Begadā which are found referred to in the Dohad Inscription of
A. D. 1488, written about 2 decades after our present poem and
which could be taken to refer to events between A. D. 1458 and
1488, a period of 30 years.
At this stage of the discussion of the date and contents of
the Rajavinoda, I am inclined to suggest a hypothesis about
the probable identity of authorship for both the Sanskrit historical
poem and the Dohad Sanskrit inscription in verse. The points
of identity with regard to these two compositions may be noted
below for comparison in parallel columns :-
1. See History of Rajputana, Vol. I (by J. S. Gahlot), Jodhpur,
1937, p. 207, where a portrait of Rāņā Kumbha is reproduced from the
original in London Museum. Duff's Indian Chronology, p. 265, states
that Rājamalla, the Son of Kumbhakarņa succeeded his father in A.D.
1474. Mr. Gahlot gives Samvat 1525–1530 as the period of Udaya.
karna's reign, Rajamalla succeeding Udayakarņa in A.D. 1473( Samvat
1530 ).

exploits of Mahamūda's
four predecessors in Sarga

author of the Rajavinoda
states that the poem was

Mahamūda :(“ TAITEIT

poem was meant as an in-
troduction with a view to
getting into Mahamūda's
favour.
This genealogy differs
from that given in Muslim
sources as pointed out by
Dr. Sankalia ( Epi. Indica

Mahamuda's reign from
A. D. 1458 to A. D. 1488,
the date of the Inscription.

Inscription is similar in

appears to be the work of
the author of the Rājavi-
noda after he had enjoyed
continuous patronage of
Mahamuda between the
date of composition of
Rajavinoda and A. D.

records places and persons

of मुदफ्फर, the Rajavinoda,

पलिवन :-
(folio 5):-
" अद्याप्यहो नंदपदाधिनाथा-

The rulers of CT are des-
cribed by the adjective
" विभिन्नप्राकारसौधस्फुरद ( दे )ह

bodies shining by the white
dust from the broken

sion विभिन्नप्राकार shows that
there existed a fort at नंदपद
in the midst of पल्लिवन,
This is an earlier reference
to पल्लिवन in the time of
मुदफ्फर's son महंमद.
(13) The Rajavinoda refers to
the title गायासदीन (folios

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Rajavinoda of Udayarāja
Dohad Stone Inscription
921:” is an epithet of
H6A7, the father of Begadā,
according to my view.
My view does not conflict
with the title given to
Begadā in coins and in-
scriptions, viz., “Nasīr-
ud-duniya Wa-ud-din (=
Defender of the Faith and
the World ). My view
also agrees with the
epithet “ Ghiyās-ud-din”
applied to Muhammad II
( son of Ahmad I) in his
coin legends. (Vide p.
216 of Epi. Indica, Jan.
1938).
The foregoing discussion based on a cursory study of the
Rajavinoda and the Dohad Inscription, edited by Dr. Sankalia leads
us to arrive at the following conclusions tentatively for the consi-
deration of veteran scholars of the history of Gujarat :-
(1) Udayarāja, the son of Prayāgadāsa, was a Hindu court
-- poet of Mahamūda Begadā ( 1438 to 1511 A. D.).
(2) Udayarāja composed this Sanskrit Mahā-Kavya in
7 Cantos dealing with the life of Begadā and his an-
cestors to please the great Sultan in the first decade of
the Sultan's reign between A. D. 1458 and 1469 according
to my evidence.
(3) This same court-poet Udayarāja continued to receive
the patronage from Begaļā during the next two decades
of the Sultan's reign and he took great interest in the
genealogy and exploits of Begadā during the period of
this patronage.
(4) From the brief comparison of points of identity and
contact between Udayarāja's work (the Rajavinoda )
and the Dohad Stone Inscription of A. D. 1488, an

impression is gathered that the Inscription is a brief but
revised and up-to-date abstract in verse of the author's
juvenile poem.
I would consider my labour in the preparation of this paper
amply repaid if Dr. Sankalia or any other scholars interested in
the mediaeval history of Gujarat edit this historical kāvya' of
Udayarāja on the basis of the only MS discovered by Dr. Bühler
and fully discuss all the historical implications of this rare con-
temporary prabandha composed by Sarasvati as the author puts it.

know that रत्नेश्वर wrote his commentary on the सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण at the

DATE OF JAGADDHARA
369
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in his edition of the Mālatīmadhava
(1875) with Jagaddhara's commentary gives us two sure limits for
the date of Jagaddhara, viz., (1) A.D. 1111, the date of Visva or
Visvaprakāśa lexicon quoted by Jagaddhara and (2) a dated MS of
Jagaddhara's commentary on the Mālatīmādhava bearing the date
A.D. 1708 and between these two points he tries to fix the following
chronological series :---
(A.D. 1111) विश्व-→ मल्लिनाथ-→ मेदिनीकर-→ जगद्धर -- MS of
मालतीमाधवटीका by जगद्धर ( A.D. 1708).
I now find another dated MS' of Jagaddhara's commentary on
the Mälatīmādhava bearing the date Samvat 1721 = A.D. 1665. We
have, therefore, to fix Jagaddhara's date between A.D. 1111 and
A.D. 1665.
We have seen above that Rāghavabhatta (A.D. 1475-1500)
quotes from a work called the trafTet which is presumably
identical with the संगीतसर्वस्व of Jagaddhara represented by the
Nepal MS. If this identity is correct, we are in a position to take

राघव भट्ट who also quotes from जगद्धर' संगीतसर्वस्व. If the work संगीतसर्वस्व

we may fix A. D., 1450 or so as one terminus to the date of this com-
mentator of the मालतीमाधव.

back the date of Jagaddhara from A.D. 1665' to A.D. 1450 or 80.
We have now to see if we can push back this date earlier than A.D.
1450.
Jagaddhara appears to have composed a work called i FT
as in his commentary on the Sarasvati-Kanțhābharaṇa, he quotes
from it as follows :-
Page 429 ( Kavyamālā, 94, 1934)-
"agai Agfanath-

Dr. S. K. De mentions a work on poetics called t he
(cited by Nārāyana on Gitagovinda, V.2).
Rāṇā Kumbha of Mewar ( A.D. 1428_1459 ) in his commentary
रसिकप्रिया on the Gitagovinda quotes from a work called रसिकसर्वस्व.'
If this रसिकसर्वस्व is identical with the रसिकसर्वस्व mentioned by
Jagaddhara as his own work, we may be in a position to take back
the date of Jagaddhara from A.D. 1450 to A.D. 1400 or so, if not
earlier. Unfortunately, however, no MS of Jagaddhara's the
get or of any other work of that name has been so far discovered,
and we are unable to verify this point any further.
Fixing A.D. 1400 as one probable limit for Jagaddhara's date,
let us sce if we can advance forward from the limit “A.D. 1111 "
for this date fixed by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar. It is proposed to
bring this limit forward from A.D. 1111 to about A.D. 1250 so that
Jagaddhara's date may be tentatively fixed between A.D. 1250 and
1400.

DATE OF JAGADDHARA

Jagaddhara in his commentary on the Malatīmadhava ( v. 2 at the
beginning of the commentary ) states that in composing the present
commentary he has made use of a previous commentary (“spaloia
žiai”). As the name of the commentator is not mentioned in this
statement, it is difficult to say what earlier commentary was used
by him in the preparation of his own commentary. Fortunately for
us we are now in a position to prove what commentary' was used by
Jagaddbara. This commentary is no other than Harihara's commen-
tary on the Mälatīmādhava represented by a single MS in the Library
of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, which has been described by the late
M. M. Hara Prasad Shastri.? The date of the MS is recorded in the
catalogue as A.D. 1216 but this appears to be the date of composi-
tion. At any rate the date of Harihara must lie between A.D. 1150
and 1216 as Harihara quotes from Mammata (A. D. 1100).”

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
As Jagaddhara has borrowed freely and at times verbatim from Hari-
hara's commentary we may safely say that Jagaddhara flourished defi-
nitely after A. D. 1250. In view of this new evidence ( not known
to Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in 1876 ) our limits would be as follows :-
(1) Sure limits ::- A. D. 1250 and 1650 -- 400 years.
(2) Probable limits : - A. D. 1250 and 1450 -- 200 years.
(3) Tentative limits :--- A. D. 1300 and 1400 - 100 years.
These tentative limits may now be discussed in the light of
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar's evidence of a tentative nature bearing on
the date of Jagaddhara. This evidence consists of two items :-
(1) Priority of Mallinātha to Jagaddhara.'
and
(Continued from previous page )
Mammața is not mentioned by name, the following quotation from the
Kāvyaprakāśa given by Harihara is too well known to need any argu-
ment re. its authorship :-
,"TIE :-- 151 aasta Errae feratura
91: qfaqat fra DRTITET TË II"
1. Vide p. xix of Preface to Mālatīmādhava ( B. S. S. Edition):
“ At the beginning of the Seventh Act (p. 286) after explaining that
the root 4373 with IT signifies “to take one's leave finally” or “to bid
adieu”, he ( Jagaddhara ) tells us that the same root occurs in the
Maghadüta and is explained by the commentator in the same way"
( " आपृच्छिः संवादार्थ इति शाब्दिकाः । अत एवापृच्छस्व प्रियसखममुमिति मेघदूतादौ
Erigar aga faqafhía 319:29HI")..... And since Jagaddhara speaks of
one commentator only without giving his name he must be understood
to have been aware of one commentary only so well-known to render
a mention of the author's name superfluous. I, therefore, take it that
he alludes to Mallinātha, who in his scholia on the poem does explain
the root in the same way as Jagaddhara. Mallinātha, therefore, lived
before our scholiast” ...“ Another circumstance which indicates Mal-
linātha's priority to Jagaddhara is that while the latter quotes from
Medini every now and then, the lexicon is never referred to by
Mallinātha. If the Medini were composed before Mallinātha, we
might certainly expect quotations from it somewhere in his vast com-
mentaries. Medinikara, therefore, very probably lived after Mal-
linātha and certainly before Jagaddhara.

Page 412****************************************************************************************
DATE OF JAGADDHARA
373
(2) Date of the lexicon of Medinikara, mentioned and
quoted by Jagaddhara in his comentaries.
The agrument advanced by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in support
of his supposed priority of Mallinātha to Jagaddhara is not at all
convincing. He argues that the root 341gey is explained in the
sense of “bidding adieu ” ( Hargra ) by Jagaddhara, and in doing
so he refers to a commentator on the Meghadūta as explaining this
root in this sense while explaining the verse “आपृच्छस्व प्रियसखममुं,"
and as Mallinätha's comment on this verse explains this root in the
sense alluded to by Jagadd hara, Sir R. G. Bhandarkar establishes
the identity of this commentator with Mallinātha, though Jagad-
dhara nowhere mentions Mallinātha in his commentary. This line
of argument can be refuted if we are able to find the explanation
of the root 31gear in the sense under reference ( farart) in any
other commentary on the Meghadūta preferably prior in date to
Jagaddhara. Though I have not looked into all the commentaries
on the Meghadūta, I have to point out that in the commentary of
Cāritravardhana who flourished between A. D. 1191 and A. D.
1385' the root 37192 is explained in the way referred to by Jagad-
dhara, (i.e., hargre), as will be seen from the following extract
from folio 10 of MS No. 345 of 1895-98 in the Govt. MSS Library
(B. O. R. Institute ) :-
"आपृच्छस्व निजप्रस्थानाय संवादाय पृच्छत्तीप्सायामे-
तस्माल्लोटमध्यमैकवचनम्"
In pointing out this haigre of the root 3719€7I have no desire to
press the conclusion on the attention of the reader that Jagaddhara
relers to Caritravardhana and not to Mallinātha in his commentary
on the Mälatīmādhava. This targni of the root 3719e may be found
in some of the other commentaries on the Meghadūta, but we need
not pursue the point any further. It is, therefore, clear that Malli-
nātha's priority to Jagaddhara cannot be proved at least on the
basis of unstable evidence recorded by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar.
1. Annals (B. O. R. Institute ) XV, 109–111: my paper on the
date of Cāritravardhana. According to Bendall (British Museum
Cata. 1902, p. 91), " aliaga ( author of âquett), whose full name
was aikaagfa, was a Jain writer, pupil of Kalyāṇarāja, himself a
pupil of Jinahitasūri of the Kharataragaccha, ( A.D. 1368)” Accord-
ing to this statement Câritravardhana's date would be "about A.D.
1400," while the date of Mallinātha is A.D 1430.

Page 413****************************************************************************************

8 TUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
If we accept A. D. 1400 as one limit to Jagaddhara, the sup-
posed priority of Mallinātha to Jagaddhara would conflict with
this limit. My friend Dr. V. Raghavan of Madras has recently
published a paper on the work, Vaiſyavamsa-Sudhākara, of
Mallinātha which was written for Devarāya II of Vijayanagar,
( A. D. 1422-1466 ). If Jagaddhara flourished before A. D. 1400,
he cannot naturally mention or quote from Mallinātha of later
date, i.e. A. D. 1430 or so. As matters stand, however, it would
appear that Jagaddhara is prior to Mallinātha if our limit of
A. D. 1400 for Jagaddhara as suggested earlier in this paper is
accepted and corroborated on independent evidence in addition to
my evidence that the work T1FATFT mentioned by Jagaddhara as
his own work in one of his commentaries is possibly identical with
the futra mentioned by Rāṇā Kumbha, (A. D. 1428-1459 ) in
his commentary on Jayadeva's Gitagovinda.
As regards the second item of Sir R. G. Bhandarkar's evidence,
viz., the date of Medini lexicon frequently quoted by Jagaddhara
in his commentaries, we may state here the views of Prof. Rāmā.
vatāra Sarmā :---
(1) Rāyamukuța ( A. D. 1431 ) quotes Medini.
(2) Padamanābhadatta, who wrote his Prşodarādivrtti2 in
A. D. 1375, quotes Medinī in his Bhūriprayoga.'
(-3) There is no reason to doubtº the authenticity of Malli-
nātha's quotation on Māgha II, 65 ("89: GETT 7979antra
heal”).

हारावलीमेदिनिकोषमन्यच्चालोक्य लक्षं लिखितं मयैतत् ॥"
4. Sir R. G. Bhandarkar ( Mālati-Madhava, Preface XX, fn. $ )
states that this quotation containing a reference to Medini is a later
interpolation and thus supports his theory that Medinikara lived
after Mallinātha. My evidence tends to support a contrary view
that Mallinātha ( A. D. 1430 ) lived after Jagaddhara ( before A. D.

(4) The Mankhaţikā contains a quotation from Medinī
("afafa senyar egasigafa 3774444TÒ Àgat:")
which if genuine would push back Medini's date to the
12th century for the Markhațī kā was written before the
last quarter of the 12th century.
As Prof. Rāmāyatāra Śarmā suggests the possibility of Medini's
date going back to the 12th century, our tentative limits, viz.,
A. D. 1300 and 1400 for Jagaddhara's date do not conflict with this
possibility. If we are able to locate Jagaddhara before A. D.
1375, before which year Medini was composed as explained al-
ready, we may be able to push back the later limit for Medini's
date before A. D. 1375. We must, therefore, await further efforts
of scholars who will be in a better position to give us the exact
date of Jagaddhara with the data laid at their disposal in the pre-
sent paper.

two views may be represented as follows:

My view :-- Medinikara Jagaddhara Mallinātha

of Jagaddhara — Between A. D. 1275 and 1450 1
In my paper' on the Date of Jagaddhara, the commentator of
the Mälatīmādhava and other works I discussed some new evidence
and tried to narrow down the sure limits for his date given by Sir

this date as recorded in the above paper were A.D. 1250 and 1650,
while the probable limits were A. D. 1250 and 1450. With a view

The chronological conspectus given above shows at a glance the

new items which may now be discussed here :-
1. My friend Prof. N. A. Gore of the S. P. College, Poona, has
given me the following particulars of this MS :- MS No. 3208 in the

lows:-"संवत् १७२६ समय श्रावण कृष्णाष्टम्यां लिखितं रूपमि श्रेण ॥ श्री कृष्णाय

the Librarian in a communication dated 18-8-1942.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
(1) My probable limits for Jagaddhara's date viz: A. D. 1250
and 1450 are now confirmed by the date of a Nepal MS' of the
Finaariat of Jagaddhara. This MS is dated Lakşmana Samvat
355 ( + 1118) = A. D. 1473.
(2) Mr. M. R. Kavi? makes the following remarks about
Subhamkara, the author of the संगीतदामोदर :-
'"शुभंकर himself mentions संगीतसर्वस्व of जगद्धर, who draws ,
some material from the commentary of frgaret ( 1420 A. D. )*
and also a ATTTH a prahasana written to amuse the king
of Nepal Harasingadeva of about 1420 A. D. Thus ***
has to be assigned to about 1500 A. D."
If Mr. Kavi's statement about Jagaddhara's drawing some
material from the commentary of Foregaven ( 1420 A. D.)is based on
reliable evidence, the date of Jagaddhara may be said to lie bet-
ween frate ( A. D. 1420 ) and A. D. 1473, the date of Nepal MS
of Jagaddhara's ar acarretar referred to above.
Even if the priority of Kallinātha to Jagaddhara is not proved
on definite evidence we can safely state that Jagaddhara flourished
between about A. D. 1275 and 1473 on the strength of evidence
gathered by me and recorded in the tabular statement given above.
P.S. - According to Dr. S. Vidyabhusana, Jagaddhara belongs
to the Kāmeśvara dynasty of Mithila ( 1350 - 1515 A. D.). This
view of Jagaddlara's date harmonizes with my evidence recorded
in this paper. (Vide pp. 521 - 522 of History of Indian Logic,

Date of the Hathayogapradīpikā of
Svātmārāma Muni i
Dr. J. N. Farquhar has dealt with “Muslim Influence” on
indu religion in his Outlines of the Religious Literature of India'
and assigned it to a period between A. D. 1350 and 1870 ( Chap.
VII). This chapter on “Muslim Influence” includes a note on
the Gorakhnāthis and their literature. The Hathayogapradipika'
a standard manual dealing with the theory and practice of the
Hathayoga forms part of this literature as the Gorakhnāthis are great
adepts in the practice of Hathayoga. Evidently, therefore, the date
of the Hathayogapradipikā ( = HP) according to Farquhar must
lie between 1350 and 1800 A. D. though he regards the HP as the
earliest of the three modern Hathayoga texts viz. the HP,' the
Gheranda Samhitās and the Siva Samhita.

earliest of the three. The Pradipikā and the Gheranda Samhită deal
with the same subjects but only part of Sivasanketa is devoted to
Hathayoga ; the rest of it is more like a treatise on ſākta yoga."

is further supported by the remarks of Dr. P. C. Bāgchi' on the
list of the Mahāsiddhase mentioned in the HP. These remarks read
as follows :-
"Svātmārāma Yogindra in his Hathayogapradipikā ( I, 4 ff.)
extols him, (i.e. Matsyendranātha ) along with Gorakşanātha as
the first connoisseur of the science of Hatha. In the same book is
also given a list of the Mahāsiddhas who are believed to have cong
trolled the influence of time by their spiritual attainments. The
name of Matsyendra stands in that list, second only to Sri Adi-
nātha i.e. Siva. This list does not seem to be very old as like all the
late traditions it considers Minanātha as different from Matsyendra.
It contains the names of some Siddhas whom we know from the
Buddhist tradition of the 84 Siddhas. Some of these names occur
in this list in very currupt forms : e.g. Nāradeva for Nāda pandita,
Țiņtiņi for Dhendhaņa, Virūpākṣa for Virūpā etc. This shows that
the list of the Hathayogapradipikā belongs to a period when the
memories of the great Siddhas had already become old.”'

Though both Dr. Farquhar and Dr. Bagchi regard the HP, as
comparatively a modern work, no attempt has been made by them
to fix the chronological limits for the HP. I shall, therefore, try
to indicate these limits on the strength of data available to me.
The HP is represented by numerous Mss' in the different
Mss libraries in the world and has been printed with Bengali and
Hindi translations together with Sanskrit commentaries from Cal.
cutta and Ahmedabad? besides the English translations from
Adyar and Allahabad already referred to in this paper. These facts
are sufficient to establish the popularity enjoyed by the work. The

Its author calls himself as Svātmārāma' and Sråtmärāma Yogindra
styled as “ Sri-Sahajānanda-Santāna-Cintāmaņi.”? No further
information about the author or his guru is furnished by the HP.'
We must, therefore, search for references to Svātmārāma and his
HP, elsewhere.
In a work called the Hatharatnāvalī“ the author appears to
refer to Svātmārāma, the author of the HP, in the following
verse :
हटविद्यां हि मत्स्येन्द्रगोरक्षाद्या विजानते ।
आत्मारामोऽपि जानीते श्रीनिवासस्तथा स्वयम् ॥ ३ ॥

3. In my article on the 'Uddiyāna Bandha of Hathayoga'
( Journal of the Orissa Academy, Vol. II, 1938, No. 1, p. 56 ) I have
reproduced the following entry from the unpublished work of the
late Vora Jatashankar Haraivan called the कविकाव्यकालकल्पना (p. 648 ):--
" स्वात्माराम गोगि --- संन्यासी, सहजानंदशिप्य, गृहस्थाश्रममा नाम मीननाथ,

I have no means of knowing the evidence on which the above
entry is based. It appears, however, that according to the above
unverified statement the HP was composed in Vikrama Sarivat
1687 = A. D. 1631. We shall have to see if this unverified date of
the HP is contradicted by any known references to the HP in
works of prior dates.

Gorakşa, and Atmärāma, as well-versed in all branches of knowledge,
as an author of commentaries on Sašadhariya, Manikanthiya, and
one Vedānta Paribhäșă ( other than the work of Dharmarājādhvarin )
and as the son of a great astrologer Timmajyautişika and Somāmbā.
He styles himself as the conqueror of great logicians like Mahadeva

with Svātmārâma, the author of the HP. As the date of the
Hatharatnāvali of Srinivāsa' has not been fixed, so far as I am
aware, the above reference to Svātmārāma does not help us to fix
any limit to the date of the HP.
A work called the Sivatattvaratnākara composed in A. D. 1709
( = Saka 1631 ) appears to have made use of the Hathayogapradipikå.?
We may, therefore, fix A.D. 17099 as one terminus to the date of
the HP. Let us now see if we can push back this limit of A.D.
1709 on the strength of reliable documentary evidence, especially
the evidence of the dated Mss of the HP. The Bhandarkar
Institute, Poona (Govt. Mss Library) contains about 10 Mss of
the HP. One of these Mss. viz. No. 399 of 1895-1902 is dated
Samvat 1751 = A.D. 1695. This date, therefore, may enable us to
push back the date of the HP say before A.D. 1650 or so. This
chronological limit does not so far conflict with the unverified
statement of Vora Jatashankar that the HP was composed in A. D.
1631.
The other terminus for the date of the HP according to Farquhar
would be about A.D. 130“ as he includes the HP in the literature
1. Srinivāsa describes himself as follows in verse 2 at the begin-
ning of his Hatharatnāvalī :
" वेदे वेदान्तशास्त्रे फणिपतिरचिते शब्दशास्त्रे स्वशास्त्रे
तन्त्रे प्राभाकरीये शशधररचित न्यायरत्नार्णवेन्दुः ।

quite improbable. The HP mentions AFFEE, art, ata, and TTTET

produced during the period of Muslim influence on Hindu religion
(13:0 and 1800 A.D.). If Farquhar's view is correct the date of the
HP must lie between A.D. 1350 and A.D. 1650, a period of 300
years. The Yogacintāmani of Sivananda Sarasvati contains numer-
ous quotations from the HP.' According to my data Sivānanda's
work stands midway between about 1500 and 1850 A.D.2 The HP
is also quoted by Sundaradeva in his Hatha-Sanketa-Candrikābut
(Continued from previous page )
who appear to be identical with Náthapanthi Yogis of the same name.
According to Mr. T. C. Das Gupta ( Aspects of Bengali Society, Cal.
Uni. 1935, p. 155 ) Näthism was borrowed from Mahāyāna Buddhists
and was current in Bengal about the 11th century A. D. In the
songs of Raja Govindacandra composed in the 1st half of the 11th
century ( say between A. D. 1000 and 1050) Mayanāmati, the mother
of Raja Govindacandra, is stated to have been “initiated into maha-
jñāna by Goraksanātha" and that she visited the pathaśālā of
Gorakșanātha containing 1600 disciples (Ibid., p. 188 ). If these
references have any historical value they appear to make Gorakşa-
nātha a contemporary of Raja Govindacandra about 1050 A. D. and
hence the date of the HP must be sought for after A. D. 1100 or so.

of this work, balue for our presenti, Marādeva, Rän
the date of this work being unsettled this reference has no
immediate chronological value for our present inquiry. The dates
of the commentators of the HP viz. Umāpati, Marädeva, Rāma.
nandatirtha being also unsettled we are unable to make use of their
commentaries for fixing the limits for the date of the HP.
Brahmananda, author of the commentary Jyotsnä on the HP, is a
late commentator as he was the disciple of one Meruśāstrin, who
was alive in A.D. 1859.'
There is a treatise on Hathayaga in Hindi called Jogapradipika?
by one Jaiyatarāma or Jayatarāma. It appears to have been com-
posed in Samvat 1784 ( = A.D. 1729). To what extent Jaiyatarāma's
Jogapradipyakā is indebted to Svātmārāma's Hathayogapradipika I
am unable to say at present as I have not studied this Hindi treatise.
Even if it is modelled on the HP, its date of composition viz. A.D.
1727 does not conflict with the date of the HP, as recorded by Vora
Jatashankar viz. A.D. 1631.9

şads are obviously late productions composed at a time when the
esoteric character of the Hathayoga had been thrown into the back-
ground and the necessity of manuals dealing with the enlarged
Hathayoga technique had been felt by the gurus and their pupils
alike. Though the aim of the Upanişads was a practical one viz.
the realization of tle Godhead by means of yoga and though there
are scattered throughout the Upanişads certain hints for such a
realization as observed by Prof. Ranade (p. 336 of Cons. Survey',

taken the highly evolved form in which we find it in the Hatha

The Yogacintamani,' a compilation of Yogic texts by Sivānanda
Sarasvati, which quotes from the H.P. contains the following verses
regarding the उड्डीयान बन्ध' from other texts :-

In the above quotations, the first three definitely refer to the

the last two taken from शिवयोग and शास्त्रान्तर appear to have a
reference to Tāntric tradition as is clear from the expressions
" उडीयानं ध्यायेत" and उड्डीयानपीठे तु तं ध्यावा.” The Hathayoga
practices appear to have a Tāntric background and hence in a com-

with Orissa. There is also mentioned in the Sadhanamála a deity
called उड्डीयानकरुकुल्ला i.c. कुरुकुल्ला as worshipped in उडीयान.' Indra-
bhūti is described as a King of 31419. Mr. Nalininath Das Gupta
in h s article on“Uddiyāna and Sahore" tries to show that Uddiyāna
was a place in Bengal. Many Tântric Buddhist scholars hailed from
Uddiyāna, for instance Lui.pāda, Ananga-Vajra, Thagana, Tailika-
päda, Saraha, Avadhūta-pāda, Nāgabodhi, Jõānavajra, Buddhajñāna.
pāda, Amoghanātha, Dharmasrimitra, etc. According to Mr. R. M.
Nath the ancient gran is identical with Hojai, locally called
Ojjai or Ojai. In spite of these divergent views regarding the
exact location of great the fact remains that it was a very impo.
rtant ancient seat of Tantrism.
As regards the genesis of Tantrism Dr. Bhattacharya observes
as follows:-
"It is then in ggfara that Tantrism first developed and was
probably transmitted to the other gies, BlaCar, rate and quifift
( which must be somewhere near ) and thence to the rest of India."
It will be seen from the foregoing evidence recorded by Dr.
Bhattacharya that gerara was the fountain-head of all Tāntric know-
ledge and practices. We have remarked above that the Hathayoga
practices have a Tântric background and this remark is vindicated

"We are therefore of the definite conclusion that Hojai ( in the
Nowgong district of Assam ) was the ancient Oddiyāna and portions
of the present Monzas of Namati, Hojai, Jamuhamukh and Duar
Bamuni were included within its boundary.” The clue to this
identification is furnished by the mention of EIPIT in the Kalika-
purāna Chap. XVIII (“ FØTTÀ Tegra fearg Gutai a:') This men-
tion of gfftra in the Kälikāpuräna is very important as it occurs in
this Hindu Tantric work which is earlier than 1000 A. D. ( Vide my

by the following verse' from the Hathayogapradipika as quoted in
the Yogacintamani ( p. 142):-
"q979H herfgefahfaat!
सर्वेषां हठतन्त्राणां साधनं योगिनो विदुः ॥"
The term asapoti is significant in the above verse because the
author of the H. P. looked upon Hathayoga manuals as 875? i.e.
as treatises dealing with Hathayoga, a branch of lāntric knowledge
and practice. As Buddhist Tantrism considered ggrant as its home
it is possible to conclude that उड्डीयान बन्ध was called after उड्डीयान the
home of all 597s referred to in the H. P. in the verse quoted
above, As, however, the H. P. is a late manual it forgot the real
meaning of the term ustan and connected it with the Sanskrit root
35i, to fly.
The Yogacintāmaņi of Sivānanda Sarasvati contains a quotation
from a work called शिवयोग referring to पूर्णगिरि, one of the four पीठs
mentioned in the Sadhanamālā referred to above. This verse reads
as under on p. 120 -
“ 94T8I41 18 BfHỂ fages quitara gì 1.

extract ushered in as “TIFIK " :-

(T. P. H. Edition ).
2. Evans - Wentz in his “ Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doct-
rines ", p. 155, states that the Lamas recognize 4 chief classes of
Yogic Tantras viz. ( 1) Tantras expository of the Thatness or Ulti.
mate truth, ( 2 ) Tantras of the Occult or Mystic Sciences, (3) the
Yogini and Shakti tantras and the ( 4 ) Kalachakra tantras. He fur-
ther states that the Yogini or Shakti tantras are traceable to a learned
teacher called Lawapa of Urgyan (or Odyana ), the ancient name of a
region, now comprised within the territory of Afghanistan 'in the
west' of India. Padma Sambhava of Urgyan first introduced the
Yogini tantras among the 'Tibetans. He is credited with having had
eight Indian Gurus belonging to the eight different Schools of
Buddhism. It would appear from this evidence that it (
Odyana or Urgyan) as the name of a region was known as the home
of Tantric tradition even in Tibot.

The Tántric works of Hindu' persuasion (as distinct from the
Buddhist Vajrayāna School) from which the above verses have been
quoted in the Yogacintāmaņi and which contain references to
quifatriots ( mentioned in the Sadhanamālā ) appear to indicate that
the Hindu Tantras had not forgotten their common home viz. the
several tits mentioned in the Sadhanamāla, such as the ggf1997,
qorcatfiato etc. Possibly in late works like the H. P. the Tāntric tradi-
tion was obliterated by the preponderance of tle Hathayoga,
though terms like Joieragru reminiscent of the country of the
origin of gris were still retained in the Hațl.ayoga phraseology.?

:-. If the position taken up in the foregoing remarks regarding
the common home of ( 1 ) the Buddhist Tantras, (2) the Hindu
Tantras and the (3) Hatha Tantras, which may be regarded as
part of Hindu tantras ( though the Hathayoga practices were also
current in Tibet,' where Buddhism flourished ) then we may be
able to give a definite starting point in the chronology of the
several works on the Hathayoga now available in Manuscript form.
As Tantrism first developed in Uddiyāna and as Indrabhati,
King of Uddiyāna has been assigned to a period A. D. 687 ~ 717
onwards we may safely conclude that the name Uddivāna as a seat
of Tantrism must have been current say about 600 A. D. and
consequently Jetaraaie is as old as 600 A. D. or to put it generally
it is as old as start fro where it was practised.
" Indrabhūti was regarded as an authority on Vajrayāna and
Țantra long after his time.” His sister was Lakşmimkarā who
became a Siddha and preached her own peculiar theories in a work
called sular, one copy of which is in the Oriental Institute,
Baroda, while the original is with M. M. Haraprasad Shastri. The
date assigned to this royal author is 724 A. D.? She was not only a
sister of Indrabhūti but also one of his favourite disciples. We
think this is a typical example in support of the study of yoga by
women.
As many of the Hathayoga texts are of dubious age and
authorship it is difficult to decide the exact antiquity of the three

bandhas viz. (1) the Múlabandha, (2) the Uddiyanabandha and
the ( 3 ) the Jālandharabandha as described in these texts. We
shall, therefore, fix at least one limit for the date of these practices.
Jñånadeva or Jñanesvara, the Maharashtra saint wrote his
masterpiece Jñanešvari in 1290 A. D. ( Saka 1212).' The Maha-
rashtra tradition states that Trimbakn in', the great grandfather of
Jñanadeva was initiated by Goraksa pathi, who was himself a spiri-
tual descendant of Matsyendranātha. Gahininātha, a disciple of
Gorakşanātha initiated Nivșttinātha and Jñanadeva and hence Prof.
Ranade thinks that he was a historical person. It would thus be
seen that the Natha-Sampradaya,? which is noted for its Hathayoga
practices had been established in the Maharashtra in the age of
Jñanadeva, who was himself a Yogi, having been initiated by
Gahininātha as stated above. Accordingly we find in the
Jñāneśvari a references to the three bandhas of Hathayoga. He
calls them by the names of “Hoia', “ HIDUE” and “arrati”
which correspond to the three Sanskrit terms मूलबंध, जालंधर and
grama of the H thayoga texts. In the detailed description of
these bandhas given by Jñānadeva we don't find any attempt on
his part to connect the grant TFT with the Sanskrit root get to
fly as has been done by the author of the H. P. Then again the

middle of the 11th Century, informs us that Matsyendranātha be.

the Yoginikaula Cult, which was closely connected with Hatha yoga
on the one hand and the Buddhist Tantra on the other. (Vide Dr.

term 'a TOT' used by Jñānadeve corresponds to the term
" आढियान " (a variant of उहीयान) used in the Sadhanamālā of the
Vajrayāna School of Buddhism. We are, therefore, of opinion that
A. D. 1290 is a definite chronological limit for the antiquity of
these bandhas and of Hathayoga practices in general, though the
chronology of the several arts will have to be investigated
separately. If negative evidence is looked upon as having any
value in this discussion we may state that the H. P. is later than
the Jñāneśvarī ( 1290 A. D.) in view of the absence of the H. P.'s
explanation of the term 5gtata finding any parallel to it in the
Jõāneśvari, which describes these bandhas in extenso, without the
faintest effort to connect it with “flying up” or “ soaring up.'
The usages of the term stora recorded above may now be
stated briefly as follows :--
(1) getara FT, (2) geteria , (3) rufa, King of
3121, ( 4 ) gatza ofiz, (5 Urgyan' mentioned in Tibetan Yoga
as the ancient name of the region to which belonged the teacher
Lawapa from whom are traced the Yogini or Sakti tantras.
Further evidence in support of our hypothesis that the term
gtart that of the Hathayoga takes its name from the country of
उड्डीयान and that the term जालंधरबन्ध does likewise is furnished by
the सौभाग्यलक्षम्युपनिषद्, a Shaiva Upanishads published by the Adyar
Library.
The Hindu Tantras, like the Buddhist Tantras, have retained
the tradition about tle ofis and tleir symbolic representation in
Tantric theory and practice. Tle À7277777877978,581 p. 113) alludes
to this tradition in the following verse :-
"महाशन्यं ततो याति सर्वसिद्धिसमाश्रयम् ।
reara al fwar gadicara: 117 11"
The commentator's explanation of the above verse concludes
as under:-
"प्राणानिलः कामरूपपीठादि सर्वपीठगतो भवति "
2. Dr. F. W. Thomas in 9. R. A. S. 1906, p. 461, footnote ---
“ The Buddhist Sanskrit form of the name of Udyāna is Uddiyāna or
Oddiyana, and the presence of a r or at least a cerebral seems to be
attested by the 'libetan Urgyan.”

The commentator Upanişad-Brahmayogin in commenting upon
the above passages from the Upanişad nowhere attempts to explain
the names कामरूप, उड्याण, जालन्धर and पूर्णगिरि.
In the above references we are concerned with the terms
उड्याण and जालंधर as the two योगबन्धs of Hathayoga viz. उड्डीयानबन्ध and
जालंधरबन्ध which have taken their names, according to our hypo-
thesis, from the countries of their orign viz. उड्डीयान or उडयाण and
जालन्धर, in the same way as the पीठs viz. उड्याणपीठ and the
जालन्धरपीठ.
We have brought forth sufficient evidence regarding the
correct derivation of the term उड्डीयान. We shall record in a subse-
quent paper some evidence regarding the derivation of the term
जालन्धर in support of our hypothesis mentioned above.

The foregoing verses tell us that our commentator Dhaneśvara
belonged to “ Daśakura” caste of Brahmins. His father's name as
given in verse 1 is Somanātha which is the same as Bhatta Someśvara
repeated in verse 3. The composition of the commentary was
completed in the year represented by the chronogram $T, FI, TA,
50, which is equal to 1312 Saka. Other particulars regarding the
date are ( 1 ) month of Vaišākha, (2) Sukla or bright fortnight,
(3) Guruvära or Thursday and (4) Citrā constellation. 'The
name of the Samvat as recorded in verse 4 quoted above is
Ananda According to the normal reading of the chronogram viz.,
"87, , FIA, FI"we get Saka 1312 as the year in which the
commentary was completed by the author. The Samvat year
corresponding to Saka 1312 is Dhātr' and not Ananda as men-
tioned in the verse mentioned above. This discrepancy between
the normal reading of the chronogram and the name of the Samvat
specified by the author makes our verification of the date quite
difficult. I am, therefore, inclined to:read the chronogram as
"TT, , TIA, FI” without changing the words of the chrono.
gram but merely by transposing the first two words “ FT, 65."
This reading gives us Saka “g. (1), and (2), TIA (3), C (1)
= 1231 Śaka = A.D. 1309. According to Indian Ephemeris? we have
Ananda Samvat for Saka 1231 and if my interpretation of the date
is correct the date of completion of the commentary by its author
Dhaneśvara would be equivalent to Thursday ,3 17th or 24th April
1309.

The above chronology for Dhaneśvara's commentary on the
Candiśataka leads us to the question of the chronology of the
commentary on the drama Anargharāghava, the authorship of which
seeins to have been ascribed by Aufrecht' to our Dlaneśvara. Let
us now see if these two authors of the name Dhaneſvara are
identical.
The Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute contains a
fragment of Dhaneśvara's commentary on the Anargharāghava viz.
No. 319 of 1884-87. This Ms begins as follows :----

As the Ms is incomplete there is no colophon and consequent-
ly we have no meins of knowing if the author had recorded any in-
formation about himself in the concluding part of the work. It is,
however, clear that Dhineśvara, the son of Somanātha and author of
the commentary on the Candiśataka is different from his namesake
of Bhāradvāja gotra referred to in the above extract from the
commentary on the Anargharāghava and whose genealogy' is record-
ed by its author in detail but which contains no person of the name
Somanātha.
The difference in the genealogies of the two Dhanesvaras as
noticed above is sufficient to prove the mistaken character of
Aufreclit's suggested identity of these two authors. I shall,
1 Though the text of the MS No. 319 of 1884-87 as reproduced

however, record some further evidence in support of my remarks

commentary after 1613 A. D. This conclusion harmonizes with the
reference by Dhanesvara to mirabeat, which is a work on music
composed before A. D. 1650 or so as it is mentioned by Ranga-
nātha in his commentary on the Vikramorvašīya (A. D. 1656 )
and by Nārāyaṇadeva in his Sangitanārāyana ( about A. D. 1700. )
In view of the foregoing data regarding the chronology and
genealogy of the two commentators of the same name Dhanesvara
we arrive at the following conclusions :
(1) Dhanesvara, son of Bhatta Someśvara of the Dasakura
caste composed his commentary on Bāna's Candiśataka
in A. D. 1309 ( Saka 1231 ).
(2) The above Dhaneśvara is different from Dhanesvara the
son of Udayaśarman, who composed his commentary on
the Anargharāghava after A. D. 1613.
It is, therefore, clear that Aufrecht's entry regarding the
identity of the above mentioned “ Dhaneśvaras" is not borne out
by evidence gathered by me from the available Mss of their works.
Both these authors appear to be separated in point of time by more
than 300 years, besides having different genealogies.

Mr. S. B. DIKSHIT, in his History of Indian Astronomy,'
observes that a Ms of work called fastar consisting of 300 verses
in āryā merre and dealing with Trettiota is available in Kashi
Rājakiya Pustakālaya’ and that the following verse appears at the
beginning of this Ms :-
नत्वा शिवं स्वविरचितपाटया गणितस्य सारमुद्धत्य ।
लोकव्यवहाराय प्रवक्ष्यति श्रीधराचार्यः ।
Mr. Dikshit concludes from the above statement of the verse
that Sridhara must have composed another work on grelotiora larger
in extent than the fagrar.
The conclusion arrived at by Mr. Dikshit raises the following
questions regarding the bigger work of Sridhara on the
grertfora :-
(1) Are there any references to this bigger work made since
Sridhara's time by other subsequent writers ?
(2) What is the exact title by which the work was known to
these writers ?
(3) Are there any extant Mss of this work traceable in
libraries or elsewhere, since Mr. Dikshit wrote his His.
tory of Indian Astronomy in 1896 ?
Though I cannot answer all these questions in the present
note I am able to answer the first two questions on the strength of
the following evidence which is no less than, about 450 years
old :-

LOST WORK ON PÅȚIGANITA BY SRIDHARA

Raghavabhatta who composed his commentary Padárthadarśa'
in A. D. 1493 on the Sāradatilaka refers to Sridhara's smaller and
bigger works in the following manner :
"श्रीधराचार्योक्तेन प्रकारेण क्षेत्रफलमानीतं तच्च स्थूलम् । यतो गणितग्रन्थानामियं
शैली यत् स्थूलं सूक्ष्ममपि फलानयनमुच्यते । तत्र भगवता श्रीधराचार्येण बृहत्पाटयां

फलमिदमानीतम् । तदेव सूक्ष्ममिति मन्यते चेत्तदा मूले अत्यन्तं फलाधिक्यं
स्थात् " etc.
It would be clear from the above extract that Raghavabhatta
in A. D. 1493 had before him the bigger work of Sridharācārya and
that he had used it ( ai karaf 77 3793177 HIT etc). The name of
this bigger work was 262916I while the smaller work was known to
him as fanaia which is the same as fatrat mentioned by Mr. Dik-
shit as stated above. About this work Dr. Eggeling remarks :-
“Ganitasāra also called Trišati, a compendium of arith-
metic, by Śrīdharācārya, the precursor of Bhaskarācārya,
whose Lilāvati seems to have been written in distinct imitation
of this work."
As Bhāskarācārya wrote his Līlāvati in imitation of the Trisati
it must have been very popular among astronomers of his time.
Our curiosity, therefore, to know more of the bigger work, viz.,
the Ecréi, of which the futai is an abridged version, increases,
but as no Mss of the Tri have been recorded so far we must
rest satisfied by trying to record all references to and quotations

Pt. Babuji Miśra states in a footnotes to the above extract that
Sridharācārya prepared an abridged version of this work of his viz.,
the qqavat, the name of the former being the fastar and that
M. M. Sudhakara Dvivedi has published an edition of the work.
The identity of the waiat with the bigger original of Sridharā-
cārya's work on the gratuita designated by Rāghavabhatta as caret
seems quite possible as stated by Pt. Babuji Mišra and the fol-
lowing additional information regarding the bigger original is
furnished by Makkibhattā's reference noted above :-
(1)
The original work consisted of 900 verses aurat and
hence was termed 7azrat or a “Compendium of 900
verses,” in Makkibhatta's time (A. D. 1377).
(2) As Makkibhatta quotes from it he had before him a MS
of the work and it is reasonable to suppose that the
work was quite popular in the 14th Century. This
conclusion is in harmony with the statement of Rāghava-
bhațţa in 1493 A. D. that lie had used a Ms of the bigger

Identity of Makkibhațța, the Author

sekhara , with Makkibhațţa , the Author of a
Commentary on the Raghuvamsa I
Aufrecht does not record any MSS of a commentary on the
Siddhānta-Sekhara' of the astronomer Sripati by Makkibhatta. We
must, therefore, thank Pt. Babuji Miśra, for bringing to light at
least at a fragment of this commentary called the Gaạitabhūşaņa
on the first three chapters and about half of the fourth chapter of
Sripati's text ( up to verse 75). Makkibhatta himself tells us
that he was well versed in many subjects viz. : (1) Veda, (2)
Grammar, (3) Poetry, ( 4 ) Vedāntir, (5) Logic, (6) Dharma-
śāstra, (7) Prosudy, (8) Rhetoric, (9) Drama, (10) Purāņas,
(11) Astronomiy, and ( 12 ) Yogaśāstra (verse 4). He is assigned
to Saka 12993 ( = A. D. 1377). Generally Makkibhatta follows
Aryabhata. The following references to earlier authors and works
are found in the fragment of Makkibhatta's commentaryº pub-
lished by Pt. Babuji Misra :-

from the Brahmasiddhāntavāsanābhāșya of Caturveda Pfthūdaka-
svămin, son of Bhațța Madhusudana. Makkibhațţa, however, does
not mention by name the source of his borrowing. The India Office

Items Nos. 24 and 25 in the above list prove that Makkibhatta
wrote a commentary called the गणितविलास on the बृहद्भास्करीय, which
Pt. Babuji Miśra explains' as the work of HIFT who was the chief
pupil of Aryabhata i Saka 444 = A. D. 522 ). No. MSS of this
ayforarase have been recorded by Aufrecht. So far only two
works on mathematics composed by Makkibhatta have been known,
viz. (1) the TROTTLT commentary on the Siddhānta-Sekhara
mentioned above and (2) coafara, a commentary on the
बृहद्भास्करीय mentioned by Makkibhatta in the गणितभूपण. It is possi-
ble that an erudite scholar like Makkibhatta well versed in different
branches of learning, as stated by him in verse 4 of his introduc-
tory remarks to the commentary foragt, may have written origi-
nal works or at least commentaries on works pertaining to subjects
other than mathematics.
I propose in this note to prove that Makkibhatta the author of
the Ganitabhūşana is identical with Makkibhatta, the author of a
commentary on the Raghuvamśa, a fragment of which is available
in the India Office Library. This identity will prove Makki-
bhatta's interest in Kävya literature.
The only reference to Makkibhatta's works found in Aufrecht's
Cata. Catalogorum is the following:-
'H E-Raghuvaṁsapradipika ( Sargas 1-9). At the end
of Sarga XIX, the statement is found that Makki
wrote the commentary as far as Sarga 14 and the
remaining Sargāḥ were explained by Jñānendra.*

chuvarśapraames differ in in Office
It will be seen from the above comparison that the introduc-
tory verses in both the commentaries are almost identical. The
Raghuvamsapradipikā contains 3 verses at the beginning while the
Ganitabhiusana contains 4 verses, out of which verse 3 only is not
found in the Raghuvamśapradipikā. Then again the last 2 lines of
verse 1 in both the commentaries differ in expression though the
metre is identical. A study of the India Office MS of the
Raghuvamsapradipikā may furnish more data to support the
identity of authorship for both the cornmentaries, which is, how-
ever, obvious from the above comparison of common passages and
which, coupled with the identity of the name Makkibhațța, needs no
elaborate proof. It would, however, be worth while to analyse
the fragment of the India Office MS of the Raghuvarśapradipikā
with a view to seeing what more light it can throw on the chronology
of Sanskrit authors referred to therein. Such a study would
be all the more desirable especially in view of the exact date of
Makkibhatta's Ganitabhāsana, viz. A. D. 1377 already referred to
in this note and the rarity of MSS of Makkibhatta's works so far
known, viz. : (1) गणितविलास (2) गणितभूषण and ( 3 ) रघुवंशप्रदीपिका.
Besides the Siddhānta-Sekhara cominented on by Makki-
bhatta, Sripati wrote the following works:- (1) Jatakapad-

dhati or Sripatipaddhati (2) Jyotişaratnamåla or Sripatiratna-
måla, (3) Ratnasāra, (4) Śrīpatinibandha, (5) Sripatisamuc-
caya, (6) Dhikoțidar Karaṇam, () Dhruvamānasa Karaṇam. I
am concerned here with the work Jyotisaratnamālā in tlie above
list. Pandit Babuji Mišra informs us in his Sanskrit Introduc-
tion to the Siddhānta-Sekhara (p.9) that there are many com-
mentaries on the Jyotişaratnamālā including one by Mahādeva-
bhatta. Aufreht' records a MS of a commentary on this work of
Sripati by Sripati himsell. Aufreclit does not say if this MS
contains the commentary in Sanskrit or vernacular. I wish, there-
fore, to draw the attention of the Sanskritists to Sripati's com-
mentary on the Jyotisaratnamālā composed in Marāthi. A rare
MS% of this commentary was discovered by the Maharashtra histo-
rian Rajawade and published by him in 1914. It begins :-- "llaar
ईश्वररूपा कालात मि । ग्रंथकर्ता श्रीपति नमस्कारी ॥भी श्रीपति रत्नाची माळा रजिता."
Students of philology will find much useful material in this speci-
men of old Marathi of about Saka 95:'( = A. D. 1028 ) which is
the date assigned to Sripati by the learned editor of the Siddhānta-
Sekhara. In his work · Dhruvamānasākhya' Sripati states that he
was the son of Nāgadeva and grandson of Keśrvabhatta and that he
wrote the work in " Tieutiare.”:3 Pandit Babuji expresses his
inability to identify this place or to state anything definitely about
the place where the work was composed or the birth-place of its
author. According to Mahādeva who commented the Jyotişarat-
---
1. Cata. Catalo., I, p. 213 -- ‘B. +, 184' - This MS was in the
possession of one Morarji of Vadhavan. As Lüller does not give any
description of this MS it is impossible to say if this commentary on
the Jyotișaratnamālā by the author was composed in Sanskrit or in
the vernacular.
2. Rajawade describes this MS as follows on pp. 81 - 82 of the
Bharata Itihasa Mandal Series No. 8 ( Saka 1836 = 1914 A. D. ).
The MS was fourod at Nevāse and consisted of 74 leaves. It was
written about 466 years ago as the copyist has recorded the years,
1369,1370, 1371, 1372, and 1373 on the reverse of the 4th folio. The
language of the commentary is almost identical with that used in the
Jõāneśvari ( p. 83 ).
3. This information is furnished by the following verse quoted
by Pt. Babuji Miśra :-
" भट्टकेशवपुत्रस्य नागदेवस्थ नन्दनः।
श्रीपती रोहिणीखण्डे ज्योतिःशास्त्रमिदं व्यधात् ॥"

namåla of Sripati, Sripati was of Käsyapagotra'. Mr. S. B. Dikshit
assigns Sripati to Saka 961 ( = A. D. 1039). From the fact of
Sripati's composing a Marāthi commentary on one of his works it
would be reasonable to conclude that he belonged to Maharashtra
or at least to districts where Marāthi was spoken in the middle of
the 11th century.
1. History of Indian Astronomy by Shankar Balkrishna Dikshit,
Poona, 1896, p. 237 -- Mahādeva states —

अभिधातुमिच्छुः आह"
Vide Bhandarkar : Report ( 1882-83). The author of Jyotiratna-
måla was the son of Nāgadeva and grandson of Keśava, who, of course,
was a different person from the father of Ganesa. This Keśava be-
longed to the Käsy apagoira while Keśava of Nandigrima was a
Kausika'.

59. New Light on the Chronology of the
Commentators of the Mahābhārata !
In the list of Mss of the commentaries on the Mahābharata
prepared by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar, the Mss of the Vidyāsāgara's
commentary are recorded as follows :
farerrari --- JETTA I ( on Fhraw)
- Comm. on ragaz
--- praraat ( on aficha )
3179Fzqi yai-z ---- 1970erzeit ( on 31971147942)
In view of the above Mss of Vidyāsāgara's or Anandapūrņa's
commentary on the Sabhā, Sānti, Bhīşına and the Anuśāsana
parvans we must thank Prof. Dinesh Chandra Bhattacharya for
drawing our attention to a fragment of Vidyāsāgara's commentary
on the Tiers recently acquired by the Varendra Research
Museum of Rajasliahi, Bengal (Ms No. 1898). We are further
thankful to the l'rofessor for his close study and analysis of this
fragment of 67 folios containing Vidyāsāgara's Jarut commen-
tary on the regala upto chap. 69 or so. With regard to the
date of this fragment we are informed by the Professor that it is
"about 150 years old.” We are further told by the l'rofessor that
this is “the most extensive commentary ever written on the Mahā-
bhārata” and that “thic author had an access to almost a bewil-
dering mass of Mahābhārata literature and indulges from the very
start with learned discussions on textual variations from a large
number of texts and commentaries collected from different parts
of Eastern India.” According to Vidyāsāgara's computation the
Mahābhārata contains 1,02,555 verses. Speaking of the chrono-
logy of the commentary Prof. Bhattacharya states :-“We would
tentatively place the author about 1700 A. D.” In this connection
I have to draw the attention of my friend to the following papers
on Vidyāsāgara published by Dr. Raghavan and myself :-

(I) In 1939 I published my paper on “ Date of Anandapūrna
alias Vidyāsāgara, the commentator of the Mahâbhārata — Between
A. D. 1200 and 1350"in the Bhārata Itīhāsa Mandal Quarterly,
Poona, Vol. XX, Part 1, pp. 29-36. I have proved in this paper
that Vidyāsāgara is definitely earlier than A. D. 1400 as we have
Mss of his works dated A. D. 1405, 1435 and 1568.
(2) Dr. V. Raghavan immediately wrote a paper corroborat-
ing my findings and published his paper on “ The Date and Works
of Anandapūrņa Vidyāsāgara” in the Annals of Oriental Research
( Madras University ), pp. 1-5 of the offprint sent to me. In this
paper Dr. Raghavan has pointed out that our author in his
Prakriya-mañjari states that he wrote it when King Kāmadeva,
a devotee of Siva, was ruling:
" श्रीकामदेवे जगतीं प्रशासति
श्रीशैलकन्यापतिभक्तिधारिणि ।
विद्योदधेरुस्थितमेतदारात्
staląd temaga vaall"
King Kāmadeva mentioned in this stanza has been identified with
Kāmadeva, the Kadamba ruler of Goa, whose inscription of Saka
1315 or A. D. 1393 describes him as a devotee of Siva at Gokarņa.
Dr. Raghavan, therefore, concluded : “We may, therefore, place
King Kāmadeva and Vidyāsāgara safely about A. D. 1350.”
It would thus be seen that Vidyāsāgara flourished about A. D.
1350 and not“ about A. D. 1700" as suggested by Prof. Bhatta.

Dr. Raghavan's account of Vidyāsāgara's Works shows clearly
the erudition and abilities of this great scholiast. This conclu-
sion is in harmony with the list of authorities quoted by Vidyā.
sāgara in the 67 folios of his commentary on the Adiparvan now
disclosed to us for the first time by Prof. Bhattacharya. This list
is similar to the list of authorities mentioned by Vidyāsägara in
his Vedāntic work Nyāya-Candrikā ( Madras Govt. Mes Library

1350 are very important for the chronolgy of Sanskrit literature.
I am concerned here with the chronology of the commentaries
on the Mahabharata mentioned by Vidyāsāgara in the Adiparvan
commentary before us. With reference to these commentaries
and their authors I have to observe as follows:-
(1) fa - He may be different from afast Mbh commen-
tator. Terase in his comm. on Mbh possibly refers to this
sia :-“ a fahoarish qarsijāsvra:" (Vangiya Sahitya
Parişat Ms ).
(7) T as -- This author quotes Àfazi lexicon. I have
proved the date of Argia to lie between c. A. D. 1200 and 1275 in
a special paper to be published shortly. As faTTATTI of c. A. D.
1350 quotes a THÀs we may fix up this commentator, between
A. D. 1275 and 1350.
(10) Ma- There is no commentator on the Mbh of this
name in Dr. Sukthankar's list.
(11) Jarca -- Do -
(14) Qazia, garaia - The earliest commentator on the
Mbh possibly before A. D. 1150. His ngaziat has been edited
by Dr. R. N. Dandekar (B. O, R. I. edition ) and the gegara Eror
has been edited by Dr. S. K. De, in the Bhāratiya Vidyā Bhavan
Series, Bombay.
(16) ATTITUiFst, at - also called HasartTZO. He is con-
sidered to be identical with his namesake the author of a Comm.
on hiera who according to Mm. Prof. Kane Aourished between
A. D. 1100 and 1300 ( vide p. 267 of Sukthankar Memorial Edition
Vol. I ( 1944 ) edited by P. K. Gode.) This chronology harmonizes
with Vidyāsāgara's reference to argua in c. A. D. 1350.
( 24 ) gra - This commentator is not found in Sukthankar's
list. Otra possibly refers to him in the following line :
"at graafaut fait arou3I".
the emprendiendo conglomeraten used by Vidyasagappears from
afa was a definite commentator of the Mbh as appears from
the expression “ingraziarah” used by Vidyāsāgara.
(26) HU -- Sukthankar's list shows the M8s of the com-
mentary of Aur on H and Fatra Paryans of the Mbh. The
comm. is called विषमोद्धारिणी (on विराटपर्वन् ).

(31) fagnare - He is not mentioned in Sukthankar's
list.
(32) haju - Sukthankar's list shows his commentary on
all the 18 Parvans of the Mbh. I have proved that faasata is
later than A. D. 1150 ( vide pp. 394- 397 of Annals B. 0. R. I.
XVII). Now that Vidyāsāgara mentions him (c. A. D. 1350)
the date of facut may be taken to lie between A. D. 1150 and
1300 or so.
(33) at 777 -- Sukthankar's list shows his commentary on
the patara ( 177TÀ ). f a refers to this commentator in
the following lines :--
" निघण्टुभाष्यनिगमनिरुतानि विशेपतः ।
वैशंपायनटीकादि देवस्वामिमतानि च ।
वीक्ष्य व्याख्या विरचिता दुर्घटार्थप्रकाशिनी ॥"
( Vide p. 270 of Sukthankar Memo. Edition, Vol. I (1944 ) )
(46) TYTJ - He is not mentioned in Sukthankar's list of
Mss of Mbh commentaries. In his article on the Mbh 'com-
mentators ( Annals, B. (). R. I. Vol. XVII, p. 185 ) Aug is men.
tioned. Prof. Bhattacharya states that FTOTADT mentions another
राष्टधर and his commentary called भाषावृत्ति and further points out
that TUTANT“ takes the two Tuts as identical." This identity
needs to be investigated.
It will be seen from the above notes that all the commentaries
on the Mahābhārata, numbering about a dozen, mentioned by
Vidyāsāgara are prior to A. D. 1350. It is for the first time that
we are able to put a definite limit to the dates of these commenta-
ries on the strength of the Adiparvan-- tikā fragment so carefully
analysed by Prof. Bhattacharya. It is wortliwhile analysing
Vidyāsägara's commentary on the Sahhā, Santi, Bhisma and
Anuśāsana parvans referred to by me already in this paper. I
hope that the information recorded and discussed by me in this
paper will clarify the problem of the chronology of the Mahā.
bharata commentaries to a considerable extent as all the com-
mentaries made use of by Vidyāsāgara are earlier in point of date
than A. D. 1350.

60. Authorship of Sarasvatīvilāsa, a Digest of
Civil and Religious Law I
Prof. P. V. Kane observes about the work Sarasvatīviläsa in
his History of Dharmaśāstra' as follows :-
“Pratāparudradeva, while ruling his capital Kațakanagari
called together an assembly of pandits and compiled an extensive
digest of civil and religious law. The royal author feels qualms
of conscience on the question of eulogising himself and his family
but stifles them easily by saying that a poet can also be an appre-
ciative critic of his own production.” ..... “The Sarasvativilāsa
being a work composed under the express orders of a king for the
benefit of his subjects makes the nearest approach to the Austi-
nian conception of law as a command addressed by political
superiors to political inferiors and enforced by a sanction."
It is evident from the above remarks that the work Sarasvatī-
vilása is a compilation and the "qualms of conscience" felt by
the royal author in eulogising himself and his family appear to be
thrust on the royal patron of this compilation. Prof. Kane, how-
ever, does not record any information about the Pandit under
whose supervision the work of compilation was carried out. This
information can, however, be supplemented by the note of Prof.
S. K. Aiyangara on the commentary of Mahimnastara by Deśayā-
mātya, who “says that he comments upon Mahimnastava through
the grace of Lolla Lakşmidhara, his guru (preceptor ), whom he
compares with the God Ganapati in wisdom. Lolla Lakşmidhara
whom he praises as his guru was a very celebrated scholar of his
time. We find him as the author of the Kondavidu and Kaza
inscriptions of Krishna Raya. He has written works on Astronomy,
Astrology, and the Mantraśāstra as well as on all the six darśanas
( religious schools ) and Law. He was the author of the work
Sarasvativilåsa upon Law, attributed to Pratāparudra. This
Pratāparudra was the ruler of Orissa, contemporary with Krishna-

raya, who became his father-in-law. Lolla LakşmIdhara enume-
rates Sarasvatīvilāsa among his works in the colophon to his com-
mentary on Saundaryalahari. He was the author of a portion of
the cyclopaedic work on Astronomy, Astrology and allied sub-
jects called Joytisha Darpana.”
We have, therefore, to take it on the authority of Lolla
Lakşmidhara himself that he was the real author or rather the
editor of the compilation Sarasvatīvilāsa. At any rate between
the rival claims of the royal patron of the compilation and of
Lolla Lakşmīdhara re, the authorship of the Sarasvatīvilāsa we are
inclined to believe more in the latter's independent testimony than
in the statements made in the compilation attributing the author-
ship to the Royal Patron, who is made to feel the so-called
" qualms of conscience." These “qualms of conscience" at
best give a plausible appearance to the claims of Royal Patron
regarding the authorship of the work. Secondly the fact mentioned
by Prof. Aiyangar that Lolla Lakşmidhara was also the author of
a portion of another encyclopaedic work called Jyotisa Darpana
furnishes a good analogy in support of Lolla Lakşmidhara's author-
ship of Sarasvatīvilāsa.
I wanted to examine the colophon of Lolla Lakşmidhara's com-
mentary on the Saundaryalaharī which gives a list of his works
including Sarasvatīvilāsa. Unfortunately I could not get any
printed edition of the work, if at all published, nor any Manus-
cript containing the pertinent reference. There are two Mss of
this commentary in the Govt. Miss Library at the B. O. R. Institute,
Poona, viz. No. 424 of 1884-87 and No. 824 of 1886-92. The first
of these copies is incomplete while the second is complete but
the colophon it contains lacks the pertinent list of Lolla Lakşmi-
dhara's works required by me. As Prof. Aiyangar has not docu-
mented his remarks I am unable to verify thein either in a printed
edition of the commentary or in a manuscript. Under the circum-
stances I must presume that the statement of Prof. Aiyangar is
based on reliable evidence of some Mss of the commentary of
Lolla Lakşmīdhara or other records on which he has based his note
on the Mahimnastava.

The present Ms was written in A. D. 1730. This year, there-
fore furnishes one terminus to the date of this commentary of
Lakşınaṇabhațța. The other terminus is easily furnished by the
reference to Rāyamukuta or Mukuta ( vide reference No. 25 in the
above list ) who wrote his commentary on the Amarakośa in A. D.
1431. We, therefore, get two limits for the date of this Naişadha
commentary viz. 1431 and 1730. Previous commentators of
Naişadha mentioned by Lakşmanabhațţa are :-
(1) TE ( vide reference No. 7 in the above list ).
(2) Atirgot ( vide reference No.-- 30 Teffarppi )
(3) fara of Mallinātha ( vide reference No. 9 above).
Prof. Handiqui' assigns Tetor Tlatt to about 1380 A. D. As
regards Nārāyana's date Prof. Handiqui observes :-
“Nothing is definitely known about Nārāyaṇa's date. It is,
however, certain that he is earlier than 1637 A. D. as there is a Mus
of his commentary written in Samvat 1693, being No. 368 of
1-84-87 preserved at the Bhandarkar Institute." Prof. Handiqui
also states that as Nārāyana quotes from Medinikoša ( about 14th
cent. ) he may be assumed to be later than A. D. 1440 and earlier
than 1637. These limits for Nārāyaṇa's date do not conflict with
our limits for Lakşmaṇabhatta's date viš. 1431 and 1730.
Prof. Handiqui' assigns Mallinātha to the “ latter portion of
the fourteenth century”i. e. between A. D. 1350 and 1400. This
date also harmonizes with our limits for Lakşmaṇabhațța's date viz.
1431 and 1730 A. D.
Lakşmanabhatta very often refers to a writer of the name aiga
( vide reference No. 51 above) and in one place he is bracketed
with the commentator JET on folio 27 as “Teftaisām” analogous
to “ Teriartrait" on folio 7 (vide reference No. 30). This
reference gives us an impression that aisa must have been a
commentator of the Naişadha. Aufrecht does not record any
reference to aisa or his works. That Lakşmaņabhatta availed
himself of many previous commentaries is clear from his own
statement made in the beginning of the work viz :-
"करोमि नैषधव्याख्यामन्यादृष्टपथानुगाम् ॥ ५॥
संति यद्यपि सद्वयाख्या बुधानां नैषधे शतम् ।
तथाप्य मुष्या वैदग्धी केचिद्विज्ञातुमीशते ॥ ६ ॥"

Though Rāghavabhatta's commentary on the Sakuntala has
been very much exploited by many annotators, none has cared to
investigate the facts connected with the family history of this
popular commentator. I propose in this note to record all data
gathered by me in connection with the chronology and family his-
tory of Rāghavabhatta and trust that other scholars who may have
made a closer study of his commentaries will be inclined to pub-
lish the results of their study to supplement the information sup-
plied by me in the present note.

The above references' show the critical nature of Rāghava-
bhatta's commentary and his vast learning. It is, therefore, not
a vain boast when he calls himself 'निशातमति', 'साहित्यरत्नाकर',
'सकलकलाशास्त्रप्रवीण' in the colophon to his commentary. The MS
used by Mr. Kale for his 1913 edition of the text with Rāghava-
bhatta's commentary was procured for him “from Dharwar by
Mr. G. V. Manerikar, Drawing Master, from Mr. Dikshit's
Library" (preface p. 1). Mr. Kale adopted the text of Raghava-
bhațţa without alterations, except in a few cases.
Raghavabhatta invokes God ‘गजास्य' or Ganapati at the begin-
ning of his commentary. He wrote this commentary at 'श्रीविश्वे.
श्वरपत्तन' i. e. Benares. He was a devotee of God विश्वेश्वर of

That a devotee of God fazar residing at Benares should
develop Tântrik predilections is quite in the fitness of things. I
propose to identify our T HE, author of the commentary on the
Sākuntala and other dramas, with the following 78TH] whose works
have been recorded by Aufrecht' :-
राघवभट्ट - कालीतरवरहस्य, दुर्गातत्व, पदार्थादर्श, (शारदातिलकटीका ). He
is quoted in तन्प्रसार (Oxf. 95b) in शाक्तानन्दतरङ्गिणी (Oxf. 104a), by
रघुनन्दन (Oxf, 292b), by कमलाकर ( Oxf. 279a), by विट्ठल (Oxf. 341a).
__Peterson' describes a Ms of पदार्थादर्श (शारदातिलकटीका ) in the
Library of H. H. the Maharaja of Ulwar and it is the colophon of
this Ms that enables us to identify our commentator of the
Sākuntala with the commentator of the Sāradātilaka. We quote
below in extenso the colophon under reference as it furnishes us
with all the points necessary for our proposed identification :-

available.
(4) राघवभट्ट is also called
“FIES Tarot”',' 319 32777;'

The colophon of the
Ulwar Ms is quite informative
and the author has taken care
to record the history of the
family in detail and hence we
get a more detailed account in-
cluding grand-father's name
and the date of the work.
I believe the above points of identification leave no doubt
about the identity of the two TETHEs viz. (1) One, the author of
the commentary on the Sākuntala and ( 2 ) the other, the author of
the commentary on the Sāradātilaka. In fact they supplement each
other and provide us with detailed information about Rāghava-
bhatta's family which may be summed up as under :-
Rāghavabhatta's family was originally residing at FPTFT or
Nasik in the Mahārāstra on the banks of the river Godāvari. His
grandfather Rāmeśvarabhatta was a very learned man expert in
dialectics (ATICAEHITE ). His son Pșthvidharabhatta was well-
versed in Mimāṁsā and Vedānta and was much respected by his
contemporaries on this account as also on account of his spotless

character. After some time he migrated from Nasik to Benares
and resided there till his death. At Benares he gave birth to a son
called Rāghavabhațţa who became expert in Vedānta, Nyāya,
Mimāṁsā, Mathematics, Medicine, Erotics, Music and other arts.
He completed the commentary on the Sāradātilaka on Sunday, in
the month of Paușa, Sukla Pakşa of Samvat 1550 ( Raudra ) which
corresponds to Sunday 15th December 1493 A. D.
The Ulwar Ms' is very important as we get the date of Rāghava-
bhatta from its colophon. As Rāghavabhatta must have written this
work when he was sufficiently equipped intellectually we can
assign Rāghavabhatta's literary career to the last quarter of the 15th
century ( 1475-1500 A. D.). His father must have migrated to
Benares before A. D. 1450 or so. Benares then attracted Mahā.
răstra pandits like Rāghavabhatta and his illustrious father and the
tradition is to a certain extent still maintained by the modern pro-
fessors at the Hindu University.

63. Identification of Historical and Geographical
Names in the Lakşmaņotsava, a Medical
· Treatise composed in A. D. 1450 1
In the last issue of the Karnāțaka Historical Review' Dr.
Har Dutta Sharma's article on Laksmanotsava — An important
work on medicine has been published. In this article Dr. Sharma
has recorded all important data furnished by a Ms of the work in
the Govt. Mss Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, viz.
No. 911 of 1887-91. The first chapter of this encyclopædic work
on medicine gives us a genealogy of the author's patron Lakş-
maņa. According to this account the author's patron was a resident
of Mathura and was a Kāyastha of the Māthura class. The B.O.R.I.
Ms described by Dr. Sharma is a copy dated Saṁvat 17672 -
A.D. 1711 and the date of composition is Samyat 15064 = A.D. 1450.
Authorship of the work :- The work is called urna. As it
is encyclopædic in its contents it may have been composed by
different collaborators. At least three names in verse 3 at the end
suggest this possibility. These names are (1) sharaf, (2) aterat
and (3) F ET. Three more names are furnished by verses 4 to 8
at the end of the work. These names are :-(1) GORA, (2)
जगच्छी and (3) अर्हदास. Dr. Sharma concludes that पुरुषोत्तम may

have been a guide and a critic in the composition of the work,
while 5778est and here were tl.e courtiers of the author's patron.
In verse 39 we get a reference to HOT after whom the work : is
named :-" MuaH TEROITETTAÁ Gà TIDEPOT:.” In the colo-
phons of chapters the work is described as Zetafra, and not
Sortiaa as pointed by Dr. Sharma. From these and other points
discussed by Dr. Sharma, he concludes that # was the patron
of the author. Dr. Sharma later records evidence which supports
SERU's authorship of the work, for instance, the last two lines of
verse 38 which read :-
" सोयं जर्वजनान्विलोक्य विविधातंकार्दितान् लक्ष्मण
कतुं तान्विरुजः करोति करुणासिंधुनिबंधं शुभम् ॥ ३८॥"
As Dr. Sharma leaves the question of authorship undecided,
I intend to help him to decide it by identifying the historical and
geographical data furnished by the work.
Genealogy of Lakşmaņa :- Chapter I of Lakşmaņotsava contains
41 verses from which verses 9 to 39 give us the genealogy of
Lakşmana which may be indicated in the following series of
names :-
TTAM - IES - FETT - GIGT - gaga - anes - 913 – 199fa-
FEUTTH - 1ų TATI – BATHE - 51159 - fax : - Tyxfi: – 4a-
57 TARTT - 37701 - Hetaal - Jacing-( Ts' or v. 1. HH-
TTST) - EHUT - 7190.
In the above list of names we are concerned with 40 and his
father BATIAE. Verses 32 to 41 pertain to Zegur and are more or
less laudatory. He is called FC979 (v. 33 ). He bestows wealth pro-
fusely (aigraraaga:), and is always full of tenderness and humi-
lity ( 7 :) (v. 36), He is dharma incarnate ( EH afhatica -
v. 37). This description of HOT supports Dr. Sharma's view
that he was the patron of the author or authors responsible for this
medical compilation which goes by his name ; because it is incon-

ceivable that an author who is described as 99 or full of humility
should write in a bombastic manner any laudatory verses about
himself. For huilt at 799,' a tank ( Stråtar), and a rest-house
( TÅRTOT - v, 38). We are told in verse 39 about the sources of
the present compilation. These are the samhitās of gra, arritz,
sfat, and a7. Besides these texts the opinions of Arrart, faizarer,
and others have been utilised and their essence incorporated in this
work.
मौलिक or भोलिक was the name of लक्ष्मण's mother as stated in
verse 37 [ gai HirESE (MS HIS laisrai...... great i fasa).
Amarasimha, the father of Lakşmaņa - Dr. Sharma states that
Amarasimha “ held some high position at the court of Mahamanda-
khân ( = Mahammad Khan or Mahmūd Khân ) ” as indicated in
verse 25% of Chap. I of the work. This encara is styled as

in the Imp. Gaz. of India, Vol. IX, p. 199, 1886 ) is Naogaon. Places
recorded as having this name are :-
(i) Naogaon = Nowgong ( A district of Assam); a town in
Bundelkhand.
(ii) Naogaon in the Rajashahi district, Bengal, between Hamir-
pur and Chhatarpur state. I am inclined to identify 7991 with
modern Nowgong the local names of which as recorded in the Gazetteer
are “ Naogaon” and “Naugaon" in Bundelkhand, Central India.
The Gazetteer states that a Rajkumar College in memory of Lord Mayo
was opened here in 1875. The distance in a straight line on the map
between Biana or sriqet and this Nowgong ( = Naugaon = 79DTH) is
about 200 miles. It is reasonable to suppose that this Naogaon
formerly formed part of the territory governed by Muhammad Khan
of Biana and SEHUT built a tank and a dharmaśālā within the territory
governed by his patron king Muhammad Khan. The possibility of
hur's constructing the tank, etc., at a place in Assam or Bengal
appears to be rather remote. The exact identification of Taur needs,
however, more evidence.

Vreme (v. 25 ) and 472t in verse 5.' The work was composed in
A. D. 1450 as previously stated by me. In verse 7 we are
told that HEHTAT was ruling when the work was composed. It is,
therefore, clear that in A. D. 1450 #cara the Saka king ( = Toner)
was reigning at sfrqet town. Amarasimha's mother's name was
PIEHT ( or SAT) (v. 26 - M IGHT ( SAU) Haraft y entrar:
greuta, etc.).
The foregoing lines give us the necessary historical and
geographical particulars about ut and his family. We have now
to see if any of these particulars could be identified on evidence
from contemporary or earlier sources.
Identification of sfig - Mr. Nando Lal Dey makes the fol-
lowing entry about stiger in his Geographical Dictionary,' p. 193 :-
Sripatha — Biana, ninety miles east of Jaipur (Indian Anti-
quary, XV).
J. F. Fleet has identified Biyānā with the town of the name
wtae mentioned in the Biyānā stone inscription dated Samvat
1100 = A. D, 1044.“ In this inscription the expression efigentei
git indicates that the name of the town was siger as used in the
eleventh century, while in the EHS composed in A. D. 1450
we have the expression gi frogaritat. In the first expression the
word siiqet has a feminine ending in 371, corresponding to the
feminine form gft, while in the second expression the word
श्रीपथ corresponds to the neuter form पुरे. The change of था to थ
caused by the change of gender of the word ", which has both
the genders, viz, feminine and neuter, need not be an obstacle in
our identifying siqe of A. D 1450 with siqut of A. D. 1044 which

HISTORICAL AND GECGRAPHICAL NAMES IN LAKŞMAŅOTSAVA 441
Fleet has already identified with Biyânâ in the Bharatpur State
in Rajputna.
We have now to see if the name sites for Biyānā was in actual
use in the fifteenth century. Fortunately Fleet has already pointed
out' that another Biyānā inscription dated Samvat 1503 = A. D.
1447 actually uses the name stinen ( spt 11 fareil 92 9402 arena
आषाढवदि ९ शनी दिने श्री श्रीपथायाम, etc. ). This inscription proves
beyond doubt that the name sftget for Biyānā was current in
A. D. 1447, i.e., three years before the date of composition of the
work JERTETE, and that it has been changed to write in verse 5 of
Chap. I of the work to suit the neuter gender of the word gt in the
expression afara sfragarria ater. It is, therefore, clear that
194 (A. D. 1450 ) = sfrutt ( A. D. 1447)
= sfiTuT ( A. D. 1044 )
= Biyānā or Biana in the Bharatpur State in
Rajputana.
Identification of HEHETIA : Dr. Sharma has already equated
#Tata with Muhammad Khān. We have now to find out if there
was any Muhammadan prince ( Tator 37TH ) of the name
Muhammad Khān at Biana reigning either as an idependent
sovereign or as a tributary to some sovereign power.
It appears that Muhammad Khân of Sripatha or Biana, at
whose court Amarasimha held some high position, is identical with
Muhammad Khan of Biyānā who surrendered to Mubarak Shah II
in February 1427.2 Mubarak Shah II was a Sultan of Delhi belong-
ing to the line of Sayyids' which ruled from A. D. 1414 to 1443."
Mubarak Shah II succeeded his father Khizr Khân two days after
the latter's death on 20th May 1421. He was murdered at Muba-
rakābād on 19th February 1434.
Though Muhammad Khān of Biyāna surrendered to Mubarak

Shah II in February 1427, he appears to have seized Biyāna again.
Mubarak then started in person for Biyāna but was withheld by the
news that Ibrāhim Shah Sharqui was then marching on Kalpi.
Between February and March 1428 Ibrāhim returned before Muba-
rak. Mubarak then marched to Biyāna and besieged Muhammad
Khān, who capitulated a second time. Mubarak appointed a gover-
nor for Biyāna and returned to Delhi on 30th May 1428.'
The Lakşmanotsava tells us that in A. D. 1450 Muhammad
Khân was ruling at Sripatha or Biyāna? (aftforat 1719 A v.7,
Chap. 1).
It is possible to suppose that though he capitulated twice to
the Sultan of Delhi between February 1427 and May 1428, he
might have assumed independence after Mubarak's death in A. D.
1434. What heroism was shown by Amarasimha, the father of
Lakşmaņa, in all the encounters of his patron king Muhammad
Khān with the Sultan of Delhi, we are unable to say. In verse 25
of Chap. I the expression TJ Quitar with reference to Amara-
simha appears to indicate that he did play some valorous part in
his master's battles against his enemies.
I have attempted to identify the names महमंदखान, श्रीपथ and

2. See Imp. Gazetteer, Vol. II, 1885, p. 418 — Biana is on the
route from Agra to Mhow, 50 miles southwest of the former. The
town is of considerable antiquity. It is a spot of great sanctity in the
eyes of Muhammadans. It is mentioned by Ferishta as a place of
importance in 1491, when it stood a siege against Sikandar Lodi. Babar
describes it in 1526 as one of the famous forts in India.
Biyānā ( = Biana ) is a railway junction being the 3rd important
railway station from Muttra ( = Mathurā:) southward (Muttra -
Bharatpur - Bayana - Sawai Madhopur - Kotah). Bayana appears
to have been famous for its indigo in the 1st half of the 17th century.
The East India Company purchased this indigo and exported it.

such an attempt in his analysis of the work Lakşmaņotsava. I trust
that Dr. Sharma as also students of mediaeval history will exa-
mine my identification of these names and bring more information
to bear on this question from sources which I cannot command at

64. The Terminus Ad Quem for the Date
of Bhānudatta, the Author of the
Rasamañjarī I
Dr. S. K. De makes the following remarks' while dealing
with the date of Bhānudatta, the author of the Rasamañjari :-
“The other terminus is furnished by the date of one of the
commentaries on the Rasamañjari called the Rasamañjarivikasa
(or Vilasa ) by Gopāla ( alias Vopadeva ), son of Nrsimha which is
expressly dated in 1428 A. D.” Dr. De further states that "the
comm. is dated Samvat 1484 = 1428 a. D. .........Mr. Shridhar R.
Bhandarkar points out ( Rep. of Second Tour 1904-06, p. 36 ) that the
date is 1494 and not 1484 as given by Stein (extr. p. 273 ) but he
thinks it is Saka era, in which case the date of commentary will be
1572 A. D.”
pressly dated in 142 alias Vopa de called the areas of one of the
As the above statement of Dr. De left me in uncertainty about
the exact terminus I examined the grounds of Mr. Bhandarkar's
statement that the year belongs to the Saka era and that the date of
the commentary would, therefore, be 1572 A. D. My examination
shows that Mr. Bhandarkar's conclusion is correct as will be seen
from the following facts :-
(1) Mr. S. R. Bhandarkar's remarks about the date of the
commentary under reference are as follows :-
" The date of composition is given as युगरन्ध्रवेदधरणी गण्ये गिरोवत्सरे.'
TF2 means nine and so the date is 1494 and not 1484 as given by
Stein. The era is not specified. But the name of the cyclic year
Angiras shows that it is the Saka year. So the era of the date of
Stein's Ms must be the Saka era since the date is 1514."

DATB OF BHANUDATTA

(2) Mr. Bhandarkar is correct in taking TFH to mean nine and
not eight as interpreted by Stein in his extract on p. 273 of his
Catalogue (sce p. 120 of Ojha's Palaeography of India, 1918 ).
Hence the year is 1494 and not 1484.
(3) Dr. Stein was doubtful about his interpretation of the
chronogram as he records it with a sign of interrogation thus -
" Tatacatoft ( 1484 ? ) og for acet.”'
(4) Dr. Stein could not properly make use of the incorrect
expression “spŪPOTIT TATT" as recorded in his Manuscript. The
correct expression is found in the Ms seen by Mr. Bhandarkar
and which he records as "STOTIŽTani.” In this expression the
presence of the anusvāra gives us clearly the word 'siftit instead
of the word FATTĪ which could not make any meaning in Stein's Ms.
(5). Mr. Bhandarkar is also correct in stating that Angiras
is the name of the Saka year and not of a Samvat year. This state-
ment is borne out by a reference to Indian Ephemeris ( Vol. V,
1922, p. 346 ) where the name of Saka 1494 is mentioned to be
Argiras. On p. 77 of the same volume Samvat 1494 is mentioned
to have Raktākṣa as its name which conflicts with the name
sinca as given in the Ms.
It will thus be seen that the date of the com. Rasamañjarivi-
kása is A. D. 1572 and not 1428 A. D. Consequently the later terminus
for Bhanudatta's date is A. D. 1572 and not 1428 A. D.

Mr. K. P. Jayaswal in his Introduction to the Descriptive
Catalogue of MSS in Mithila makes the following remarks about
Bhānudatta, a writer on alamkāra :-
'The Rasamañjari (a very popular book by Bhānudatta, a
Maithila (gati a fadat: , p. 52) has several MSS ( 38 to 38P ).
It is the composition of a Vedāntist, for the instruction [it is
reported ) of his own son. The author flourished in the fourteenth
century. The oldest MS is dated $. 1689. His Rasatarangini
( Nos. 36 to 36G ) is also a well-known treatise on sentiments. He
is one of the last writers of the Hindu State of Mithila. This has
as many as five commentaries.'
According to Dr. S. K. De,? the date of Bhānudatta, the author
of the Rasamañjari is ' earlier than the 14th century and later than the
12th century A. D.'
According to Mr. P. V. Kane“ Bhānudatta's father Gaņeśvara is
very likely Gaņeśvaramantrin, brother of Vireśvara, whose son
Candeśvara composed the Vivādaratnākara and weighed himself in
gold in 1315 A.D. Therefore, Bhānudatta flourished towards the
end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century.

BHÄNUDATTA AND HIS NAMESAKES
447
According to Dr. Hara Datta Sharma' the poets Bhānukara and
Bhānudatta are identical and as Bhanukara's patron was King
Virabhānu? of the Baghela dynasty, who flourished between A.D.
1500 and 1550, Bhānudatta 'should be placed in the beginning of
the 16th century A.D.'
The foregoing views of four different scholars on the problem
of Bhānudatta's date tempt me to record some more data having
some bearing on this problem, and which none of these scholars has
examined so far. If an attempt has been made to prove the
identity of HighT and HITET, names not quite identical, there is
every reason to examine the namesakes of HI777 and their works.
One such namesake is HITCa, the author of a work on dharmaśāstra
called the Pärijāta, a MS of which has been described by Mr.
Jayaswal.“ It is in Maithili characters. The work consists of prose
and verse. Jayaswal describes it as 'a manual of dharmaśāstra,
dealing with Tithivicāra by Bhānudatta.' The following two verses
at the beginning of the work give us some information about the
author Bhānudatta and his parentage :-
1. Vide Annals, Vol. XVII, pp. 243-258 — The Poet Bhānukara.
2. Vide my article on the Identification of Virabhānu ( Calcutta
Oriental Journal, Vol. II, pp. 254-258 ).
3. Vide Annals, Vol. XVII, pp. 247-48 — Dr. Sharma records
numerous verses from the works of HICÔ viz. the Rasamañjarī,
Rasatarangiņi and Gitagaurīpati, all of which are ascribed to
Bhānukara in various anthologies. I think this list instead of proving
the identity of HTIFT and H18ca only explains the indiscriminate
manner in which the names of the two authors were confused.
भानुदत्त was the son of गणपति or गणश्वर but the name of भानुकर's father
has nowhere been traced. Once the name HI77 was confused with
H184T even the parentage of the one was thrust on the other, as
proved by the following verse found in an anthology of Venidatta
( 1644 A.D.) called heart ( MS No. 375 of 1884-87).

" यथा गणपतिः काव्यङ्काध्यं भानुकवेस्तथा ।
भनयोः संगमश्लाघ्यः शर्कराक्षीरयोरिव ॥ २ ॥
वसुधा विबुधास्तर्कतिग्मांशुकरतापिताः।
कवेः श्रीभानुदत्तस्य पारिजातो निषेव्यताम् ॥ ३॥"
In verse 2 quoted above the reading 'गणपतिः ' in line 1 makes no
meaning. The correct reading ought to be 'गणपतेः' because भानुकवि
or भानु दत्त is here instituting a comparison between his own काव्य
and that of 'गणपति' and hence to balance the expression
'काव्यं भानुकवस्तथा' we must have the corresponding expression
'यथा गणपतेः काव्य.' The expression 'अनयोः संगमः' in the second
line of the verse appears to indicate that yrgafa is comparing his
own काव्य with the काव्य of गणपति, who is in all probability his
father.
If the above interpretation is accepted we are in a position to
state that गणपति was भानुदत्त's father.
Let us now turn to Hoga the author of works on alamkāra
viz. the Rasamañjari and the Rasataranginī, the problem of whose
date has engaged the attention of so many scholars, Mr. Jayaswal,
Mr. Kane, Dr. De and Dr. Sharma, referred to above.
In the work called Rasamañjari Higa gives information about
himself in the following verse':-
" तातो यस्य गणेश्वरः' कविकुलालंकारचडामणिः
देशो यस्य विदेहभूः सुरसरिस्कल्लोलकीर्मीरिता ।
पग्रेन स्वकृतेन तेन कविना श्रीभानुना योजिता
वाग्देवीश्रुतिपारिजातकुसुमस्पर्धीकरी मञ्जरी॥"
The particulars regarding Bhānudatta, the author of the Rasa
manjari and those of Bhānudatta the author of the Pärijäta may
now be compared as follows :-
1. Rasamanjari ( Benares Sanskrit Series, 1904), p. 247.
2. In the Rastaraigini (p. 23) commonly ascribed to भानुदत्त tho
father's name is stated as Turaid in the following verse quoted by Dr.
Sharma ( Annals, Vol. XVII, p. 245)-
'सावे निर्गच्छति गणपती नाकमद्यापि तस्या etc.'

(2) an identity of parentage of these authors, (3) a similarity of
description of the fathers of the two authors and ( 4 ) possibly
identity of the provinces from which they hailed. As the Mithila
MS of the antara described by Mr. Jayaswal is not before me
I cannot conclude anything more at this stage of my inquiry.
I would, however, request Mr. Jayaswal to examine this MS of
the Pārijāta and give us the benefit of his analysis in the light of
my suggested identity of the two Bhānudattas, as adumbrated in
the comparison of particulars gathered from the · Rasamañjarī and
the Pārijāta and recorded above.
I shall now explain the bearing of my hypothesis of the identity
of the two Bhānudattas : -
(1) Mr. Jayaswal states that the Pārijāta by Bhānudatta has
been quoted by Vācaspati and Candeśvara.'
(2) Mr. Jayaswal further states that Candeśvara is the greatest
name of the 14th century. According to Mr. P. V. Kane? Cande
śvara's literary activities begin with A. D. 1314 and if Cande-
Syara quotes the greata of Bhānudatta the date of this Bhānudatta
would be before A.D. 1314.
(3) Now if our hypothesis about the identity of the two
Bhānudattas, one the author of the Rasamañj arī and the other the
author of the Pārijāta, is accepted, the date of the author of the
Rasamañjari goes before A. D. 1314.
(4) This new limit of A. D. 1314 for Bhānudatta's date is in
favour of the following dates so far discussed and recorded :--

(2) Kane's view -' towards the end of the 13th and

(5) This new limit A. D. 1314 is against the following dates
fixed by scholars :-
(1) Mr. Jayaswal states that Bhānudatta' flourished in the
14th century. ' - This view will be untenable if the
limit of 1314 A. D. is accepted, though the possi-
bility of a junior contemporary quoting from a
senior contemporary's works may remove the incon-
sistency to a certain extent.
(2) Dr. De’s revised view -- end of the 15th and beginning
of the 16th century.'
(3) Dr. Sharma's view' -- 'Beginning of the 16th
century.'
1. Dr. S. K. De in his note on ' Bhanudatta and Bhānukara'
(vide Annals, Vol. XVII, pp. 297-8) doubts the reliability of the
evidence of anthological compilations, on the strength of which
Dr. Sharma tries to identify the poet Bhānukara and Bhānudatta.
Dr. V. Raghavan in his note on Bhānudatta and a verse ascribed to
him'( vide Annals, Vol. XVIII, pp. 85-6 ) supports Dr. De's view
mentioned above by citing a verse from Dr. Sharma's article itself
which is ascribed to Bhanukara in one anthology but is really from the
drama Balabharata of Rajasekhara.

In the above list of Anandapūrņa's works the MS of Saman-
vayasūtravivrtti referred to by the entry " Hall p. 96” is identical
with the MS described by Fitz Edward Hall in his Bibliography of
Indian Philosophical Systems ( Calcutta, 1859). Hall describes this
MS as follows :-
“XXXIX - Samanvaya-Sūtravivrtti -A Commentary on the
second aphorism of No. 1 ( Brahmasūtra). By Anandapūrņa Muni,
otherwise called Vidyāsāgara, disciple of Abhayānanda. The copy
inspected was transcribed in the Samvat year 1461, leaves 207, Slokas,
6900. Ben. Coll.”
This MS of Anandapūrņa's work was copied in Samvat 1461 =
A. D. 1405, while the Baroda MS2 of Nyāyakalpalatika was copied
in Saka 1356 — A. D. 1434 i.e. 29 years later.
Dr. Das Gupta' assigns Anandapurņa to the “Sixteenth
Century.” Elsewhere he states :- “Anandapūrņa ( A. D). 1600 )
who commented on Sriharşa's Khand ana-Khaņda-Khadya wrote the
Nyāyacandrikā in four Chapters refuting the views of the Nyāya,
Mimāṁsā and Vaišeșika.”* Anandapūrņa's Nyāyakalpalatikās
( Baroda MS copied in A. D. 1434 ) is also mentioned by Dr. Das
Gupta as also his Commentary called BhāvasuddhiⓇ on the Brahma-
Siddhi. The date “ A. D. 1600'' for Anandapūrņa is again repeated
by Das Gupta' in the following remarks :-“Anandapūrņa (A. D.

1600) who wrote his Vidvāsāgari commentary on Sriharşa's
Khandana-Khaņda-Khādya and also a commentary on the Mahā.
vidyāvidambana wrote a commentary on the Pañcapādikā.”
Presuming now that Anandapūrņa assigned by Dr. Das Gupta to
“A. D. 1600” is the author of the works called the Samanvaya-
Sūtravivrtti ( a MS of which was transcribed in A.D. 1405 as stated by
Hall ) and the N yāyakalpalatikā (a MS of which was copied in A. D.
1434 as stated in the Baroda Vedic MSS Catalogue ) we have to point
out that the date “ A. D. 1600” for Anandapūrņa assigned by Dr.
Das Gupta is directly contradicted by the dates A.D. 1405, and A.D.
1434 in which years these two works were copied. These dates also
contradict Dr. Das Gupta's date “ Sixteenth Century” for Ananda-
pūrņa mentioned once on p. 52 of Vol. II of his History of Indian
Philosophy as we have noted above. If copies of Anandapūrņa's
works were made in the first half of the Fifteenth' century how is
it possible to state that he flourished later in the “ Sixteenth
Century” ?
The evidence recorded in this paper suggests a date for
Anandapūrņa, earlier than A. D. 1400 in view of the extant copies of
his works written in A. D. 1405 and A. D. 1434. This evidence not
( Continued from previous page )
in his Introduction to the Mahāvidyāvidambana it scems that Ananda-
pūrna lived after Sankara Miśra (A. D. 1529) as is seen from his
criticism of his reading of a passage of the Khandana-Khanda-
Khādya, p. 586 ( Chowkhamba ).”

mentaries onc called Mahāvidyāvidambana-vyākhyāna by Ananda-

1. Even if we presume that the date of the copy viz. “Samvat

correspond to A. D. 1539 it is impossible to take thu date of Ananda-
púrna to 1600 A. D.” as Dr. Das Gupta has done. The Baroda MS
of the Nyāyakalpalatikā being, however, definitely a copy made in
Saka 1356 ( = A. D. 1434 ) it is iinpossible to presume that “Samvat
1461" is equivalent to “ Šaka 1461." We are, therefore, compelled
to investigate the exact chronology of Anandapūrņa's works in the
light of these two mutually supporting dates of copies of his works viz.
A. D. 1405 and 1434, and unless these are contradicted by any
other stronger testimony, the view developed in this paper that
Anandapurna is earlier than A. D. 1400 must remain unchallenged.

only contradicts the “ Sixteenth Century” or “ A.D. 1600” fixed by
Dr. Das Gupta for Anandapūrna's date but also upsets the date for
Anandapūrņa recorded by M. M. Prof. Kuppuswami Sastri in his
recently published edition of the Brahmasiddhi' in the following
extract:-
Anandapūrņa alias Vidyāsāgara wrote in the latter part of the 16th
Century a copious commentary on the Brahmasiddhi and this also
is available in manuscript in the Government Oriental Manuscript
Library, Madras."
According to these remarks Änandapūrņa flourished between
A. D. 1550 and 1600. It will thus be seen that the difference
between my limit of A. D. 1400 for Anandapūrņa's date and that
recorded by Prof. Kuppuswami Shastri is more than 150 years to
say the least and hence cannot be easily reconciled. I would,
therefore, request^ M. M. Prof. Sastri to examine his evidence in
support of his date for Anandapūrņa in the light of evidence record-
ed in this paper and give us his final verdict on this question in a

more authoritative manner than that adopted by a novice in the
present paper.
The Ms of Vidyāsāgara's commentary on the Mokşadharma
( Mahābhārata) described by Prof. H. D. Velankar in his catalogue
of B. B. R. A. Society's Mss' is a copy written in Samvat 1624 i.e.
A. D. 1568. This fact by itself would warrant our pushing back the
date of Anandapurņa alias Vidyāsāgara before A. D. 1550) and not
after A. D. 1550 as M. M. Prof. Sastri has done in his remarks
quoted above. Prof. Velankar, however, who records the Ms dated
Samvat 1461 ( A. D. 1405) described by Hall ( Index, p. 96 ) of
Anandapurņa's commentary on the Brahmasūtras makes the follow-
ing remarks about his date :-
"If this Vidyāsāgara is the same as the one mentioned under
No. 699% above he must have lived at the beginning of the 15th
Century.
The identity, suggested by Prof. Velankar, of two persons of
the name Vidyāsāgara, one of which is connected with the year 1476
(Samvat or Saka) rests on unsure foundation because there is
nothing in support of it except the similarity of name. But for the

Velankar states that the author does not quote profusely in this com-

2. This is a MS of पुरुषार्थप्रबोध of ब्रह्मानंदभारती composed in

विबुधराजसरस्वती while it was being composed at मळवली on the banks of
असनसी river ( मळवल्यमिधे ग्रामे शिष्टमसुरभूषिते असनस्यास्तीरतटे स्थित्वा दृष्टिमनोहरे).
The author alludes to भारतातीर्थ called विद्यारण्य, अमरानन्द (author of

Samvat year it would be equal to A. D. 1420 but if a Saka year it
would be equal to A. D. 1554.

two dated copies of Anandapurņa's( Vidyāsāgara's ) works, prepared
in A. D. 1405 and 1434. Prof. Velankar's suggestion of the above
identity would have been a good hypothesis to work upon. As
matters stand, however, I am compelled by the cumulative force of
three dated copies of Anandapūrņa's work (of A. D. 1405, 1434 and
1568 ) to push back his date before A. D. 1400 unless stronger testi-
mony leads us to conclude otherwise.
The other terminus to the date of Anandapūrņa is furnished by
his reference to विज्ञानेश्वर' and वैजयन्ती in his commentary on the
Mokşadharmaparvan. The date of Vijñāneśvara, the celebrated
commentator of the Yājñavalkya Smſti lies between A. D. 1070
and 1100' while the date of the Vaijayantī lexicon of Yādavaprakāša
lies about the middle of the 11th century i.e. about 1050 A. D.
because he has been identified with the preceptor, and afterwards a
pupil, of Rāmānuja whose life-time is variously stated as A. D.
1017-1137 or 1055.1137.“ In view of the evidence recorded in this
paper I am inclined to assign Vidyāsāgara to a period between A.D.
1200 and A. D. 1350.

chariar' records the following information about our author and his
works :-"Gangādāsa was son of Gopāladāsa of Vaidya caste. In
six chapters he describes in his Chandomañjari the varieties of
metres and illustrates them by verses in praise of Krsna. He
also wrote Acyutacarita, a poem in 16 cantos and Dincśacarita in
praise of the Sun. His father wrote a play Pārijātaharana.''?
Gargādāsa was apparently a devotee of Gopālas and perhaps
this devotion to Gopāla he inherited from his father Gopāladāsa.
He refers to earlier works and authors as also to his own works in
the Chandomañjari. These references are as follows:-

(3) दिनेशशतक and (4) छन्दोमजार. On folio 43 he quotes a work
of his own with the remark "ममेव गोपालशतके." Are we to take
गोपालशतक as a separate 5th work of our author or as identical with
1. In the edition of the Chandomañjari by Rāmadhana Bhat-
tacharya (1934), p. 152, the following note occurs :-
“अतः परं क्वचित्पुस्तके 'इति कौशिककाव्ये' इति कचिच्च ‘अथ शालतालतमाल

कंसारिशनक ? No MSS of कंसारिशतक are recorded by Aufrecht. In
the MSS at Bikaner' there is a MS of OTITIMT1# which is described
as“ an anonymous poem containing a hundred stanzas in praise of
Gopala." Is this गोपालशतक identical with गोपालशतक mentioned
by our author and from which he quotes a verse. If this verse
could be identified in the Bikaner MS the question of identity or
otherwise of the two works can be finally settled. Aufrecht men-
tions no MSS of any work of the titles दिनेशशतक or of अच्युतचरित. It
is really a matter for pity that the three poems of our author,
whose Gerart is represented by numerous MSS, should be lost
to us inspite of their being definitely mentioned by him at the
end of his only existing work. If some scholar at Bikaner takes
the trouble of identifying the verse from गोपालशतक quoted by
Gangādāsa in the extant MS at Bikaner Palace Library which is
mentioned as JTIT 277Fs and if its identity is proved, at least one of
Gangādāsa's lost works will be restored.
In the Chandomañjari our author quotes two verses from his
Acyutaśatakas ( on pp. 10, 41 ) and one verse from his father's

Pärijātaharananāțaka' of which Oppert records two MSS as we
have noted above. These MSS, however, are not now available in
any public library so far as I am aware.
Prof. M. T. Patwardhan in his History of Prosody2 refers to
Gangādāsa's Chandomañjarī but does not record any information
about Gangādāsa and his other works.
We have shown above that Gangādāsa quotes from a work on
prosody called Chandogovinda composed by his guru. No MSS
of this work are recorded by Aufrecht but the work is mentioned
in a commentary on the Vrttaratnākara, composed by Dinakara in
A. D. 1684. The verse from Chandogovinda quoted by Gangādāsa
on p. 14 of the Chandomañjarī reads as follows:
1. Ibid, p. 9-"HAT HTTD: TIIHTOETTATI. --
सिन्दरपूरकृतगरिकरागशोभे शश्वम्मदम्रवणनिर्भरवारिपूरे ।
संग्रामभूमिगतमत्तमुरेभकुम्भकूटे मदीयनखराशनयो विशन्तु ॥१३॥"
2. Chandoracanā ( Karnatak Pub. House, Bombay, 1937 ) pp. 558-
559. Prof. Patwardhan observes that Gangādāsa appears to have
horrowed some of his definitions of the vșttas: Udgată, Bhujanga-
prayāta, Manigunanikara, Sālinī and Rucirā from Utpala ( = Bhatta-
Utpala ) who flourished in the 10th century. He has taken some
definitions from Kedārabhatta and some he has composed himself.
In the 7th stahaka Gangādāsa mentions three varieties of gad ya
(prose) in the following verse :-
" अकठोराक्षरं स्वल्पसलायं 'चर्णकं' विदुः । तत्तु वंदर्भरातिस्थं गद्यो हृद्यतरं भवेत् ॥
भवेद् ‘त्कलिका' प्रायं समासाद्यं दृढाक्षरम । वृत्तकदशसंबन्धाद 'वृत्तगन्धि' पुन: स्मृतम् ॥"

Quoted Oxf. 198h, in Výttaratnāka rādarśa, IO 1555. According to
Aufrecht ( CC 1,972 ) 7777FATTFTTET ( which mentions Chandogovinda)
was composed by Divākara in 1684, JO 1555. The India Office MS 1555
of Vrttaratnākarādarśa was copied in Saka 1699 = A. D. 1777. The
description given on p. 304 of 1. O. Catalogue (Part II, 1889 ) by
Eggeling that this Commentary was composed in “ A. D. 1740” is
wrong because the chronogram “ quirfaraltà 999" refers to
Samvat 1740 ( = A. D. 1684) and not A. D. 1740 as stated by Eggel-
ing. Works on Prosody referred to in this Commentary in 1684 A. D.

The popularity of Chandomañjarī is proved by no less than
six different commentaries on it, viz., those of Krşñarāma,
Govardhanadāsa, Candrasekhara, Jagannātha Sena, Dattarāma and
Vamsidhara. Aufrecht records the following MSS of these com-
mentaries :-

(NW 616); by Govardhanadāsa (L. 2492:), by Candrasekhara ;

Dātārāma L. 2066. Oudh XVIII, 30( hy Dātārāma), by Vamśīdhara
L. 2534.
I am not sure if the commentary by Krsna rāma referred to
above (NW 616 ) is composed by Krsnarāma' who was a teacher of
Ayurveda in Jaipur Statc about 1900 A.D. and who is said to liave
composed a work on metrics called Chandaśchațāmardana.
The next commentator Govardhanadāsa was a Vaidya himself
like Garigādāsa. The only MS2 of his commentary on the Chando-
mañjarī recorded by Rajendralal Mitra describes the work as con-
sisting of 1067 ślokas.

Mitra.' The fourth commentary is by Dātārāma and is represented
by two MSS one of which has been described by Mitra.?
The fifth commentator is Candrasekhara and his commentary
is called Chandomañjarījīvana and is represented by only one MS
in the India Office Library. The sixth commentator is Jagannātha
Sena," son of Jațādhara with the title Kavirāja. His mother's name
was Devaki. Jagannātha is also called Kavirāja in the colophon as
well as in the opening verses of the commentary.
In the absence of any critical study of the foregoing commen-
taries on the Chandomañjari, it is difficult to say anything about
their chronology and consequently they do not furnish us with any
chronological limits for the date of the Chandomañjari.
(Continued from previous page)
This commentator calls the author of the Chandomañjarī as
fatterHTAT 1997.” Perhaps a study of this MS may make it elear
whether Gangādāsa Vaidya was an ancestor of Govardhanadāsa Vaidya
or whether only the kinship of professions is alone responsible for
the composition of Govardhanadāsa's commentary.

GANGĀDĀSA, AUTHOR OF CHANDOMAÑJARI
467
We have seen above that Divākara in his Vyttaratnakarādarśa
(fol. 226 of 10 MS) composed in A.D. 1684 mentions Chandoman-
jari. This reference gives us a sure terminus to the date of the
work. Then again a MS of the Chandomaſjari in the India Office
Library is dated A. D. 1679.'
Gangādāsa quotes (p. 14 ) a versc of Jayadeva. If this Jaya-
deva is identical with his namesakc, the author of the rhetorical
work Candraloka, who is assigned to 13th century2 we get two
limits to the date of Gangādāsa, say about 1300 A. D. and 1650 A.D.
But these limits are too wide and we should try to narrow them
down.
In the commentary of Gopālabhatta on the Krsnakarņāmſta,
which quotes a work called the Bhaktirasāmrtasindhu composed in
A. D. 1541 ( = Saka 1463 ) and which, therefore, must have been
composed between A. D. 1541 and A. D. 1605 in which year a MS
of this commentary was copied, we find that Chandomañjarī has
been quoted several times. On the strength of these references
to Chandomañjarī in a work composed in the 2nd half of the 16th
century i. c. between A. D. 1541 and 1605 I am inclined to narrow
down the limits of Gangādāsa's date to a period between 1300 and
1550 A. D.
The lower limit of A. D. 1550 for Gaugādāsa's date fixed by
me is in harmony with the remark of Aufrecht“ that the Chando-
mañjari is “ often quoted by Lakşminātha on Prāk,tapingala.”
According to l'etersons one Lakşminātha “composed in 1600” a
commentary called Pingalärthapradīpa.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The B. O. R. Institute, Poona, possesses the following MSS of
the Chandomañjarī:-(1) No. 383 of 1895.98 (2) No. 714 of 1891-
95, (3) No. +52 of 1892-95, ( 4 ) No. 715 of 1191-95, (5) No. 447 of
1899-1915. Of these MSS No. 715 of 1891-95 is written in Bengali
characters. All the five MSS appear to contain the text only.
No. 714 of 1891.95 ends as follows :-"yaa 960& fat gifJTETT ait 9
Hara HETIHTSFÄHTE focianat 7918779TT." "This MS was,
therefore, copied in A. D. 1750 at Savai Jaipur by a scribe of the
name Utimchand. MS No. 715 of 1891-95 contains the following
chronogram on the last folio :--
"20171fa tarte sa arafa ya "
I am unable to interpret the chronogram or verify it at present
because the words TOT ( =5), ICT ( = 3) and ( = 1) give us
Saka 135 and if this is equivalent to Saka 1350 we shall get A. D.
1428 as the value of the chronogram. This date may perhaps be
the date of the copy and if it is correct the limits for Gangādāsa's
date will be say A.D. 1300 and 1400 but this line of argument needs
more corroborative evidence before it is taken as reliable.
There is one MS of the Chandomañjarī in the recently found-
ed Ujjain MSS Library.' The Vangiya Sahitya Parişat contains six
MSS of the work of which four MSS bear the dates Saka 1767
( = A.D. 1845), Saka 1670 ( = 1748), Saka 1700 ( = A.D. 1778), Saka
1677 ( = A.D.1755 ) but they are not useful for the chronology of
the work as we have recorded earlier chronological evidence.
According to the description recorded in the India Office Cata-
logue of a MS of the Ujjvalanīlamaņi, i Vaisnava work by Rūpa-
1. Cata. of Oriental MSS, Ujjain, 1936, p. 44 -- MS No.
1148 (273).
2. Des. Cat. by Chintaharan Chakravarti, 1935, pp. 218-219.
3. Sanskrit MSS, Part III by Eggeling, 1891, p. 358b - MS
No. 1231. Dr. Eggeling observes that the authorship of the Ujjva-
lanilamaņi traditionally ascribed to Rūpagosvāmin is not endorsed
by the present MS nor expressly stated in the commentary. Mr. M.
Krishnamachariar, however, includes the Ujjvalanīlamani in the list
of Rūpa's works ( vide p. 288 of Classical Sanskrit Literature, 1937).
Jivagosvāmi's commentary on this work was composed in A. D. 1580.
The Ujjvalanilamani has been edited in the Kāvyamāla 95. For an
account of Rūpa's life see D. C. Sen's History of Bengali Literature
(Calcutta) 503, (vide p. 376 of Outline of Religious Literature of India
by J. N. Farquhar, 1920).

GANGĀDĀSA,"AUTHOR OF CHANDOMA ÑJARI

gosvâmin we find that on folio 71a of this MS (line 7) the
Chandomañjari is quoted. Rūpa Gosvāmi was born in 1490 A. D.
and passed away in 1563 A.D. If this Chandomañjarī quoted in the
Ujjvalanilamaņi is identical with that of Gangādāsa and if we can
suppose that the Ujjralanilamaņi was composed say after A.D. 1515
when Rūpa Gosvāmi must have been 25 years old and before A. D.
7563, the date of his death, we may be justified in concluding that
Gangādāsa's date is earlier than about 1525 A. D. so that the limits
for his date would be c. 1300 and c. 1500 A. D.
Mr. Pañchānan Bhattācārya in his Sanskrit Introduction to the
edition of the Chandomañjarī and the V?ttaratnākara (Calcutta,
1915 ) p. 5, observes that no one has yet determined when Ganga-
dāsa, the author of the Chand omañjarī flourished and in what part
of India. From a reference to the poet Murāsimiśra, the author of
the Anarghyarāghaviya, made by Gangādāsa in the Chandomañjari
we can only infer that Gangādāsa is posterior to Murārimiśra. No.
other proof can be found regarding Gangādāsa's date.' We only
know that he was the son of an ernient vaidya of the name Gopāla-
dāsa and that his mother's name was Santosā ( daiTag:). In addi-
tion to the Chandomañjarī Gangādāsa composed the Acyutacarita,
Gopālašataka and Süryaśataka.
In view of thic above remarks on Gangādāsa and his works made
in 1915, the necessity of the present paper on Gangādāsa and his
works will be easily appreciated as I have here attempted to focus
together some useful data which will go to clarify the issues
regarding Gangādāsa and his works to some extent at least.

1. Miśra Jagannātha who composed his Chandaḥpīyāşa between
A.D. 1750 and 1793 ( vide my article in New Indian Antiquary, Vol. I
p. 682) states that Nārāyaṇa, the commentator of the Vșttaratnakara
opposes the views of Maijari or Chandomanjari (मञ्जयुक्तधनुरुन्धानानां
ATTTTTTTTT). Nārāyaṇa composed his commentary in A. D. 1545. If
the statement of Miśra Jagannātha mentioned above is correct
Nārāyaṇa becomes posterior to Gargādāsa that is to say the work
Chandomañjari becomes earlier than A. D. 1545, the date of Nārā-
yaņa's commentary on the Vịttaratnākara. This argument, if
accepted, would also support the limit of A. D. 1500 for Gangādāsa's
date fixed by me on other independent evidence recorded in this
paper.

on yoga viz. (1)“ Kaçin. 30” and (2) “ Bhr. 220.” The first
of these MSS is not available for examination, being in private
possession as far back as 1880 when the list indicated by the entry
“Kaçin” was made. The second MS of Aufrecht's entries viz.
"Bhr.220” is the same as No. 220 of 1882-83 of the Government MSS
Library at the B. (). R. Institute, Poona. It is fragmentary, many
of the folios in the body of the manuscript having been lost
previous to its acquisition from Gujarat by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar.
The beginning and end of the MS have, however, been preserved
intact and afford useful historical data about the author and his
date.
Aufrecht wrongly ascribes this work to Gorakşanātha. The
colophon of the 4th Pariccheda on folio 131 reads — “ft TTEITIÀY
(faziala gizarauit).” The letter at appears to have been dropped
from the name “ TER recorded in this colophon. A verse at
the end of the MS gives the correct name of the author viz.
“ Teat” and not“ mar.” This verse reads :--

2. This Yogacintamani is a work on Yoga and should be dis-
tinguished from another work of the same name on Materia medica

Harşakirti belonged to the Nāga pura Tapāgaccha. Candrakirti was
honoured by Salem Shah who was emperor of Delhi between 1545 and
1553 A. 1). ( vide R. G. B. Report 1882-83, p. 43—Extract on p. 227 ).
Candrakirti commented on the Sārasvataprakriyā of Anubhūtisvarū.
pācārya. Another writer who belonged to this Nāgapuriya Tapo-
gaña is Amarakirti who composed a commentary on the Řtusamhāra

published in 1912 with a Gujarati commentary by Puranacandra
Sarma of Ahmedabad.

The above extract gives us the following information about the
work and its author :-
(1) गोदावरमिश्र, the author of the योगचिंतामणि was the राजगुरु or
royal preceptor of गजपति प्रतापरुद्रदेव. He was called कविपुंगव, पंडित.
राज on account of his great learning and वाजपेययाजि perhaps on
account of his having performed a to sacrifice.
(2) The MS was copied at Benares in Samvat 1772 in the
month of Kärttika, dark fortnight (Vadi) on Budhavāsara which
was an amāvāsyā day.'

not been disclosed to us. We may now tabulate these works as
follows:--

referred to
as पितामहचरणैः
and पितामहचरणाः ।
(1) काशीमीमांसा ,
, (2) संक्षेपशारीरकवार्तिक

। (2) तन्त्रचिंतामणि
(3) (अ)द्वैतदर्पण
(3) गोदावरमिश्र
referred to
as अस्माभिः
As the MS analysed by me is fragmentary we cannot say it
Godāvaramiśra has recorded any other works in the Yogacintamani
(in addition to those recorded in the above list ) composed by the
members of his family. Judging, however, by the names of the
above works we are justified in supposing that the family of this
royal preceptor or राजगुरु of गजपति प्रतापरुद्रदेव was a very learned one
and hence must have been respected and honoured at the court of
Pratāparudradeva some generations earlier than our author, who
was himself a highly honoured राजगुरु as his titles कविपुंगव, पंडितराज,
and arra amply indicate in the colophons before us. In verse
2 at the commencement of the work the author states that his father
बलभद्र was his विद्यागुरु (बलभद्रसंज्ञं विद्यागुरुं...नमामि ). The avowed
purpose of writing the present work on Yoga is indicated by the
author in verse 3 as follows:--
'ययासवाचस्पतिभोजदेवैः
पातंजलीयं निरणायि तत्वं । .
अन्यत्र सिद्धं यदपेक्षितं च
तदत्र संक्षिप्य निरूपयामि ॥३॥"
The work is, therefore, a compendium or a manual based on
the principles and practice of Yoga as enjoined by the Yogasutra
ascribed to Patañjali and elucidated by Vyāsa, Vācaspati, and Bhoja-
deva, whose commentaries on the Yogasūtras are available to us now
as they were available to Godāvaramiśra. The present work is also
supplemented by material from other sources not incorporated by
the above commentators in their commentaries. The object of
yoga theory and practice being Mokṣa or final emancipation, the

Page 514****************************************************************************************
GODAVARAMIŚRA AND HIS WORKS
475
author has briefly stated, in his work for the benefit of the mumuksu
or seeker after emancipation, such Yogic practices as are conducive
to such emancipation. Other theoretic and psychic aspects of the
Yoga have not been dealt with in this work for fear of increasing the
bulk of the manual. They have been discussed at length, as the
author tells us, by his respected grandfather (foarhaazú:) in his
संक्षेपशारीरकवार्तिक and by his father ( पितृचरणैः ) Balabhadra in his अद्वैत-
FEMTATO as also by our author himself in his ( 37 )gacio: “ FRITT.
acgoriegaforar:." The author further informs us that he has
deliberately excluded from the present treatise those details of
Yogic theory and practice which are enjoined as essential in Tântric
manuals (" 77191 Sasiipfit: fa5197:”) because they are opposed to
the teaching of the yra and egra.
According to the colophons quoted above Godāvaramiśra was
the rājaguru or royal preceptor of Gajapati Pratāparudradeva. I am
inclined to identify this king with Gajapati Pratāparudradeval of
Orissa who ruled between A.D. 1497 and 1539. If this identification
is accepted, the date of the Yogacintāmaņi can be safely assigned to
the first quarter of the 16th century. This conclusion is in con-
sonance with the reference to Bhojadeva (c. A. D. 1050 ) made by
our author and the date of the MS before us viz. A.D. 1716.
Unfortunately the list of authorities cited by Godāvaramiśra
furnishes no other clue to the earlier limit for the date of the
present work than Bhojadeva (c. A.D. 1050). Gajapati Pratāpa-
rudradeva belonged to the Solar Dynasty of Orissa that ruled
between A. D. 1435 and 1540, a period during which Orissa attained
its highest glory in all directions. It is possible to suppose that
the family of Godāvaramiśra must have been patronized by the
predecessors of Prataparudradeva vix. पुरुपोत्तमदेव and कपिलेन्द्रदेव.
1. Vide p. 413 of P. V. Kane : History' of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. I
( 1930).
2. Vide p. 213 of Orissa in the Making by B. C. Mazumdar,
Calcutta University, 1925. The Solar dynasty was a shortlived one
as it lasted for three generations represented hy Fígarea, his son
पुरुषोत्तमदेव and his gradson प्रतापरुद्रदेव. Govinda Vidyadhara, a minister
of Pratâparudradeva, assassinated the sons of his master and usurped
his throne in A. D. 1541. He was a Bhoi by caste. His two succes-
sors were also Bhois. They were succeeded by Telengā Mukunda
Deva who died in A. D. 1568. After his death Orissa came under
the rule of Mahomedans.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
Pratāparudradeva was the father-in-law' of Kțşnadevarāya of
Vijayanagar. The dharmaśāstra work Sarasvatīvilāsa though attri-
buted to Prataparudra was composed by Lolla Lakşmidhara, who
spent his early days at the court of the Gajapati at Cuttack and
then migrated to Krsnadevarāya's court. It is thus clear that
Godāvaramiśra, the rājaguru of Gajapati Pratāparudra was a con-
temporary of Lolla Lakşmidhara, the real author of the Sarasvati-
vilāsa. It is also clear that Pratāparudra was a great patron of
letters. He should not be confounded with Prataparudra of the
Kākatiya dynasty (Warrangal), the patron of Vidyānātha, the
author of the Pratā parudra-yaśobhūşaņa. This king ruled between
A. D. 1568 and ( 1319? ) 1328 A. D.5
It appears that our Godāvaramiśra composed a work called
TETTT97 which is represented by a MS in the Govt. Oriental
MSS Library, Madras. My friend Prof. V.R. R. Dikshitar recently
sent me a copy of his erudite volume on War in Ancient Indias

GODÅVARAMIŚRA AND HIS WORKS
477
It is the work of Kuruvājapeyayāji' Godāvaramiśra, the
minister of Mahārājādhirāja Gajapati Pratāparudradeva. Thus the
work belongs to the 15th century A. D. (or the early 16th). Its
study is valuable in that it indicates the continuity of traditional
methods and prescriptions, and in this connection furnishes
additional information from sources known to the author at the
time of composition. This manuscript of the Harihara-Caturanga
is divided into 8 books. The first four deal with the fourfold force
in the order of elephants, chariots, horses and infantry. While the
sections on elephants and horses occupy nearly 90 pages respective-
ly, the information under the headings of chariots and infantry is
meagre and occupies about four pages in the manuscript. The last
four books deal respectively with Dhanurveda, Rājaniti, Dhanur-
vidyā and Kridãyuddha, ( This last is a period of training or
apprenticeship after the period of study is over ). In the opening
lines of book V the author expresses his indebtedness to previous
works on the Dhanurveda and in this connection mentions four
works -- the Auśanasasamhitā, Viracintāmaņi, Kodanda Caturbhujam
and Sārasangraham, all of which are probably lost today. Towards
the end of the sixth book, another work, called Jayacintāmani is
referred to. It is said to be a work bearing on astronomy and
astrology and the king is advised therein to set out on an expedition
at an auspicious time.”
The name of the author is recorded in the following lines ‘at
the commencement of the work :-
" श्रीदुर्गाचरणाम्भोजद्वन्द्वचन्दनबिन्दुना।
कृतिगादावरणयं तत्प्रसादाद्विरिच्यते ।
FITTITETITTETE ( 1 ) grazreai wari"
At the end also similar lines are recorded as follows :-
" यत्प्रसादादिमां चक्रे धीरगोदावरः कृतिम् ।
श्रीदुर्गाचरणाम्भोजे तस्मिन्नेतां समर्पये ॥"
The following colophon is identical with that in the Yoga-
cintāmaņi —
इति श्रीमन्महाराजाधिराज गजपतिप्रतापरुद्रदेव - स्वहस्तधारितकनककेसरी-

It is clear from the above extracts that Godāvaramiśra, the
author of the Yogacintāmaņi and his name-sake, the author of the
Harihara-Caturarga, are identical.
Prof. Dikshitar states that the Harihara-Caturariga mentions
four earlier works :
(1) Tahfear (2) alfararafor
(3) Fiquez (4) HAE
and that all of these are probably lost today. Perhaps it may be
possible to trace some of these works or their MSS. Aufrecht
makes the following entry regarding the वीरचिन्तामणि :-

The Sarrigadharapaddhati was composed in A. 1). 1363 by IT and
if the वीरचिन्तामणि mentioned by गोदावरमिश्र is identical with Ch. 80
(on Dhanurveda ) of the Sāriigadharapaddhati we can easily fix a. D.
1400 as the earlier terminus for the date of Godāvaramiśra. This
terminus harmonises with the date of this author- minister of
Gajapati Pratāparudradeva fixed by me already in this paper.
1. In the Yogacintāmaņi we have “qrôz75 11775.”
2. This epithet 77-797 is not recorded in the colophon of the

the epithet Atraat is also recorded.

DATE OF RASASANKETAKALIKA OF KAYASTHA
CĀMUNDA AND HIS REFERENCE TO AN
ANECDOTE ABOUT KING SIMHANA.
Vaidya Jadavaji Trikamji Acharya, whose efforts in the cause
of the publication of ancient works on Indian Medicine are really
praiseworthy, has published in the Ayurvedīyagrantha' mālā a work
on rasas or Medical preparations called the Rasasanketakalikā.' In
the preface to this work the Editor makes the following remarks
regarding the author and the importance of his work :-
- "स चायं चामुण्डः कस्मिन् समये कतमे वा जनपदे समजनीति निर्णेतुं न
किञ्चिदपि साधनमुपलभ्यते । ग्रंथश्वायं लघुरपि अतिसरलत्वात् विशदार्थत्वात् दृष्टप्रत्यया-
ल्पप्रयत्नसाध्यप्रयोगवरवाच रसचिकित्साग्रन्थेषु मूर्धन्यः। पुत्रप्रदरसप्रभृतयः केचन
अपूर्वप्रयोगा अप्यत्रोपलभ्यन्ते।"
In the above remarks, I am here concerned with the date of
the author of the Rasasanketakalikā and not with the medical value
of the treatise which an editor of Vaidya Jadavaji's status and
reputation is most competent to judge.
When the above book was published Aufrecht's Catalogus
Catalogorum was in existence. It appears, however, that this
Catalogue has not been used by the Editor in making the remarks
quoted above to the effect that there are no means for determining
the place and time of Cāmunda, the author of this Rasasanketakalika.
The following entry in Aufrecht's Catalogue would certainly have
helped the Editor to study the question more carefully :-

"चामुण्ड' or चण्ड कायस्थ wrote at Medapata under King Rajamalla
( 1489 ): 59tratATHIFFT med. Bik. 643. Lahore 22; T137 idol med.
L. 910. K. 216, Oudh 1877, 62.” In an article contributed by me
to the Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute (Vol. XII, pp. 294 ---- 296)
I have proved that Cāmunda Kāyastha wrote his Fvaratimirabhāskara
in Sanivat 1546 ( = A. D. 1490) during the reign of King Rājamalla
of Mewad ( 1474 to 1509 ). I shall, therefore, try in this paper to
prove the identity of the Author of the Jvaratimirabhāskara with
the author of the Rasasanketakalikā.
In the first verse of the Rasasanketkalika the author states that
he composed the work and that his name is “ FONS: FRTF?*274:.”
In the last verse of the fvaratimirabhāskara ( v. 63 on folio 116 of
MS No. 9202 of 1884 --- 87 ) the author calls himself “f178273JAT.”
This identity of names is not sufficient to prove the identity of
authorship for the two works under reference because in the Rasasa-
rketakalikā no chronological and historical data are available. I have,
therefore, tried to find if any verses are common to both the works.
Fortunately my cursory perusal of both the works has enabled me
to detect the following lines in the Rasasariketakalikā which are
found also in the Jvaratimirabhāskara:-
1. Aufrecht, III. 40 inentions a 29 as the author of a work
called autfarane (Peters 6, 399 ) which is identical with No. 399 of
1895-98 in the Govt. MSS Library at the B. (). R. Institute, Poona.
The identity of this 71903 with the author of the Rasasanketakalikā
will be examined in a separate note. Aufrecht also records ( Part III,
130 ) a work on jyotișa called ali fazani but its author is not mentioned.
It appears to be a different work from the quaren of Jus referred
to above.
2. This MS is dated Samvat 1689 ( = A.D. 1633). It was
copied at Ajmere and contains two impressions of a seal on the last
folio. The seals are in Persian script. Mr. G. H. Khare of the
Bharata Itihasa Mandal has given me a tentative deciphering of these
seal-impressions, according to which the Seal contains the words
"Keśav Ibn Ganesh Kher." If this reading is correct it would mean
that the Seal belongs to some owner of the MS subsequent to the date
of the Copy viz. A. D. 1633. Keshav Ganesh Kher is a Maharashtra
Brahmin name while the copy was made at Ajmere in Rajputana and
the MS was acquired by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar from Gujarat.

The above matter common to both the works proves beyond
doubt the identity of authorship especially in view of the identitv
of names of the authors referred to already. In spite of the
common matter the relative chronology of tlie two works cannot be
determined unless either of the two works is found mentioning the
other work by name.
The work Rasasauketakalikā composed, therefore, during the
reign of King Rājamalla of Mewad ( 147-4-1509 1. D.) is very
important as pointed out by Vaidya Jadavaji Trikamji Acharya in
his Preface. Among the severil rasas mentioned in this manual we
find one called “क्रव्यादरस'' prescribed against the lethargic condi-
tion of the bowels and want of appetite ( agnimānd ya). Verses 67

its marvellous effects and miraculous properties :-

The above extract gives us an impression that ancient Indian
kings were addicted to over-eating and required special medicines
to enable them to digest everything they swallowed." "अग्निविवृद्धि"
or stimulation of appetite was more a matter of concern for the
well-fed kings than for the famished peasants. Verily this
miserable condition of the kings afforded a nice opportunity for the
ancient physicians to make a fortune and hence in verse 77 of the
above extract we get an anecdote about King ACOT who is stated to
have been 'भूरिभोज्यप्रिय ', excessively fond of eating or rather a
glutton. A physician by name भैरवानन्द administered the व्यादरस to
this King and the King was so much pleased by its marvellous
effects that he gave the physician no less than eight villages as a
reward.
Students of history proper may perhaps be able to verify the
above anecdote and its historical content. The anecdote is amus-
ing enough as it is cited by Kāyastha Câmunda as an illustration
from history to prove his point contained in the line: "अतः संसेव्यते
भूपैर्महदग्निविवद्धये।" i.e. the क्रव्यादरस should be taken by kings to
effect a good appetite.

( = f ) ( A. D. 1210 )“ who invaded Gujarat and other countries
and established a short-lived kingdom almost rivalling in extent the
realms of the Chālukyas and Rāslitrakūtas.” Inscriptional
references to this Singlana describe him as under :
" अस्ति ध्वस्तसमस्तवैरिविसरप्रौढप्रतापानलः
कुंदश्वेतदिगंतकीर्तिरमलः श्रीसिंघणः क्षोणिपः ।
येनाहारि हरीभसंभृतमतिस्फीतं समस्तं क्षणा-

Singhaņa ruled from Saka 1132 ( = A. 1). 1210 ) to Saka 1169
(= A. D. 1247)2i.e. for a period of 37 years. Whether he gave any
village to any physician of the name of haar as stated in the
Rasasariketakalikā of Kāyastha Cāmunda is a matter for investigation.
That he did entertain court physicians is proved by the fact of one
of the inscriptions mentioned above being composed by an eminent
physician who was at the same time noted for his poetic talents.
The name of this poet physician was Mādhava, son of Dhaneśvara-
bhatta of the Vişnuvrddha gotra and belonging to the Taittiriya
Sākhā. The pertinent verse supplying this information reads as
follows ::.-

In inscriptiops, devoted more 10 the praise of kings tion to

of the prowess of King Singhana in his invasion of Gujarat is given,
burno reference to his personal habits could be traced in such

poetic descriptions. Besides there are two more namesakes of
king Singhaņa. One of these was called Simharāja or King Simha,
though his full name was Singhaņa. He was probably the
brother of Parammadeva, the successor of Seuņa Candra ( 1069
A. D.) of the early Yadava Dynasty.' The other namesake of
King Singhaņa is Singhaṇadevathe last prince of the Kalacuri
Dynasty whose grant dated Saka 1105 ( = A.D. 1183 ) was brought to
notice by Dr. Fleet in 1875 and published in the Indian Antiquary.
Singhaṇadeva was the brother of King Soma. It was at the instance
of a woman that King Soma made a grant in the year Saka 1096
( = A. D. 1174 ). Her name was Sāvaladevi, who is represented to
have been dearer to the King than his own wife. “Her brother
was Bhairava by name who had exercised himself on the musical
instruments especially on the Brahmavīņā and was skilled in beat-
ing time." 3 Bhairava and his sister Savaladevi had, therefore,
great influence at the court of King Soma of the Kalacuri dynasty,
the brother of Singhaṇadeva. Is it possible to suggest that this
Bhairava had anything to do with Bhairavānanda of the Rasasanketa-
kalika, who administered क्रव्यादरस to सिंहण क्षोणिप and got eight
villages as a reward ?
The above anecdote about the fondness of king Simhaņa for
excessive eating ( TTHGUINEA ) reminds me of a similar tradition
current in the Maratha country about Peshwa Bajirao II. Whatever
be the truth of this tradition with regard to this last of the Peshwas
and his personal habits the fact remains that he was instrumental in
indirectly encouraging gluttony to a certain extent. Making due
allowance for the charitable motives which prompted him to feed
the Brahmins on an enormous scale and pay them dakşiņās in addi-
tion we are constrained to admit that the system engendered in-
dolence instead of encouraging learning, which was the original
object of the system.
It appears that the system of feeding Brahmins on a grand

scale and paying them dakşiņās began early in the Peshwa period.
For instance, in an entry in the Peshwa's' Diaries for 28th July 1736
we read the following entry :-
“ Panta Pradhan performed the ceremony of feeding the
Brahmins from Srāvaņa Suddha Pratipada. On the Nägapañcami
day dakşiņā was distributed at the rate of 1 to 2 rupees per head.
4000 to 5000 Brahmins had gathered for the purpose. ”
Now compare with the above acccount the following account
of a similar feast to the Brahmins given by Bajirao II at the close of
the Peshwa Period :-
“ The ceremony in the month of Srāvana ( was duly cele.
brated ) and dakşiņā was distributed as usual ( to Brahmins). This
year the number of Brahmins was less by ten to twelve thousand.
Khicați was served for five days as in the previous years. On
Monday at 17 ghaţikās in the day ( at about 2 P. M.) the distribu-
tion of dakşiņā to the Brahmins assembled began. Owing to some
showers of rain on that day the Brahmins did not attend the feast
in large numbers. On the following day it was arranged that
dakṣiṇā should be distributed simultaneously at all the four gates.
This arrangement resulted in the admission of the entire number of
Brāhmins inside (the enclosure). Shrimant Rājasri Dādā
( = Raghunathrao Kurundvadkar ) had been appointed as one of the
distributors of dakșiņā and he worked in that capacity. On Tues-
day afternoon Sindia ( = Mahadji Sindia ) was personally present at
the ceremony. On that occasion he distributed rupees in handfuls
to certain meritorious or austere Brahmins from Poona. (Out of
this number ) some ten to twelve persons received as dakşiņā Rs.
800, 400, 150, 200, each and so on. The total number of Brahmins
recorded at the four gates (of the enclosure) was 32,231. Total
amount of money distributed was Rs. 1, 13, 281. Three Brahmins
of weak constitution expired on this occasion."2
It would, therefore, appear that the modest number of 4000 to
5000 of Brahmins fed in A. D. 1736 had increased to more than

by Camunda. This MS is identical with No. 399 of 1895-98 in the
Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona, and consists of
2 foliis only. It appears to be a vocabulary of tāntric terms. It
begins as follows:
1. Vide remarks of Dr. Sen in his Administrative System of the
Marathas, Calcutta, 1925, p. 471- Originally the Dakshina System
was instituted by Dabhades but was continued by the Peshwas after
the fall of that family. It was originally meant for scholars but was
extended to Brahmins in general. "Bajirao II spent about 4 lacs
of rupees annually in Dakshina grants.” Mr. Elphinstone main-
tained a Pathashala at Poona out of the Dakshana grant.
Feeding of Brahimins to their heart's content and giving them
cakşiņas at religious sacrifices was practised in the Peshwa period.
Raja Savai Jaisingh of Jaipur ( 1699 - 1743 A. 1). ) who performed an
Ašvamedha Sacrifice gave plenty of dakşiņās and feasts to Brahmins
on that occasion. The following verses from 1śvara Vilasa Kāvya,
a poem dealing with the Jaipur dynasty describes this sacrifice in
chapters IV and l of the same. In chapter V we get the following
verses ---
" SETT Para gratia I.

date of the TARD I cannot be determined. However, we are
sure that it was composed during the reign of King Rājamalla of

नायकं पशुपति" showing thereby that Kayastha Camunda was a
devotee of God Siva. His father's name as recorded in the Varnani-
ghanta (verse 1, line 3) was Kumbha (श्रीमान्कुंभनन्दवः). In the
Juaratimirabhāskara also he is called 79: in the following
verse :---
"देसे श्रीमेदपाटे रसयुगसरभूमानवर्षे दसम्यां
शुक्लायामश्विनस्य त्रिदसगुरुदिने योगिनीपत्र(त्त? नस्थः ।
भूपे श्रीराजमल्ले निवसति वसुधामंडले कुंभसूनुः ।

The above verse occurs in MS No. 920 of 1884-87. In the
Bikaner MS of the f varatimirabhaskara instead of "कुंभसूनुः" in the
1. Anals ( B.O. R. I.) Vol. XII, p. 294-96.

70. Date of the Vişnubhaktikalpalatā of
Purușottama – Before A. D. 1495 1
No attempt has hitherto been made to put definite limits to the
chronology of the Vişnubhaktikalpalatā' of Puruşottama, though this
poem was published about 48 years ago. In a note on the author of
this poem in 8 Stabakas the editors state that the time and place of
this author is doubtful.?
In view of the above statement I propose to record in this
paper some data which will enable us to put some definite limits to
the date of Purusottama.
Aufrecht records some MSS of the l'işņubhaktikalpalată as
follows:-
| Adyar Library Bulletin, February 1941, pp. 13-16.
1. Kāvyamālā No. 31 (N. S. Press, Rombay, 1892) Ed. hy
Durgāprasād and Parah.
2. Ibid — “ TE 11974: 1 Aral-Fatros4517haritaTYFFHT favorafiti-
कल्पलताप्रणेता पुरुषोत्तमकविः कस्मिन्काले कतमं जनपदमलंचकारेति संदिग्धम"
The editors then refer to several theories about the chronology and
identification of Puruşottama as follows ----
(1) Anandarāmu on p. 14 of his Intro. to 5197 states that
Purusottama belonged to 7 or Bengal and was descended from
Est1903). He flourished not later than the latter part of the 12th
century A. 1).
(2) Klavi Caritra ( in Marăthi) tells us that Puruşottama was
the King of Orissa and Kalinga and Aourished in the 14th Century of
the Sālivāhana Saka. His Capital was at Cuttack. He composed
floghi, art and Aa14.
(3) Rajendralal Mitra states in his Notices of Sanskrit MSS
that Purusottama flourished either in the 10th or 11th Century A.D.
The editors observe that whereas the author of Fatosto and
other works is called TE919ğa at the end of these works, our
author's name as mentioned in the Taoruit gaat is given as geoH
only.

The above entries show that the work Vişnubhaktikalpalatā
( = VBK) has found three commentators. Of these three the
dates of two are definitely known as A. D. 1590 and 1621. We
inust, therefore, search for the date of VBK before A. D. 1590,
which is the later limit for the date of this work. Let us now see if
we can take this limit backwards from A. D. 1590. Fortunately for
1. The correct date is Sarivat 1054 = A. D. 1598.
2. MS No. 86 of 1883-8.1 in the B. (). R. Institute MSS

The chronogram 3727, igra, 270, H = Samvat 1647 = A. D.

The MS of the work is dated Samvat 1667 = Śaka 1533 = A. D.
1611. This MS, therefore, was copied 20 years after the work was
composed. Aufrecht's date A. D. 1621 is wrong.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
us we have a dated MS of the text of the VBK in the India Office
Library which was copied in A. D. 1495' and hence is earlier by 103
years than A. D. 1598 ( = Sam. 1654 ) which is the exact date of
Mahid hara's commentary Prakāsa on the VBK. We inust, there-
fore, search for Purușottama's date before A. D. 1495. Maheśvara's
commentary on the VBK was composed in A. D. 1591 and not in
A. D. 1621 as stated by Aufrecht' (CC I, 591 ).
The above data show the following chronology of the Mss of
the VBK and also of the commentaries on the work :
A. D. 1495 - Date of India Office MS of VBK.
1591 -- Maheśvara composed his comm. on VBK.
1598 – Mahidhara comments on VBK.
1611 —— Date of a MS Maheśvara's Comm. on VBK.
These dates enable us to conclude that Puruşottama lived

tional effusions on the names and qualities of Vişņu by Puruşottama,

FIIEIT GETIAA: 1 favouritcai që gat të Farsfer: 11" The 2nd MS of
VBK ( 10 No. 3909 ) dated Samvat 1848 = A. D. 1792. The third
MS (No. 3910) is dated “about A. D. 1650” and ends as fol-
lows :--- "gra si nu HiiTietosaterapi FETETETT ATHI&A: F797: 11

The chronogram wita (4) amor (5) TH (6) FI (1) = Samvat
1654 = A. D. 1598.
2. Aufrecht records A. D. 1590 as the date of Mahidhara's
Prakāśa Comm. but this statement is incorrect as, the exact date of
this Comm. is Sam. 1654 = A. D. 1598 and not A. D. 1590, which is
the date of Mahidhara's another work Mantramahodadhi (Saṁ.
1645).
3. Aufrecht's date A. D. 1621 for the composition Maheśvara's
Comm. on the VBK is directly contradicted by the date of Ms
No. 86 of 1883–84 which was copied in A. D. 1611 i. e. ten years
earlier before the work was composed (in A. D. 1621 according to
Aufrecht.)

before --- Say A. D. 1450 — and therefore we must try to make a
search for his date in sources of prior date i.e., before A. D. 1450.
The earlier terminus to the date of the VBK will liave to be
fixed on the strength of internal evidence. Unfortunately the
nature of this devotional poem calls for no references by the author
to earlier authors or works and consequently the task of fixing the
earlier limit becomes rather difficult. Whether and to what extent
Purusottama's present poem in 8 Stabakas was influenced by earlier
Vaişņavite works, I cannot say at present. I have not also traced
any references to the VBK in later Vaisnavite or other works.
There are some Vaisnavite works with titles analogous' to the
Vişnubhaktikal palatā but their priority or posteriority to the present
work will have to be examined separately before anything could be
definitely said in this matter.

71. The Kāmasamūha of Ananta, a Nāgara
Brahmin, Composed in A. D. 1457 |
Aufrecht' makes the following entry in his Catalogue regarding
a work called ' Kāmasamüha':-
"TAK alamk. Composed in 14572 by Ananta, JO 396. Oxf.
218a. B. 346. Peters. 3. 22a. 366. 394. D. 6.” This work Kāmasa-
müha contains verses illustrative of amatory sentiments composed
by Ananta, son of Bhişagvarya Hiramantrimandana. That Ananta
belonged to PATHETIT and his father's name was FOGT can be seen
from the following verse on folio 1 of MS No. 15 of 1869-70 in the
Govt. MSS Library at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona :--
Follrnal of Orienta! Research ( Madras !, Vol. XVI, Part 1,
pp. 74-81.
1. Cata. Catalogorum I, p. 93.
2. This date of composition is recorded in the India Office
MS No. 396 ( Vide I. (). Cata. Part II, p. 364a ). The chronogram
recording the date is found in the following verse :-
"fa 11 131731419 Tongyari (1)
27, i jai i ".
The work was composed in Savival 1514 in the month of
Caitra, Sukla paksa, 1.fth tithi, Bhrguvāra ( Sukravāra ) which cor-
responds to Friday, 13th April 1457 A. D. Vide Indian Ephemeris
Vol. V, p. 116). The expression = 14 and not 41 as interpret-
ed by Eggeling. Hence 99T + 7 = 1514 and not 1541
Samvat.
M, M. Haraprasad Sastri describes a MS of Kámasamūha in his
Des. Cata. of MSS (A. S. B. ) Vol. VI 1931, p. 434. This MS is
very scarly completc. M. M. Sastri states that the author is Ananta
the son of त्रिमा इन with this title " भिषङमुकुटालङ्कारहार." The correct
name of Antanta's father is Anson and not asa, as clearly stated
by him in versc_78 -- "*7897 7 ra: " (folio 6 of B. 0. R. 1. MS
No. 15 of 1869-70). Obviously Sastri's statement is based on a wrong
copy of the name in the MS before him.

"भाभल्लवंशजातेन मन्त्रिमण्डनसूनुना ।
अनन्तेन महाकाव्यप्रबन्धः क्रियते मया ॥ ६ ॥"
It is not recorded in the work what office of a minister (मन्त्रि)
was graced by #7sa and under what ruling prince he worked in that
capacity. It appears that fogn was the son of 777ram as we are told
on folio 5 in the following verse :---
" विद्वज्जनसभानन्दा (दो) मन्त्री नारायणात्मजः ।
मण्डनस्तस्य पुत्रेण वर्ण्यन्ते स्मतवोऽधुना ।। ६९ ॥"
On folio 6 our author calls himself सकलशास्त्रज्ञ in the following
verse:--
"मण्डनतनयोऽनन्तो मन्मथरूपः सकलशास्त्रज्ञः ।
अभिमतदाता रचयति रूपं बालाव्यवस्थाया: ।। ७८ ॥"
On folio 8 we find the following verse containing a reference to
nose-ornament' repeated verbatim from earlier anthologies :-
“ सुधामयोऽपि क्षयरोगशान्त्यै नासाग्रमुक्ताफलकरछलेन ।
अनङ्गसञ्जीवनदृष्टशक्तिमुखामृतं ते पिबतीव चन्द्रः ॥ १५ ॥"
The following verse beside its rhetorical implication shows
that lamps used in India had no lamp covers to protect them from
wind :-
Folio 10 -“दीपो वातभयात्तन्व्या वस्त्राञ्चलतिरोहितः।
विलोक्य कुचसौन्दर्य मकरः कम्पते शिरः ॥ ५४॥"
We have already pointed out that attra was the grand father of
अनन्त and father of मण्डन. This information is corroborated by the
following verse on fol. 21 :---
"नारायणात्मजः श्रीमान् मन्त्रिश्रीमण्डनो द्विजः ।
तत्सुतेन प्रियावस्था प्रयाणे वर्णिता मुदा ॥ ६॥"
- 1. Vide my article on the Antiquity of the Hindoo Nose-Ornament-
Annals, XIX, 313-334. The verse “सुधामयोऽपि etc.' is found in the
Saktimuktavali of Jalhana composed in A. D. 1258 and in Sariga-
dharapaddhati ( A. D. 1363).
2. I propose to prepare in due course a paper on references to
lamps in Indian literature.

As para composed the FIRE in A. D. 1457" we may assign
the following chronology to his father and grandfather :-
artrool (C. 1400 A. D. ) - son Anga (C..1430 A. D.) - son paras
(A. D. 1457 ). 377777 belonged to the 77775 as stated by him on
folio 41:-

The place of Ananta's residence viz. "STEFA7777” mention-
ed by him in the above verse may be identical with Ahmedabad
1. The Ms“ B. 3. 46" of Kāmasamūha mentioned by Aufrecht is
dated Samvat 1619 = A.D. 1563 and was in the possession of HTCFOTOT-
315 of Ahmedabad (Vide pp. 46 -- 47 of of Bühler's Cata. of Gujarat
etc. MSS, Fasci. I, Bombay, 1872). On p. 2 of Fasci. I Bühler
observes " If no remark is added the era in whieh the MSS are dated
is Samvat.” In view of this remark the year 1619 given as the age
of the MS of Kāmasamüla on p. 47 of Faci. III is a Sanivat year.
2. According to the Bombay Gazetteer Vol. I, pt. 1 ( 1896 ) which
deals with the history of Gujarat, Ahmad I ( 1411 - 1441 A. D.) of
Gujarat built Ahmedabad in A. D. 1413. As pateid belonged to the
arti caste, the town “ TIEFAATÁgai " must be identical with the
modern Ahmadabad in Gujarat which is generally the home of the
Nāgara Brahmins. If this identification is accepted the 7JATIZ
appears to have been composed at Ahmedabad 44 years after the
founding of Ahmedabad in A. D. 1413. 3797778 appears to refer to the
foundation of Ahmedabad as a contemporary event of fresh occur.

Ahmad I of Gujarat also built a town of the name Ahmadnagar
(Himatnagar the modern capital of Idar state) in A. D. 1427 ( Vide
p. 83 of History of Gujarat hy Commissariat, 1938 ). It is also possible
that 3178 may have been tbe resident of this “ 3 HATTT” (Himat-
nagar). If this identification is accepted the FTAAR was written
30 years after the foundation of Ahmednagar.

(founded A. D. 1413 ) or Ahmadnagar ( Himmatnagar'), the capital
of Idar State (founded A. D. 1427), both of which were founded
by Ahmad I of Gujarat. It is not possible to identify “BERG-
77877'' with modern Ahmadnagar( founded by Ahmad Nizam Shah
in A.D. 1494 ) as such identification would result in an
anachronism.
In the following verse on folio 3 we get the name of Ananta's

1. Vide Archaeological Finds in Idar State, llimmatnagar,
1936, p. 7 - Flimmatnagar is 55 miles north of Ahmedabad. It was
founded in 1426. ( The Bombay Gazetteer gives A. D. 1427 as the
year of its foundation ); P. 38 — " History of Idar State attests that
the Nagir Brahmins and Banias formed a large percentage of the
population of the Sate in the olden times. It seems when Grahā-
ditya, son of Shilāditya, the last king of Mallabhipur, came in pos-
session of Idar State in the 7th century, he brought with him from
Vadnagar, many Nagir families out of gratitude to his foster-mother
the Nagir lady Kamalavati. They held responsible posts in the
administration and spread all over the State. Many Shivá-pan-
chāyatan temples and step-wells in the State are said to have been
built by them. The Nāgirs left the State in large numbers in the
17th century when there was a great exodus on account of the
tyranny of Rao Jagannāth.” (If the above evidence is correct the
home of Nāgara Brahman Ananta and his family must be Himmat.

STUDIES IN INDIAN LITERARY HISTORY
The account of our author of the FIFA as gathered from the
toregoing analysis would be as follows:-
____ अनन्त, the author of कामसमूह, belonged to भाभल्लवंश. He was a
-77777 Brāhinin. His grandfather's name was 1770. His father
was "gét, who is styled as #fa or minister. FOC# is also called a
court-physician (garai rapaz: ) who was proficient in veterinary
science - गजायुर्वेदवेत्ता) and was another धन्वन्तरि or physician of gods.
377ra twice calls himself 77ra, resident of a town founded by
BETA. This town may be either Ahmedabad founded by Ahmad
I of Gujarat in A. D. 1414 or it may be identical with Ahmadnagar
(Himmatnagar, Capital of the Idar State) founded by the same
king in A.D. 1427. The FTATE, composed by 3ra (in his old age )
in A. D. 1457 ( Friday, the 13th April) is an anthology bearing on
Kāmasastra and its several topics. 379-a refers to his guru 37701
only once in the कामसमूह. This आनन्दपूणे may be identical with
आनन्दपूर्ण alias विद्यासागर the commentator of the Mahabharata and
writer of some Vedānta works, who was a contemporary of Kāma-
deva, the Kadamba ruler of Goa (c. 1393 A. D.). Evidently wara
may have been a junior contemporary of आनन्दपूर्ण or विद्यासागर, if
iny identification of his guru 319-gqui, as suggested by me is proved
on independent evidence. Like his father who was an eminent
court-physician, Fat was also proficient in the science of medicine
as he calls himself" faofaa ."
As the F1457E is avowedly an anthology bearing on Kāmaśāstra
it would be interesting to trace some of his verses to their original
sources. This work, however, has been made difficult by the
author himself, who makes no mention of the sources from which
he has borrowed. He only makes general statements about his
borrowing, such as:
___“ग्रन्थानालोक्य सर्वशः ", "बहूनि शास्त्राणि विलोक्य भव्यान् । संगृह्य पद्यान
qafa guitara 1 "
It appears that tra has mixed up his own composition with
that of previous writers.
I have not studied the question of references to the FTHAHET in
later literature but shall note here one reference of A. D. 1787, in
which year a copy of the FTHAT was prepared in Poona at some
cost as stated in a recent book' dealing with the Peshwa period.
1. Qa155 7T 19ia by N. G. Chapekar, Poona, 1937, p. 293 -- Saka
1709 = A.D. 1787. Mr. Chapekar refers to the India Office MS mention-
ed by me already in this paper. He is not, however, aware of the
2 MSS of the work at the B. O. R. Institute in the Govt. Mss Library
vix. No. 15 of 1869-70 and No. 283 of 1884-86, as also the Calcutta
MS of the work described by Haraprasad Shastri (p. 434 of R. A. S.
B. MSS. Cata. Vol. VI, 1931 ).
