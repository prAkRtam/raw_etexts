General Editor's Foreword
emory of the u Singhji Sinoni which is being
It is with great pleasure that I present to the scholarly world
Dr. Bhogilal J. Sandesara's learned work entitled 'Literary Circle of Mahā-
mātya Vastupāla and its contribution to Sanskrit Literature' which is being
published as the third volume of Shri Bahādur Singhji Singhi Memorial Series
established in the sacred memory of the Late Bābu Shri Bahadur Singhjī
Singhi, the founder of the Singhi Jain Series.
On the 7th July, 1944, Shrī Bahādur Singhji Singhi of memorable
name left his mortal coils. To perpetuate his sacred memory was published
under my editorship the ag E FECT Per faring in the form of a bulky
issue of the raita faen a Hindi-Gujarati Research Quarterly, presenting
a collection of highly valuable contributions from numerous scholars. There-
with was also included an extensive essay by me giving my cherished
reminiscences of Singhījī. At the time of issuing that memorial volume,
it occurred to me that to commemorate the name of the late Singhīji such
a memorial volume should be published every year. Accordingly a special
yearly number of the Bhāratīya Vidyā, a research journal in English
published by the Bhāratīya Vidyā Bhavan was issued as the Bābu Shrī
Bahādursinghji Singhĩ Memorial Volume. It proved to be a rich and
valuable collection of important research papers. But because of some
unfavourable circumstances, my decision of publishing a memorial yolume
yearly in the sacred memory of Singhīji could not be regularly given effect
to in the immediately following years, though my efforts in that connection
were continued. And before the present work was taken up for publication,
I undertook in 1946-47 to publish in the present series the two volumes of
'Studies in Indian Literary History', presenting a collection of valuable
articles of my learned friend Prof. P. K. Gode, But as an aftermath of
the large-scale destruction and loss that resulted from the Second World
War, paper, etc. became very scarce, so that the printing of these volumes of
Prof. Gode could not be carried on according to schedule, and it has not
yet been possible to place them before the reading public.
In the meanwhile printing of the present work was completed, and
I experience satisfaction to some degree in presenting it to the learned world.
Today is the ninth anniversary of the passing away of that great soul
to commemorate whose name the present memorial series is started. And
the fact that on this very day it has been possible to publish such a rich
volume of the memorial series will, I hope, be a matter of gratification to the
admirers and lovers of the Singhi Jain Series. I also hope that further within
a few months it will be possible to make available to scholars the above-
mentioned two important volumes together of Prof. Gode's writings too.

GENERAL EDITOR'S POREWORD
The author of the present monograph, Dr. Bhogilal J. Sandesara is
a deep and well-advanced student of his subject. He has studied as well as
taught the subject of Gujarati language, culture and ancient history with
earnestness and enthusiasm. I personally know him since many years - since
even when he had not yet passed his school final. At that time being
impressed by his insatiable urge to learn-and especially to know and
understand everything about the ancient cultural glory of Gujarat, I had also
an occasion to say to him a few words of encouragement. Being a native of
Pāțaņ which remained for centuries the greatest centre of culture and
prosperity, and which is even at present quite famous for having preserved
the literary treasures of Gujarat, it was but natural for Dr. Sandesara to draw
ever-fresh inspiration for the study of subjects, clear to him. The famous
Jain Bhaņdārs at Pāta» harbouring thousands of Sanskrit and Prakrit Mss.
and hundreds of Old Gujarati works belonging right down to the eighteenth
century would prove a effective source of inspiration to any one sufficiently
curious and deligent. In my case too, for instance, it was Pāțan with its rich
and varied materials and sources relating to the past history, literature and
glory of Gujarat which principally induced me to study them, and enable me
by publishing them to make my humble contribution in the service of
literature. This very work of Dr. Sandesara is sufficient proof as to how
much valuable were these Mss. at Pāțan for his work of editing and research.
Had he not got any clear idea of the rich materials stored in the Pāțaņ
Bhandārs, and had he not got an apportunity of having access to them,
he would have not been able, as he has been, to substantiate his thesis
at various places with original, reliable and first-rate evidences, and thus makes
the work authentic and well written,
Concerning the life and good deeds of Vastupāla, the great and glorious
minister of Mahā-Gujarāt, there are numerous works in Sanskrit and Old
Gujarati, and on the basis of these a number of works, essays and articles have
appeared in Modern Gujarati, Hindi, English, German, etc. But among all
these writings the present work of Prof. Sandesara occupies a special place
on account of organized marshalling of facts and of authentic pictures of the
cultural and social conditions of the Gujarat of those times.
I offer my heart-felt congratulations to Prof. Sandesara for this work
done so well.
In fine I take this opportunity to express here my feeling of sincere
gratitude towards the University of Bombay which having taken into consi-
deracion the high worth of the present work, has shown generousness in
granting a substantial sum towards the cost of its publication.
7th of July, 1953.

SHRI BAHADUR SINGHJI SINGHI
02
By
Acharya Jina Vijaya Muni
THE 7th OF JULY, is a sorrowful day for me. This day in the year
1944, Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji Singhi left his mortal coils at the compara-
tively early age of fiftynine. His loss has been widely felt. His aged
mother received this rude shock so ill that she did not long outlive him. His
worthy sons have lost an affectionate and noble father, the industrialists and
businessmen of the country one of their pioneers, the large number of his
employees a benevolent master, scholarship one of its best patrons and the
poor people of his native district a most generous donor. To me his loss has
been personal. My contact with him was a turning point in my life. Whatever
I have been able, during the past fifteen years, to achieve in the field of scho-
larship is: due directly to him. The financial assistance with which he backed
up my activities was the least of his contributions. But for his love of scholar-
ship with which he inspired me, this chapter of my life would have been
entirely different. To his sacred memory I am penning these few lines. This
volume, is brought out in his memory.
Babu Shri Bahadur Singhji was born in Azimganj, Murshidabad, in
Vikram Samvat 1941, in the ancient family of the Singhis, who were of old
the treasurers of the Mughal emperors. The family had passed through many
vicissitudes of fortune and in the 17th century, it migrated from Rajaputana to
Bengal, but thanks to the energy and enterprise of Singhiji's father, Babu
Dalchandji Singhi, the family firm became a very flourishing concem.
At an early age Singhiji joined the family business and by pushing
ahead with father's enterprises, succeeded in making the firm the foremost in
the mining industry of Bengal and Central India. Besides he also acquired
vast zamindaries and had interests in many industrial and banking concerns.
This early preoccupation with business affairs prevented his having a college
education. But Singhiji was studious and introspective by nature. Unlike many
other wealthy men who spend their money and time in such fads as the races,
the theatres, and the like, he devoted all his spare time to study and cultural
development. He acquired an excellent command over several languages, Art
and literature were the subjects of his choice. He was very fond of collecting
rare and invaluable specimens of ancient sculpture, paintings, coins, copperpla-
tes and inscriptions. His manuscript collection contained a large number of
fare works of historical and cultural importance, among which mention must be
made of a unique manuscript of the Koran which was handed down from
Baber to Aurangzeb and bears the autographs of all.of them. It is recorded
therein that it was considered by them all as more valuable than the empire.

SHRI BAHADUR SINGHJI SINGHI
His numismatic collection, especially of Kushan and Gupta coins, is consi-
dered the third best in the world. He also had a good and large collection
of works of art and historical importance. Singhiji was a Fellow of the Royal
Society of Arts (London), a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal,
the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, the Indian Research Institute and a Founder-
Member of the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. He was also the President of the
Jain Swetambara Conference held in Bombay 1926. Though he had made
no special study of law he was well up in the legal matters. On one occa-
sion when he found that his lawyers were nor properly representing his case
he himself pleaded out the case succesfully, much to the surprise of the bench
and the bar who took him for an accomplished advocate.
Though a highly religious and leading figure in the Jain Community
he had an outlook which was far from sectarian. More than three-fourths of
the six lakhs and over of his donations were for non-jain causes. More often
than not he preferred to give his assistance anonymously and he did not keep
a list of his donations even when they were made in his name, To the
Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Calcutta, he gave Rs. 10,000/-, when Mahatmaji had
been to his place for the collection of funds; to the Hindu Accademy,
Daultapur, Rs. 15,000.-, to the Taraqi-Urdu Bangala 5000/-, the Hindi
Sahitya Parishad 12,500/-, to the Vishuddhanand Sarasvati Marwari Hospital
10,000/-, to several maternity homes 2,5001-, to the-Benares Hindu University
2,500/-, to the Jiaganj High School. 5,000/-, to the Jiaganj London Mission:
Hospital 6000/-, to the Jain Temples at Calcutta' and Murshidabad 11,0001-
to the Jain Dharma Pracharak Sabha, Manbhum 5,000/-, to the Jain Bhavan,
Calcutta, 15,000/-, to the Jain Pustak Prachar Mandal, Agra, 7,500/-, to the
Agra Jain Temple 3,500/-, to the Ambala Jain High School, 2,1001-, for the
Prakrit Kosh 2,500l, and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan 10,000/-. At the
Singhi Park Mela held at his Ballyganj, residence in which Viscount Wavell,
then Commander-in-Chief and Lord John Herbert, Governor of Bengal and
Lady Herbert participated, he donated Rs. 41,000l-, for the Red Cross Fund.
: The people of the district of Murshidabad, his native place, will.ever
remain grateful to him for having distributed several thousand maunds of rice
at the low price of Rs. 81- when rice was selling at Rs. 24- in those terrible
years of 1942-52, himself thereby suffering a loss of over three lakḥs".In.
May-June 1944 he again spent Rs. 50 000 - for the distribution of cloth, rice,
and coins for the people of that place.
My close association with Singhiji began in 1931, when he invited
me to occupy the Chair for Jain Studies which he was starting at the
Vishvabharati. Due to unfavourable climatic conditions of Shantiniketan I.
could not continue to work there for more than four years, but during those
years was founded the Singhi Jain Series. During the period of ten years.
of my principalship of Gujarat Puratattva Mandir, Ahmedabad, and even
before that I had been collecting materials of historical and philological.
importance and folk-lore etc. which had been lying hidden in the great Jain
Bhandars of Patan, Ahmedabad, Batoda etc. I persuaded Singhiji to start

was spaust informatios. But he Sished and is only desitione. In Ma
a- series which would publish works dealing with the vast materials in my
possession, and also other important Jain texts and studies prepared on
the most modern scientific lines. On the works of the Series he spent
through me more than Rs. 75,000/-. During this long period of over a dozen
years he not even once asked me as to how and for what works the amount
was spent. Whenever the account was submitted he did not ask for even
the least information, but sanctioned it casting merely a formal glance on
the accounts sheets. But he showed the most discriminating interest in
the matter that was being published and on the material and manner in
which they were being brought out. His only desire was to see the
publication of as many works as possible during his lifetime. In May 1943
at my, instance he gave over the Series to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,
In September 1943. I had been to Calcutta to negotiate the purchase, for the
Bhavan, of a well-equipped library of a retired professor, Sihghiji casually
asked me what arrangements had been made for meeting the cost. I prom-
ptly replied that there was no cause for worry as long as donors like himself
were there. He smiled; he had decided. Eventually he pursuaded me to
go in for the Nahar Collection which was a still more valuable one. He did
not live long enough to present this literary treasure to the Bhavan; but his
eldest son and my beloved friend, Babu Shri Rajendra Singh has fulfilled his
father's wish though he was totally ignorant of it and has got this unique
collection for the Bhavan and spent Rs. 50,000/- for the purpose.
By the end of 1943 his health began to decline. In the first week of
January, 1944, when I went to him at Calcutta in connection with the work of
the Bharatiya Itihasa Samiti I found him extremely unwell. Notwithstanding
his ill-health he talked to me for more than a couple of hours on the day of
my arrival there. The first thing he said in the course of this lengthy, though
very sweet talk, was to give me a mild reproof for undertaking the long and
tedious journeys to Calcutta, Benaras and Cawnpore in spite of my ill health.
He discussed with absorbing interest the details of the Samiti's proposed
History of India, a subject of great interest to him. Our talks then drifted to
the subject of the History of Jainism in which connection also he expressed
his opinion about the material to be utilised for such a work. At the termi-
nation of our talks, which this time lasted for over three hours, I found him
much exhausted and drooping in spirits.
On the 7th January his health took a turn for the worse. On Iith
January I went to take leave of him, which he, full of emotion, gave with a
heavy heart, exclaiming "Who knows whether we shall meet again or not ?"
I requested him to take heart and remain buoyant. He would be soon
restored to normal health. But while I was stepping out of his room, my
eyes were full of tears and his last words began to eat into my heart. Ill-luck
prevented our second meeting. That lofty and generous soul finally left its
mortal habitat at mid-day on 7th July, 1944. May his soul rest in peace !
His sons, Babu Rajendra Singh, Babu Narendra Singh and Babu
Virendra Singh are treading in the footsteps of their reçered father, Euring

the past year on the Singhi Series alone they have spent over Rs. 20,000/-,
I have already mentioned how Babu Rajendra Singh purchased for the Bhavan
the valuable Nabar collection. Babu Narendra Singh has also spent Rs.
30,000.- for a foundation of a Jain Bhavan at Calcutta. Babu Rajendra Singh
and Babu Narendra Singh have also very generously promised me to continue
to meet all the expenses of the Singhi Jain Series and requested me to
bring out as many works as possible, at whatever cost so that this unique
series founded and cherished by their late lamented father may continue to
bring to light the invaluable treasures of Jain literature and culture.
In recognition of his unique assistance the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan
has decided to perpetuate Singhiji's memory by naming its Indological
library after him. Further, one of its main halls will bear his name. The
Bhavan's Jain Department will also be known as the Siaghi Jain
Shikshapithet

PREFACE
MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPĀLA, the prime-minister of the Tāghelā
king of Dhavalakka or Dholkā in Gujarāt during the first half of the 13th
century A. D., was not only a prominent political figure of his times, but
also a great patron of literature and art, a great builder of monuments
and a man of letters. Under his patronage there flourished a literary
group whose activities made a notable contribution to mediaeval Sanskrit
literature in its various forms, both creative and Sāstric.
The life and works of Mahāmātya V-istupāla have attracted the atten-
tion of scholars for the last several decades. Prof. A. V. Kāthavate has
given a short sketch of Vastupāla’s life and works as early as 1883 in his
Introduction to the Kirtikaumudi of Someśvara published in the Bombay
Sanskrit Series (No. XXV) and Dr. Bübler dealt with the same topic
when he made a critical analysis of the contents of the Sukrtasamkirtana
of Arisimba in & paper published in 18892.
The Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. I, Pt. I ( History of Gujarāt), published
in 1896, devotes a chapter to the history of the Vāghelās, a few pages ( pp.
198–203 ) of which are given to the political career of Vastupāla. Divân
Bahādur Ranchhodbhāi Udayarām, the Gujarātī translator of Forbe's
Rāsmālā, added a supplement about the Vāghelās in the second edition of
his translation published in 1899 and collected therein many facts about
the personal history and political career of Vastupāla. The same subject
was discussed by Mr. Vallabhji Haridatta Acārya in his Introduction to
the versified Gujarātī translation of Someśvara's Kirtikaumudi publisher!
in 1908. Mr. Chimanlāl D. Dalal also dealt with it from various points
of view, very briefly of course, in his Introductions to the Naranārāya-
nānanda of Vastupāla, Vasantavilāsa of Bālacandra and Hammiramadamar-
dana of Jayasimhasūri, published in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series.
Recently, in 1939, Mr. Durgāshankar K. Shāstrī deroted, in the seconn
volume of his Gujarātī work, Gujarātano Madhyakālin Rājput Itihāsa,
a few pages ( pp. 381-395 ) to the life and works of Vastupāla, giving one
or two paragraphs ( pp. 394–95 ) to Vastupāla’s patronage of literature.
However, during the last five or six decades, after Kathavațe, Büh-
ler, Ranchhodbhāi and Ācārya wrote their essays, many important sources
-both literary and epigraphic -- kearing on the life and works of Vastupāla
have been discovered and several of his own compositions—a Mabākāvga
and four Stotras–have been unearthed from the old manuscript-libraries
at Pātau and other places. The historical and biographical details about
several figures in the literary circle of Vastupāla have become known and
1 The original German paper was published in the Sitzungsberichte of the
Imperial Academy of Vienna (Vol. CXIX, 1889) and an English translation
of the same-The Sukrtasamkirtana of Arisimba-vas printed in the Indian
Antiquary, Vol XXXI, pp. 477 ff.

their works are brought to light. Though a considerable part of these
literary productions is unprinted as yet and is available only in manuscript-
form they constitute important data for purposes of study.
Here I may state that the scholars mentioned above have dealt with
only some aspects of Vastupāla's life and that, none of them has treated
the subject as a whole and exhaustively and that in the matter of contri-
tution to Sanskrit literature by Vastupāla and his circle, there has been
only a very scanty discussion. Further, these scholars had no opportunity
to utilize all the new material discovered up to date. Thus there was scope
enough for an adequate treatment of Vastupāla's life and especially for a
critical account of his own and his circle's contribution to Sanskrit literature.
The present work is an attempt to study the topic critically from the
historical, the biographical and the literary points of view.
The work has been divided into three parts. The first part-viz.
Introductory-presents in brief the cultural and literary background and
deals with the past literary and scholastic traditions of Gujarāt with a view
to studying the life and works of Vastupāla and bis circle in their proper
perspective. The second part-viz. Mahāmātya Vastupāla and His Literary
Circle-deals with the personal and political history of Vastupāla and
studies critically Vastupāla's role as a great patron of literature and art
and a man of letters. Moreover, it tries to present all the available biogra-
phical details, in an authenticated form, about the known literary figures in
Vastuļāla's circle. Thus the first two parts of the book are devoted to the
study of the historical and biographical material.
The third part-viz. Contribution to Sanskrit Literature-makes a
critical survey of the contribution of Vastupāla and his circle to different
branches of literature. First, I have dealt with the creative forms of
literature, like Mabākāvya, Nātaka, Prasasti, Stotra, anthology, Dharma-
kathā, Prabandha, Apabhraíśa Rāsas etc., and then with the Šāstric forms,
like the works on poetics, grammar, metrics, Nyāya, astrology and com-
mentaries on Jaina religious works?. And at the end of the book, I have
added a Conclusion summarising the main currents of the whole treatment
While preparing the present work I have tried my best to consult
all the available sources, published or in manuscript-from in Sanskrit,
Prākrit, Apabhramśa and Old Gujarātī, and have also gone through all the
1 Section I of chapter VI (Historical Mahākāvgas ) and chapter VIII
(Praśastis ) etc. will be found to have some portions of the subject-matter
repeated to a certain extent. This was rather inevitable, because all the
four historical Mabākāvyas and all the Praśastis are sources of contemporary
history and at the same time they are literary compositions having Vastupāla
as their hero. In this work dealing with the history as well as literature of
mediaeval Gajarāt, I have utilized these for both the purposes, and hence while
analysing the plots of the historical poems etc. from the literary point of view
at least a few things had to be repeated.

known research-works pertaining to the subject in English, Hindi and
Gujarāti.
As considerable part of the literary sources pertaining to Vastupāla
and his circle of poets and scholars and to their compositions is not printed
as yet, I had to procure a large number of manuscripts-about forty in all-
written on palm-leaves and on paper for the purpose of this study. It was
through the good offices of Muni Śrī Punya vijayajī that I had free access to
the famous manuscript-libraries at Pātaḥ, and also at Baroda and Chāni, a
village near Baroda. Moreover, I had to consult several manuscripts from
Jaina Bbāndārs at Cambay, Ahmedabad and Chānasmā, and I am grateful
to the authorities of the Bhändārs for giving me facilities for work. I am
also thankful to Prof. P. K. Gode, Curator, Bhandarkar Oriental Research
Institute, Poona, for putting at my disposal some of the required manu-
scripts for a long time, and to Muni Śrī Kāntivijayaji for the loan of copies
of some unpublished works. I am indebted to Prof. K. V. Abhyankar,
Pandit Sukhlālji and Sri Jitendra Jetly, DI, A., Nyāyācārya, for useful
suggestions, to Prof. C. N. Patel, M. A., for going through the press-copy
and to Śrī Suresh H. Joshi, M.A., for preparing the Index.
The work was prepared when I was Professor of Gujarātī and Ardha-
māgadhī at the B. J. Institute of Learning and Research, Gujarat Vidyā
Sabhā, Ahmedabad, and I take this opportunity to express my deep sense
of gratitude to Prof. R. C. Parikh, Director of the Institute, for helping me
in a variety of ways in the prosecution of my research and also for the
invaluable facility of the Institute's very rich library. I also acknowledge
my indebtedness to the University of Bombay for the grant-in-aid received
by me from the University towards the cost of publication of this work.
Last but not the least, I heartily thank Ācārya Srī Jinavijayaji for
including this work for publication in the reputed Singhi Jaina Series,
Adhyapak Nivas,'

CHAPTER I
CULTURAL AND LITERARY BACKGROUND
1. MAHĀMATYA VASTUPĀLA, who lived in the first half of the 13th
century A. D. is a remarkable figure not only in the history of Gujarāt, but
also in the history of mediaeval Sanskrit literature. He and his younger
brother Tejapāla were ministers of king Vīradhavala of Dhavalakka (modern
Dholkā in the Ahmedabad district), who was a feudatory of king
Bhīmadeya II of Anahilavāda Pātan. Vastupāla was a shrewd politician
and a successful general, and came from a Jaina family belonging to
the Prāgvāța (Poryād) community, which is famous in the history of
Gujarāt for its valour, statesmanship and business acumen. But it is
noteworthy that Vastupāla was also a great patron of learning, a
promoter of literature and a philanthrophist, a man of religious
devotion and a great builder of monuments, such as the temples on Abu and
Girnār. Moreover, he was a Sanskrit poet of distinct merit, and is
known to have composed a Mahākāvya and several Stotras. Consequently
a large number of poets and scholars had gathered around him, who
made a remarkable contribution to various branches of mediaeval
Sanskrit literature. It is a rare thing in the history of India to find
such a bright galaxy of scholars and poets gathered around a person
who was not a king. In the long and varied history of Sanskrit literature,
there is hardly a figure round whom had grown, as 'round Vastupāla,
so much authentic material from contemporary pens surviving to this day.
This work aims at giving an exhaustive treatment, as far as possible,
of the life and works of Vastupāla, especially from cultural and literary
points of view, and adducing historical evidence to establish the
existence of a bright literary circle around him. It also aims at showing
how he and his literary circle have enriched Sanskrit literature in a variety
of ways.
2. To assess properly the work of Vastupāla and his literary circle,
it is necessary to understand the cultural and literary background
of his times, and it would be proper here to make a short survey of
literary and scholarly traditions prevailing in the age that preceded
his. It would show what Gujarāt has done to enrich the Sanskrit
literature at least since the times of the Valabhi kings. From this
point of view the history of Gujarāt has to show two very bright periods
one the period of the great savant Hemacandra (1088-1173 A. D.)
and the other that of Vastupāla. The former itas been dicussed at
length by Bühler in his Life of Hemacandrācārya and by Professor
R. C. Parikh in his introduction to the Kávyānuśāsana of Hemacandra.
The other period, that is the period of Vastupāla, is the subject of the
present work.
3. The intellectual and cultural life of cities like Anahilavād and
Dhavalakka where men like Hemacandra and Vastupāla lived and worked

Glory of Valabhi
4. Leaving aside Dvărakā of mythological times, which Śrī Kršņa made
his capital when he fled from Jarāsandha, we come to the historic city of
Girinagara (modern Junāgadh). It has the inscription of Asoka (274-237
B. C.) in Prākrit which was presumably understood in this part of the
country, and the Sanskrit inscription of Rudradāman (150 A. D.) in prose,
one of the earliest, if not the earliest, specimens of classical Sanskrit
literaure, and the inscription of Skandagupta ( 456 A. D.) in verse-all on a
rock at the foot of mt. Girnăr in the vicinity of Junāgadh. These are the
earliest remarkable literary records of Gujarāt, and they belong to the
well-known historical ages of India-viz, of the Mauryas, the Kștrapas
and the Guptas respectively. Next we come to the age of the Maitrakas
of Valabhī which was contemporary with the latter part of the Gupta age.
Valabhi (modern Valā or Valabhīpur in Saurāstra ) was a great centre of
Brahmanical, Budhhist as well as Jaina learning. The description of
Valabhī given by the great Chinese traveller Yuan-chang who came
there about 641 A. D. bears ample testimony to its splendour. According
to him, there were some hundred Samghārāmas, where about fooo
priests lived and studied the little vehicle (the tenets of Hinayāna)
according to the Sammatiyā school. Moreover, he say that “not far
'from the city is a great Samghārāma which was built by the Arhat
Co-che-lo)?; here the Bodhisattvas Gunamati and Sthiramati (Kien-hwui)3
'fixed thir residences during their travels and composed treatises which
have gained a high renown"!, Asamga, Vasubandhu and Sthiramati
are the three great names in the history of the Yogācāra sect of the
Mahāyāna Buddhism, and on the authority of Yhan-Chang we may
say that at least one of them, Sthiramati, who has commented upon
Vasubardhu's Triņšikā and also composed several Yogācāra' works, lived
near Valabhi, and that the study of Budhhist philosophy was a highly
prized subject there.
. . 5. That yalabhi was a great seat of learning is again proved by
.I-Tșing, a junior contemporary of Yuan-chang. According to him,
"Nālandã in South Behar and Valabhi were two places in India which
deserved comparison with the most famous centres of learning in China
and were frequented by crowds of eager students who commonly devoted
two or three years on attendance at lectures on Buddhist philosophy." 5'

CHAPTER I-CULTURAL AND LITERARY BACKGROUND
6. We have ample evidence to show that Brahmanical and waina
learning flourished at Valabhi. In the 32nd Taramga of the Kathasaritsagara
of Kashmirian Somadeva (IIth century A. D.), one Visuudatta has been
described as going to Valablī from Antarvedī for learning Vidya. Though
the Kathāsaritsāgara was composed in the 11th century, the reference
in question may be considered very old, because as it is well known,
it is a version of the lost Brhatkathā of Guņādhya, who lived in the
beginning of the Christian era. Grants of the Valabhi kings attest to
the royal patronage of the Vedic learning throughout the kingdom, and
learned Brahmins of Anandapura (modern Vadanagar) are conspicuous
in the grants. The great Bhattikávya or Rávaṇavadha (between about
500 and 650 A. D.), which is the first Vyākarana-Kāvya in the history
of Sanskrit literature, a veritable literary feat, was composed at Valabhi. The
Bhattikávya must have become a model for the composition of the two
Dvyáśraya Kávyas-one Sanskrit and another Prākrit-of Hemacandra,
which forin the most important sources for the study of history and culture of
Gujarāt in the Caulukya or Solamkī period. Naturally, the Bhattikávya
must be considered a single literary remain, which is, however, suggestive of a
vast literary activity. This inference would be considered right if we remember
that some kings of Valabhi are described as very learned. One of them,
Dhiruvasena II ( 329 A. D.) is described in one of the grants as specially
proficient in the science of Sālāturīya, that is the grammar of Pāṇini, and the
science of polity (cf. TETET TONTITITITETITE acons...... ). In a grant of
Dharasena II ( 478 A. D.) his father Guhasena is said to be well-versed in
composing works in three languages, viz. Sanskrit, Prākrit and Apabhrams'a
( HHATHAMŠTH197799qegat atâyvacica:FICUT: 1).. It may also be noted
in passing that though the Valabhī inscriptions are purely donatory, their formal
references to the donating ruler and his ancestors are in a style which
anticipates the elegant prose of the latter Sanskrit Gadyakávyas.
7. Evidence is not lacking to show that Valabhī was also a great
seat of Jaina' religion and learning. Jaina religion, though originating in
Magadha, had changed its centre of activity and in the early centuries of the
Christian era Ujjayini in Central India, Mathurā in the midland and Valabhi
in western India had become very important places of Jainism. The first
council for the redaction of the Jaina canon was convened at Pāšaliputra
during the second century after the Nirvāṇa of Malāvīra, when the first eleren
Amgas were compiled and the remnants of the fourteen Püryas were collected
to form a twelfth Aṁga, the Drstivāda. But in course of time the canon was
put into disorder, and a second council was convened by Arya Skandila at
Mathurā and by Arya Nāgārjuna at Valabhī almost simultaneously, in the ninth
century after the Nirvāṇa of Malāvīra ( Kalyāṇavijaya, Vīra Nirvāṇa Samvat,
1 R. O. Barikh, op. cit., p. 56.
2 HIG, No. 63.
3. Ibid, no. 50. According to Bühler (IA, Vol. X, p. 278 #.), this is a
spurious grant, and it is latter than the date wbich is mentioned in it,

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTTA VASTUPĀLA
P. 104). These two Acāryas, unfortunately, could not meet one another, and
hence there were many textual variations in the versions of the canon compiled
by both of them, one being known as the Mathuri Vácanā, and the other as
the Valablī Vācanã. After this, there came the great event of committing to
writing the Jain canon according to the Māthurī Vacanã, taking down the
variations of the Valablii Vācanã wherever necessary. In the year 980
(or 993 ) after the death of Mahāvīra (i. e, in A. D. 454 or 467 ) again
a council was held in Valabhi presided over by Devardhhigați
Ksamāśramaụa, for the purpose of collecting the sacred texts and writing them
down. The Jain canon as a whole was written down for the first time under
the auspices of this council and it is possible that the copies of different texts
of the canon were sent to different parts of the country for circulation
of the authentic version. In fact, this is a great event in Jaina history,
and it is quite significant that Valabliī was selected as the meeting-place
for these important councils.
8. Malla Vādin was a great Jaina scholar of Valabhi. He was the
author of the Nayacakra or Drādaśāranayacakra considered to be one of the
greatest works of Jaina logic. According to the Prabhāvakacarita (1 278 A.D.)
of Prabliācandrasurī, Malla was the youngest of the three brothers-the names
of the other two being Jitayasas or Jinayaśas and Yaksa. They had a mater-
nal uncle, who had become a Svetāmbara Jaina monk and was known as
Jinānandasūrī. He was defeated by a Budhhist monk named Nanda or
Budhliānanda in a public controversy at Brgukachha ( modern Broach). So
lre left that city and came to Valabhi, where he made his nephews his disciples.
All the three received sound training at Valablī, and became masters of Sāstras.
Jitayaśas wrote a Nyása on a work of grammar known as the Viśrāntavidyā-
dhara ;a Yakşa composed a work on astrology called Nimittāstāmgabodhini,
while Malla wrote his famous treatise Nayacakra. Malla went to Brgukachha
and defeated his uncle's opponent in a debate, and received the title of Vādin as
a token of victory. The Prabliāyakacarita gives the year of this event as 884
after the Nirvāna of Malāvīra (i, e. 358 A. D.), Unfortunately, the original
Nayacakra is not extant to-day, and we have to reconstruct the text with the
help of the commentary by Simha Ksamāśramaņa ( circa 700 A. D. ).
1 Traditions about these councils have beea preserved in the Nandi Cūrņi
( 677 A, D.) of Jinadāsagani Mahattara, Nandi Vrtti of Haribhadra
(701-771 A. D.). Vicăraśreni of Merutuṁga (14th cent. A. D.), Jyoti-
skarandaka Vịtti of Malayagiri ( 12th cent. A. D.), Lokaprakāśa ( 1652
A. D.) of Vinayavijaya, Sâmācārisataka ( 1616 A. D.) of Samayasundara,
and several other works. Final redaction of the Canon made by
Devardhhi notes the variations of the Valabhi Vācană indicated there as
Arquirit mor, and the commentators of the texts have added many more
under the head artSceATea qafa (i, e. the followers of the Nagarjuna
school read this way).
2 This work has been referred to by Hemacandra in his grammar (PF,
Vol. IV, p. 91). There its authorship has been ascribed to Vāmana

9. It is said that Malla Vādin had written a Tippana or gloss on
Dharmottara's commentary on the ' Nyāyabindu of the Budhhist scholar
Dharmakīrti. There is a tradition that he wrote a commentary on the
Sanmatitarka of Sidhlasena Divākara, which is another great work on jaina
logic. Acārya Hemacandra has paid a glowing tribute to Malla in his Sidhha-
Hema grammar, calling him the foremost among logicians. In addition to the
Prabhāvakacarita, the traditional account of this Jaina scholar is also found in
the Prabandhacintāmaņi ( 1305 A, D.) of Merutuṁga, the Prabandhakosa
( 1349 A. D.) of Rājasekhara, and several other works.
Cultural and Literary life at S'rīmāla
10. Valabhi fell at the hands of the Arabs from Sind most probably in 789
A. D., as given by Jinaprabhasūri, the author of the Vividhatīrthakalpa.3
This was the final attack of the Arabs by which the glory of Valabhī was
extinguished. “After the overthrow of Valabhí its place as chief city of
western India was taken by Anahilvád, which retained that honour until the
fifteenth century, when it was superseded by Ahmedabad."4 But before we
come to Anahilvād, it is necessary to have a glance at the cultural life that was
prevailing at Bhinnamāla or Srimāla, which was the first capital of the Gurjaras
who gave the name Gujarat to the province where they finally settled. Even
after Bhinnamāla ceased to be the capital, it was the people who hailed from
the place that mostly made the history of Gujarat. Vastupāla himself belonged
to the Prāgvāța community, which came from Śrīmāla.
11. On the authority of Yuan-chang, we may say that Bhinnamāla
which lies fifty miles west of Mount Abu was in the seventh century A. D. the
capital of a Gurjara kingdoin whose circuit was more than 830 miles. The
Višrantavieil (A Historie wrote the
1 Some scholars put Dharmottara in the Sth century A. D. (Vidyā-
bhūşaņa, History of the Mediaeval School of Indian Logic, pp.
34–35 ). The grammarian Vāman to whom Hemacandra has
ascribed the authorship of the Viśrāntavidyādhara probably lived in
the sixth century, according to Macdonell (A History of Sanskrit
Literature, p. 432 ) and others. If Malla Vādin who wrote the
Tippaña on Dharmottara is not different from the author of the
Nayacakra, there might be some inaccuracy in the traditional date
given by the Prabhāvakacarita. For a diseassion of the date of
Malla Vādin, vide Vidyābhūşana, A History of Indian Logic, pp.
194 f., where Malla Vādin is assigned to the 9th century A. D. by
taking the traditional date in the Vikrama (or Saka) era instead
of the Vira era. Jambuvijaya ( Viśāla Bhārata, Vol. XLIII, p. 415 ),
however, upholds the traditional date adducing various reasons in
its favour.

6 Now-a-days Bhinnamāla is not included in the limits of Gujarāt
proper. But it is well-knorn that at least upto the sixteenth century
Gujarāt and Rājasthān were one from cultural and linguistic points

LITERÁRY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPALA
present ruins of that city', objects of interest in it and its surroundings, several
old inscriptions which are found there and also the mythological and traditional
account of the city given in the work known as the Srīmālapurāņa-are enough
to prove that the site of the present Bhinnamāla was once a large and flouri-
sling city. The Prabhávakacarita (ch. XIV-XV) gives fine descriptions of
Srīmāla, and as late as 1612 A. D. an English merchant Nicholas Ufflet has
spoken of its fortifications, enclosing a circuit of thirtysix miles, containing
many fine tanks going to ruins, of which almost no trace remains now-a-days.
12. Just like Valabhīpur, the capital city of Srimāla was also a centre
of Brahmanical and Jaina learning, and on the authority of Yuan-chang we
may say that Buddhism also prevailed there. According to the Śrīmālapurāna,
Srīmala had one thousand Brahmaśālās and four thousand Mathas where
different branches of learning were taught (Adhyāya 12, verse 22; and also
Adhyāya 71 ); and the Purāņa says that:-
चतुर्वेदाः साङ्गाश्च त्युपनिषत्सहितास्तथा । सर्वशास्त्राणि वर्तन्ते श्रीमाले श्रीनिकेतने । ।
(Adhyāya 71, verse 9 )
13. But the first authentic source of information about Bhinnamāla
is an inscription of Varmalāta, who, according to the Prabhāvakacarita was a
king of Bhinnamāla. This inscription is dated V. S. 682 ( = 626 A. D.). This
is probably the same Varmalāta who is referred to by Māgha in the Prasasti of
his Siśupālavadha. If this identity is accepted, we can place Māgha, who
according to tradition, was a poet of Srimāla, 50 years after this, or considering
his reference to Jinendrabudhhi's Nyāsa on the Kāśikā, about 700 A. D.;3 for
Suprabhadeva, the grandfather of Māgha was prime minister of Varmalāta, the
name of the poet's father being Dattaka who was addressed as Sarvāśraya by
the people for his friendliness towards all. It may be that Máglia ended every
canto of his poem with the word Sri for which he is called Bryamka with a
view to commemorate his city Srimāla.
14. Another great name from Srimāla is that of tlie astronomer Brahn-
agupta who completed his work Brāhmasphutasidhhānta in Saka Samvat
of vier, and hence the name 'Old Western Rajasthāni' given by
scholars like Tessitori to a language which is properly speaking Old
Gujarāti. During the Caulukya.times, politically as well as cultu.
rally Gujarāt included north Gujarāt as well as Rājasthān, and
Lata or South Gujarat was added later on only after its final
conquest by Sidhharāja Jayasiinha. It is possible that Gujarāt and
Rājásthān developed in their own individual ways after a Sultanate,
independent of Delhi, was established at Abmedabad in the fifteenth
century.

550, that is, 628 A. D., when Vyāghramukha of the capa dynasty was ruling
there. On account of the city of his residence Brahmagupta is famous in Indian
literature as the Bhillamālakācārya.
15. Jaina learning also greatly flourishe:l as Stīmāla. The famous
Upamitibhavaprapañcakathā of Sidhharşi was completed there, according to
the author's own statement, in V. S. 962 ( = 906 A. D.). The Jaina literary
form known as Dharmakathā or religious novel, reaches its culmination in this
allegorical kathā-work. In the Prasasti of the work, Sidhharşi mentions in
- his genealogy of teachers the names of Sūryācārya of the Niryrtti Kula, Dellama-
hattara and Durgasvāmin, a wealthy Brahmin who had become a Jaina monk,
• and who died at Bhinnamāla. He then speaks with enthusiasm and great
respect of the Acãrya Haribhadra to whom he is indebted for enlightenment in
the true religion and of whom he has spoken in Book I of his work as the
"awakener of true knowledge of the religion" (Dharmabodhakara). These
Words would lead one to believe that Haribhadra must have been the immedi-
ate teacher. of the poet. Nevertheless, that is impossible if we consider the
date of Haribhadrasūri ( 701-771 A. D. ) Established on most unimpeachable
authority by Ācārya Jinavijayaji.? And we may safely assume, as Jinavijayaji
chas done, that Sidhharși pays Haribhadra such a glowing tribute only. because
Che has derived the greatest inspiration from his writings. Sidhharsi says that
- he chose the form of allegory in order to attract the readers, and for the same
reason he wrote in Sanskrit, and not in Prākrit, because Prākrit is for the
uneducated, whilst even the educated are to be won over to the true doctrine
from their heretical views. Upamitibhavaprapañcakatha is the first long
Sanskrit work composed by a Jaina author, and that show's how by that time
the Jainas found it necessary to write in Sanskrit instead of Prākrit in order to
appeal to the whole world of Indian scholarship. The great popularity that
Sidhharsi's work enjoyed among the Jainas is shown by the fact that only
100 years after its appearance, extracts and abridgments. were made from it,
and even Hemacandra uses names in one of the stories in the Parisistaparvan,
which presupposes that it was universally known, Sidhharsi also made a
Sanskrit version of Prākrit Candraprabhacaritra, wrote commentaries on the
Prakrit Upadeśamālā of Dharmadāsa Gani and on the Nyāyāvatāra of Sidhha-
sena Divākara.
16. As seen above Srimāla was one of the centres of activity of Hari-
bhadrasūri, the author of many important. works on Jaina philosophy, and
a general work on the schools of Indian philosophy known as the Saddar-
sanasamuccaya, a long, Prakrit Dharmakathā named Samarāiccakahā, a
satirical kathā-work like the Dhūtākhyāna, a number of religious Prakaranas

and Sanskrit commentaries on several Jaina canonical works. He is perhaps
the first among those Jaina authois who commented in Sanskrit on the
original Prākrit Sūtras. While utilizing the old Prākrit commentaries he
retained the narratives in their original Prākrit form.
17. Another ancient Prākrit Dharmakathā-the Kuvalayamālā of
Udyotanasūri was composed at Jābālipura (modern Jhalor in Mārvād ), a
town not very far away from Bhinnamāla, in Saka era 700, that is 778
A. D. On the author's own statement in the Prasasti, Tattvācārya had
viven him initiation in the religious order. In addition to this, the author
has mentioned two of his Vidyāgurus: One of them was Vīrabhadra who
had got constructed a temple of the first Tīrthamkara Adinātha in Jābālipura,
He had taught the author Jain religious tenets. The other was Haribhadra,
composer of many Sástras, who had taught him logic. Thus Haribhadra was
a senior contemporary of Udyotanasūri. In the genealogy of his teachers the
author has referred to an Acārya named Deragupta who was a Mahākavi,
and his pupil Sivacandra, who had selected Srimāla as the place of his
residence (Verses 5-7.)?
18. These few instances will suffice to give an idea of the active literary
life of Srimāla, which was the immediate inspiring model of Anahilvād Pāțaq,
In this period, upto 953 A. D. Srīmāla seems to have remained as the most
important city in Gurjara Des'a.? Immediately after that, during the reign
of one Bhimasena, a migration of 18000 Gurjars from Srīmāla is recorded.
According to the Srimāla Purāṇa, Srī left that city in V.S. 1203 (1147 A.D.).
If this statement is to be believed, there must have been a great exodus of
population from Srīmāla to Northern Gujarāt and to Anahilvāda in particular.
Most of the Brāhmins and Baniās, and a large number of artisan classes of
Gujarat trace their place of origin in Mārvād, and some of them in Srīmāla
proper and its suburbs. S'rīmāli Brāhmins and Baniās, Prāgvāța (Porvāđ=
staying in the eastern part of Srīmāla ) Baniãs and S'rīmāli Sonis (gold-smiths )
are, as is evident from their caste-names, from S'rīmāla proper. Anahilavāð
had profited at the expense of S'rīmāla, by the migration of this great refugee
population, and we find later on how the S'rīmālis and Prāgvātas had made
their contribution to the political, cultural and religious life of Gujarāt. We
see some of them as great administrators and generals, proficient composers of
literary works, builders of monuments and religious leaders of their times.

contemporary records, no inscriptions and no coins of the Cāvadās, and that they
are referred to as robbers in works like the Prabandhacintamani,? we are
justified in assuming that their sway extended to only a limited region
surrounding their capital town. Their rule came to an end in 942 A, D.,
when Mūlarāja, nephew of the last Cāvadā ruler Sīmantasimha, usurped the
throne after murdering his maternal uncle, who was addicted to drink and
had given away his kingdom to Mūlarāja in a spell of intoxication. Even
during these times, when Anahilyādl was a small principality, we find at least
one instance which characteristically shows how the literary life of Bhinnamāla
had continued at places around Anahilvād. We have already mentioned
that one Tattvācārya was preceptor of Udyotanasūri, the author of the Kuralaya-
mālā (see supra Para 17). It is possible to identify him with Silācārya or
i sommes to th
Sīlāṁkācārya who wrote learned commentaries on the first two Angas of
the Jaina canon–viz. the Acārāmga and the Sūtrakrtāmga, in Gambliutá
(modern Gambhu), only a few miles from Pātan. This identification is
based on the fact that the said commentator Silāmka was also known as
Tattvāditya, which is just an equivalent of Tattvācārya. Moreover, in the
12th verse of the Prasasti of the Kuvalayamālā, while mentioning Tattvācārya,
the author has, through a pun, referred to Silāmka. There is also a tradition
that Sīlāṁkācārya was identical with Sīlagunasūri, the Guru of Vanarāja, the
founder of Anahilvād Pāțan. The Jaina tradition says that Vanarāja and
his mother were protected by Silagunasūri, when Vanarāja's father was killed
and his kingdom was usurped by the enemies.
20. Mūlarāja, the first ruler of the illustrious Caulukya dynasty that
reigned at Anahilvãd, was a great general and a far-sighted statesman; and
developed the Gujarīt kingdom from the small principality that he got from
the Cāvadās. He overcame Bārappa, the viceroy of the Deccan Caulukyas
in Lāta; destroyed the formidable Graharipu of Saurastra; and subdued
Lākhã Phulāņī of Kachha. He built the famous Rudramahālaya at Sidhhapura,
which was one of the greatest architectural monuments of the Caulukya period;
and invited the learned Brahmins of Uttarăpatha to come and settle in
1 26th Kalpa of the VTK of Jinaprabha. Also R. C. Parikh, op. cit.,

It must be noted here that though the said identification is quite
probable, it cannot be considered final until the problem of the date
of the composition of the commentary of the Ācārāṁga, which is
tentatively believed by some as 877 A. D. (JSI, p. 181 ), is finally settled.

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MARĀMATYA VASTUPALA
Gujarāt. It was in times of Mularāja that the name 'Gujarat' began to
be used for the province. Cultural and literary expansion came in the
wake of political expansion and reached its height in the times of Sidhharāja
Javasirha and Kumārapāla in the twelfth century. Though peace of Gujarat
was seriously disturbed for some time by the terrible onslaught of Mahmud of
Gaznā (1024 A. D.) during the rule of Bhimadeva I (1022-1064 A. D.),
the general literary culture was a matter of continuous growth. After the
foundation of the Gurjara empire at Anahilvādi pāțan we find an intensive literary
activity mostly of the Jaina scholars and poets especially in the region of Nor-
thern Gujarīt. Out of them, Sāntisūri ( 11th century ) and Nemicandra (1073
A. D.), the authors of two separate commentaries on the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra,
which are very useful to the scholar and the student respectively; Abhayadeva-
sūri (1061 1. D.), who wrote learned commentaries on the nine Amgas of the
Jain Canon and hence was known as the Navāṁgī-vrttikāra, and Dronācārya,
who revise these commentaries; and two brothers—Jineśvara and Budhhisāgara
(first half of the IIth century ) who wrote on various religious and secular subjects
---deserve special mention.3
21. From all available evidence we gather that the poets and dialecticians
of the different sects from many parts of India visited the capital of Gurjaradeśa.
And even in the case of the learned men of the Jaina sect, their erudition is
more shown by their proficiency in logic and the art of dialectics, mastery of
all the schools of philosophy, their thorough grounding in grammar and the
science of language, and their cleverness in poetic composition. Tarka, Lak-
sana and Sāhitya or logic, grammar and poetics are some of the main subjects
that formed the common field of intellectual activity in India, and these three
are specially mentioned as the Vidyātrayī by the Jaina writers from Gujarat.5
22. There was a keen cultural rivalry between Anahilavād and Dhārā, or so
to say, between Gujarāt and Mälvā. The scholars of one region were going to
the other to fight the intellectual battle on behalf of their country. On
account of this rivalry the general cultural life of Mālvā and Gujarāt together
was a matter of continuous growth, though the rulers were fighting continuously
and causing some political disturbances. When Gujarat and Mālvā did not form
one political unit, they often waged bitter wars against each other, and as a
result, were joined together when Sidhharāja Jayasimha finally conquered
Málvā in 1136–37 A. D.?

23. Sidhharāja Jayasimha (1094–1143 A, D.) is the most remembered of
all the kings of Gujarāt. He still lives in the folk-literature and folk-dramas,
Like Vikrama and Bhoja, he has almost become a legendary figure. In fact, it
appears to have been the ambition of Jayasimha to emulate Vikramăditya of
Ujjayini in all fields of life. His court had become a favourite place for
scholars coming from different parts of India. Important debates like that
between Digambara Kumudacandra and Svetāmbara Vādi Devasūri were held
in his court, and he used to preside on such occasions, which shows that he
was sufficiently conversant with different branches of learning prevalent in his
times. He found in Hemacandra a great literary figure who could compose
works which would stand side by side the literary glories of Mālvā.
24. The celebrated Hemacandra was a pupil of Deyacandra. He was one
of the most versatile and prolific writers, who worked in the most varied doma-
ins, both as a poet and a scholar. It was due to him that Gujarāt became a
main stronghold of the Svetāmbara Jainas and has remained so for centuries,
and that Jaina literature flourished so exceedingly there in the 12th and the
13th centuries. He was not, however, only the author of Jinistic works, but
in addition, he provided Gujarât with important text-books on secular. branches
of learning (grammar, lexicography, poetics and metrics ), so that he was called
"The Omniscient of the Kali age" (Kalikālasarvajña). He was born at Dhand-
hukā, a town in the neighbourhood of Ahmedabad in 1089 A. D. as the son
of a merchant. His parents were pious Jainas, and in his early childhood he
was already destined for the life of a monk. As a Jaina teacher he spent the
greater part of his life in the capital of Gujarát. When Sidhharāja returned
triumphant from a war with Mālvā, learned men of Anahilavāų had waited
upon him to offer their congratulations. Sidhharāja, jealous of the literary
glory of Ujjayinī, asked Hemacandra to write a Grammar, and procured for
the scholar all the grammars available then from different parts of the country.
Hemacandra compiled his famous text-book of grammar, and associating his
name with that of the monarch, called it Sidhha-Hemacandra. Sidhharāja
got copies of it made, and sent them to various kingdoms of India. Twenty
copies were sent to Kashmīr, the then home of learning. Hemacandra also
composed two Dvyāśraya Mahākávyas-one Sanskrit and another Prākrit-in
which, while illustrating the rules of Sanskrit and Prākrit Grammar, he celebra-
ted the glories of his two patrons, Sidhharāja and his successor Kumārapāla
(1143–1174 A. D.) along with an authentic poetical history of their dynasty,
There is scarcely any branch of literature in which Hemacandra has not given
his special contribution. One of his junior conteniporaries, Somaprabhācārya,
has succinctly described his literary achievements in the following slokam
क्लप्तं व्याकरणं नवं विरचितं छन्दो नवं व्याश्रयालंकारौ प्रथितौ नवौ प्रकटितं श्रीयोगशास्त्रं नवम् ।
तर्कः सञ्जनितो नवो जिनवरादीनां चरित्रं नवं बद्धं येन न केन केन विधिना मोहः कृतो दूरतः ॥
1 R, C. Parikh, op. cit., p. 162,
2 We find a fine delineation of the debate between Kumudacandra and
Devasūri, and also of Jayasimha and his court in a historical play by
Yasascandra, viz. the Mudritakumudacandra Prakarana.

“He composed a new Grammar-the Sidhha-Hemacandra, a new science of
metrics-the Chandonušāsana, two Dvyāśraya-Kavyas and the Kavyānuśāsana,
a new Yogaśāstra, a new logic-the Pramāṇamīmāṁsā, and a new biography of
the Jinas etc--the Trişasti-salākāpuruşacaritra and the Parisistaparyan. In
what way has he not removed our ignorance?”
In addition to these works Hemacandra wrote Anekārthasaṁgraha, a
dictionary of homonyms; Abhidhānacintamani, a dictionary of synonyms;
Deśīnāmamālā, a lexicon of non-Sanskritic Prākrit words; Nighanțušesa in three
volumes, two of them dealing with medicine and botany, and the third with
jewels; and also a number of philosophical stotras.Not only Gujarat and the
Jaina community owe a great debt of gratitude to Hemacandra but he has a
place of honour in general Sanskrit Literature.2 .
25. Jayasimha's successor Kumārapāla (1143-1174 A. D.), originally a
devotee of Siva, was greatly influenced by Jinistic teachings of Hemacandra,
and considered him as his Guru. As a result of Hemacandra's teaching Kumā.
rapāla renounced hunting, and prohibited in his entire realm the slaughter of
aniinals, the eating of meat and the drinking of intoxicants, dice-playing, animal-
fighting and betting. He erected Jaina temples, and favoured the literary
efforts of the Jainas. In his honour Hemacandra has called his second Dvya-
śraya Kávya, which illustrates the rules of the Prākrit part of his Grammar,
Kumārapālacarita, and has described therein the life of Kumārapāla as a pious
Jaina. During the reign of these two kings, Jayasimha and Kumárapāla, not
only Hemacandra and his disciples, but a large number of poets and scholars,
both Jaina and non-Jaina, wrote their works; and Gujarát enjoyed a period of
intense literary activity.
26. Hemacandra's educational work seems to have been no less fruitful
than his literary activities. A number of his pupils have left works on various
branches of Sanskrit literatureChief among those pupils was Ramacandra,
a great lover of personal freedom, notable dramatist, and author of a rare
work on dramaturgy, viz. the Nātyadlarpaya. Another pupil of Hemacandra,
Guyacandra, had collaborated with Rāmacandra in writing the Natyadarpaņa.
The work contains quotations from Višākhadatta's lost drama Devīcandragupta,
which have proved of great value in reconstructing a forgotten chapter in the
Gupta history. It also contains references to a number of Sanskrit plays, extant
and non-extant, some of them by the author himself. Dhananjaya's work,
Dasarūpaka ( 10th century A. D.), must have been known to Ramacandra,
yet his Nātyadarpaụa seems to have been compsed on original lines. He
seems to embody in this work some traditions about the types of drama and
the nature and classifications of Rasas, which are different from Bharata. Out
of about two dozen Sanskrit plays written in Gujarāt, not less than eleven are

from the pen of Ramacandra. Rāmacandra has written at least four varieties
of Sanskrit drama-viz. Nāțaka, Prakaraṇa, Nātikā, and Vyāyoga.
27. Among other pupils of Hemacandra we have the names of Mahendra-
sūri, who wrote a commentary on the Anekārthakośa of Hemacandra; Deva-
candra, the author of a historical play Candralekhāvijayaprakarana, which
describes Kumārapāla's conquest of Arnorāja, the king of Sapādalakṣa or
Sākambharī ( modern Sambhar in Rajputānā), and his marriage with Arporāja's
sister; Vardhamāna Gani, who had written an erudite commentary on the
Kumāravihāraprasasti Kāvya of Rămacandra, describing a temple Kumāravihāra
built by Kumārapāla; Udayacandra, who had corrected some granımatical
mistakes in the Yogaśātra of Hemacandra; Yaśascandra, who has been referred
to in the Prabhāvakacarita? and the Kumārapālaprabandha;- and lastly Bālaca-
ndra, who was partly responsible for the cruel death of Rāmacandra at the
hand of king Ajayapāla, successor of Kumārapāla and a hater of the Jainas.3
Tradition credits Hemacandra with a large number of pupils, and it is possi-
ble that he had njany more than those mentioned above.
28. Among notable contemporaries of Hemacandra we may mention the
blind poet-laureate of Sidhharāja, viz. Śrīpāla who came from a Prágvāta
family. He had written a Prasasti of the famous Sahasralimga lake constructed
by Sidhharāja, only a fragment of which has been preserved on a slab found
in a temple at Pāțaụ. It is also said that he had written the Praśasti of the
Rudramahālaya, which was repaired by Sidhharāja. At the end of his
famous Prasasti of the fort of Vadnagar composed in 1150 A, D, during the
reign of Kumārapāla, S'rīpāla says about himself-
एकाहनिष्पन्नमहाप्रबन्धः श्रीसिद्धराजप्रतिपन्नबन्धुः ।
श्रीपालनामा कविचक्रवर्ती प्रशस्तिमेतामकरोत्प्रशस्ताम् ।।
The Mahāprabandha which is referred to here must be none other than the
Vairocanavijaya mentioned in the Prabhāvakacarita. S'rīpāla was a friend
of Sidhharāja and chief among the poets at his court. About his rivalry and
contact with Devabodha of the Bhagavata sect who had come to Awahilavād,
as also with other scholars, we get a wealth of information from the
Prabandhas. We also find that some of the contemporary poets were
coming to Srīpāla for getting their works revised. 10

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPALA
29. It is an interesting fact that Srīpāla's son Sidhhapāla also was a good
poet, and Somaprabhācārya had composed his Prākrit work, Kumārapālaprati-
bodha, which has for its subject the sermons of the teacher Hemacandra to
his royal disciple, while staying in the Upāśraya of Sidhhapāla, in 1185 A, D,
Sidhhapála's son Vijayapāla also was a dramatist, and we get one of his
works, Draupadisvayamvara, which was performed at Anahilvād at the
order of Bhimadeva II in the Tripurusaprāsāda built by Mülarāja. It is not
a frequent occurrence in history of literature when favour of the Muse has
been continuously showered in this way on three successive generations,
30. Among other authors of this period worthy of mention is Vágbhata,
the author of Vágbhatālamkāra, a work on poetics. This author is often
confused with the minister Vāgbhata, son of minister Udayana, and also with
another Vāgbhata, son of Nemikumāra, who wrote a work on poetics called
the Kávyānusāsana and who flourished later. But these three are really diff-
erent persons. Our author was the son of Soma. He was a follower of
Jaina religion, as is evident from the benedictory verses of his work. As prof.
R. C. Parikh has rightly inferred, this work must have been finished between
Jayasimha's conquest of Málvā (1136 A. D.), and his death (1143 A. D.),
because it refers to the said victory and has no verse in praise of Kumārapāla.?
31. Two other notable Sanskrit plays of the time are the Pārthaparãe
kramavyayoga of Prahlādanadeva ( About 1170 A. D.) and Moharājapa-
rājaya of Yasahpāla (between 1174 and 1177 A, D.). Prahladanadeya, the
author of the former play was a brother of Dhārāvarsa, the lord of Candrāyati,
and a feudatory of Kumārapāla. It was acted on the occasion of the festival
of the investment of Acaleśvara, the tutelary deity of Mount Abu, with the
sacred thread, as is mentioned in the Prastāvanā, and claims to exhibit the
sentiment of excitement (Dīptarasa ). The story, taken from the Virāța
Parvan of the Mahābhārata, is a well-known episode of the recovery by Arjuna
of the cows of Virāța, raided by the Kauravas, and the defeat of the raiders.
The poet, whose fame as a warrior and whose princely generosity are extolled
by Vastupāla's friend Someśvara in his poem Kirtikaumudī, claims for his
poetry the merits of smooth composition and clearness. Technically the play
is of some interest, because immediately after the Nāndi the Sthāpaka enters,
recites a couple of stanzas, and then an actor comes on the stage who addresses
him, but is answered by the Sūtradhāra; apparently the two terms are consi-
dered synonymous by the author of the play or the later tradition. Moreover,
the final benediction is allotted not to Arjuna, the hero of the play, but to
Vásava, who appears at the close of the play in a celestial chariot in company
with the Apsarasas to bestow his blessing. Prahladana wrote other works,
of which some verses are preserved in anthologies; he must have been a man
of considerable ability and merit. He is the only author in Gujarāt, who
after Ramacandra has attempted the form of Vyāyoga. It is also interesting

15
to note that he was the founder of the city of Prahladanapur or Palanpur in
north Gujarāt.
32. Moharājaparājaya was composed by Yasahpāla, the Jaina minister of
Kumārapāla's successor Ajayapāla. Apparently the play was written during
the reign of Ajayapāla ( 1174-77 A. D. ), and was performed on the occasion
of the Yātrāmahotsava of the idol of Mahāvíra at the Kumāravihāra, a temple
erected by Kumārapāla, at Thārāpadra (modern Tharād in the Banāskānthā
district), where the author seems to have been governor or only a resident.
The play is an example of a Jaina allegory of comparatively early date. It
describes the conversion of Kumārapāla to Jainism, his prohibition of the
killing of animals, and his cessation from the practice of confiscating the pro-
perty of persons dying without heirs ( Rudatīvitta ) in his realm, as a result of
the efforts of the famous sage, Hemacandra. The title of the play means
"conquest on king Moha or ignorance”, and all the personages in it, save the
king, Hemacandra and the Vidūsaka, are the personifications of qualities, good
and evil. The play is certainly not without merits. In the main it is
written in simple Sanskrit, and is free from the artifices which disfigure more
pretentious plays, and it has the merit of bringing vividly before us the activi-
ties of Jainism in the regulation of Kumārapāla's kingdom, throwing an
interesting light on what is known from inscriptions and other sources of
the history of Gujarat. Interesting details are given of the different forms
of gambling and of the sects which approve slaughter. The Prākrits are,
of course, deeply influenced by Hemacandra's grammar. We may profita-
bly compare this allegorical play with an earlier piece, viz. the Prabodha-
candrodaya of Krsyamiśra ( 11th century ) which may have influenced
it to a certain extent.
33. A great Sanskrit commentator of the Jaina canonical works was
Ācārya Malayagiri. In addition to writing commentaries on several Jaina
Agamas he has commented upon a number of non-canonical works, and has
written a Sanskrit grammar called the Mustivyākaraṇa ('concise grammar' ).
Malayagiri has not given any personal information in his works nor has he
mentioned the date of composition in any of them. But he has referred to
"the reign of Kumārapāla” in some of them, and has given an illustration-
375072 SARTOISTA in his grammar. Hence it is evident that Malayagiri must
have lived in or about the reign of Kumārapāla. In his commentaries we find
both great scholarship and lucidity side by side and so they are very important
for the student. We have four great names among the Sanskrit commentators
of the Agama-viz. Haribhadra, Silāņka, Abhayadeva, and Malayagiri.
Malayagiri is last but not the least of them. It is noteworthy in the history
of Jaina literature that though the original canon was composed in Magadha,
the final redaction of it and all the commentaries on it have been written in
the Gurjaradesa.

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPALA
34. Leaving the reign of Kumārapāla and his successors and coming
further to the end of the 12th century A, D., we get a work which is
valuable for the study of the whole of the Indian Kathā-literature. That
work is the Pañcākhyāna of the Jaina monk Pūrṇabhadra. It was composed
in 1199 A, D., when probably Vastupāla and his brother Tejapāla were in
their teens. Pañcáklıyāna is a version of the Western Indian Pañcantantra,
the Textus Simplicior, which is the most famous recension of the original,
showing clear influence of the Tantrākhyāyikā, that is, the Kashmirian
recension of the Pañcatantra, and containing additions of a few stories from
some unknown source, probably from folk-lore. But the real merit of the
work lies in the fact that the author has edited the whole Textus Simplicior
carefully, because by his time its text had become very corrupt. He had
undertaken this editing at the instance of one Soma Mantrin,? who has
not been properly identified as yet. As stated in the colophon of the work,
he had revised the original text word by word, and prepared "a new version,
the like of which does not exist anywhere”: We must admit that this is
not an editing of the Pañcatantra in the modern sense according to the
science of textual criticism, but it is clear that Pūrṇabhadra must have coll-
ected a number of manuscripts belonging to different schools and corrected
the readings of the Textus Simplicior, which was enjoying great popularity
in India, and hence had become full of textual corruptions. The success of
Purnabhadra is attested by the fact that at a number of places in the Western
Indian Pañcatantra we can arrive at a correct reading and logical interpret-
ation only by accepting the reading supplied by him.*
35. This is but a short account of only some of the prominent literary
figures and literary works of the Gurjaradeśa. Hundreds of works in Sans-
krit, Prākrit and Apabhramsa and also in a post-Apabhraṁsa dialect which
must have been current in those days in the province were composed at
Anahilvād and various parts of the Caulukya kingdom of Gujarāt, from the
days of Mūlarāja upto Karņa Vāghelā, the last Hindu king who ruled at
Anahilvād (1296–1304) and even after that right upto the 18th century.
They cover all the branches of literature, both religious and secular, and
because a greater part of all this literary treasure has remained unpublished,
in Bhāydārs accessible only to a few scholars, it has not been better known
to the students at large, and one has to be satisfied by merely having a
glance at the descriptive catalogues prepared by research-workers over a
whole generation.

36. Anahilvad Pãtan was the nerve-centre of the vast Gurjar dominion
which at its zenith in the reign of Kumārapāla extended from Konkaụ in the
south to the whole of Rājputānā in the north, and from Cutch and Saurástra
in the west and the border-land of Sird in the north-west to the whole of
· Mālvā in the east. Seeds of disruption of the Gujarāt power were already
sown in the last days of Kumārapāla's life? Though the decline is clearly
visible during the reign of Bhimadeva II (1179-1242 A. D.) who was the
third ruler from Kumārapāla—the intermediate two rulers enjoying power
for a very short time—the glory of Gujarāt shone bright again in the time of
Viradhavala Vāghelã and his great ministers Vastupāla and Tejapāla. Consi-
dering very important position which Pátan enjoyed throughout the media-
eval Hindu rule in Western India, we would be well-advised to have again a
glace at the splendour of that great city.
37. There is no evidence to show that during the Caulukya and the
Vághelā period there was anything like a system of census, such as we find in
the Maurya times. But from several descriptions which we get of Anahilvād,
we have no hesitation in saying that it had an enormous population. At
places it has been referred as the "Narasamudra" ("The ocean of men”).
Naturally it was a great centre of trade and commerce. We have a number
of important descriptions of the city in contemporary literary works. Descri-
ptions by Hemacandra in his two Dvyāśraya Kävyas, and by Someśvara in
his Kīrtikaumudi are very remarkable, and inspite of poetic exaggerations and
embellishments, they are 'sufficiently realistic to guide the student's historical
imagination. The great lake Sahasralimga, built by Sidhharāja, which was
surrounded by 1008 Siva temples and 108 Devi temples, and the great Kirtis-
tambha on which Srīpāla's Prasasti of the lake was inscribed must have made
the surroundings of Anahilvād really magnificent. Satraśālās and Mathas
providing for various departments of learning, where teachers and students
were given free lodging, boarding and clothing by the state, must have made
the area something like a University suburb. Every sect found a place, and
all the schools of philosophy including Budhhist logic4 were studied in the
city. As we shall have occasion to see in the case of Vastupāla, general
religious tolerance prevailed everywhere, and we have instances in which
different members of a family professed different religions, keeping harmonious
relations with one another. There are a number of cases in which persons of
the ruling class had become Jaina monks, most interesting among them being
that of Droņācārya ( para 20 ), who was a maternal uncle of Bhimadeva I and
of Surācārya who was a nephew as well as pupil of Dronācārya. .
38. General culture of the city was at a high level, as mentioned in the
foregoing pages. In addition to the Vidyāmathas conducted by the state, the

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASTUPĀLA
Caitvas and Mathas of the different sects, in facts were the academies and colleges
where the Vidyātravi and allied subjects were taught and discussed. It would
be interesting to note that in Anahilavād and other towns Sanskrit plays were
performed on festive occasions, and the people flocked to see them in great
enthusiasm. This would not have been possible unless the common people
understool the general sense of Sanskrit and Prākrit dialogues. The plays
were performed generally in the temples at the order of either the king or minister
or a wealthy member of the merchant class. The Karyasundarī Nātikā of the
famous Kashmirian poet Bihlaņa, composed during his short stay in Ayahilvád
in the reign of Karna Solamkī ( 1064-1094 A. D. ), the father of Sidhharāja, was
performed in the temple of Adinātha at the instance of the minister Sampat-
kara or Sāntu. Candralekhāvijayaprakaraṇa of Devacandra, one of Hema-
candra's pupils (vide supra para 27 ), was performed in the Kumāravihāra
for the entertainment of Kumārapāla’s assembly. We have already referred
to the acting of the Pārthaparākramavyāyoga of Prahládana and the Moha-
rájaparājaya of Yasahpāla ( see supra para 31–32 ). The Draupadisvayřvara
of Vijayapāla, who was definitely a contemporary of Vastupāla, and lived in
the first half of the 13h century A. D., was acted in the Tripurusaprāsāda on
the occasion of the Vasantotsava at the order of Bhimadeva II, and the Prabu-
ddharauhiņeya of Rāmabhadr., delineating the enlightenment of a thief
Rauhiųeya, a contemporary of Mahāvīra according to the Jaina stories, was
enacted at Jhalor about year 1200 A. D. by two brothers and merchant-
princes-Yasovīra and Ajayapāla in a temple built by them. We shall have
occasion later on to review those plays which were got performed by Vastu-
pāla and his family-members; but the instances given above are enough to
support our main argument regarding the cultural conditions prevailing in Guj-
arāt. Gujarāt is perhaps the only province in India where merchants belonging
to Vanik castes like Prāgvāta, Srīnāli etc, were scholars ( cf. ch. IV, last foot-
note). They composed Sanskrit and Prākrit works not only of the Kavya and
Nătaka variety, but also works belonging to other branches of literature
like poetics and philosophy. We find some of them who were less learned,
requesting their teachers and preachers to write for their enlightenment
books on different subjects. Getting the books copied down and also
giving them as donation to deserving scholars as well as establishment of
Bhāụdārs or manuscript-libraries were considered highly meritorious
1 B.J. Sāndesarā, up, cit., pp. 50 ff. We may note here in passing that even
after the establishment of Muslim rule in Gujarāt and an independent
Gujarātī Sultanate at Ahmedabad the tradition of staging the Sanskrit
plays had continued, at least in a few surviving Hindu states. About the
year 1119 A. D. we have a nine-act play, the Gamgādāsapratāpavilāsa of
Gamgādhara, a protege of Gaṁgādāsa, king of Chām pārver, a bill-fort in
the Panchanahāl district. It is a historical play based on a contemporary
event describing the defeat of Sultan Muhammad II of Ahmedabad at the
hand of Gamgādāsa. The play depicts the heroic sentiment, and it was
performed at Chimpāner in the assembly-hall of the shrine of the goddess
Mahākāli.

deeds, as Jñāna or books was one of the seven Knetras enjoined by the
Jaina religion for spending wealth. But this does not mean that literary
activity in Gujarat was restricted to the followers of the Jaina faith.
Saivism was the hereditary faith of the Caulukya dynasty, and the
Purohita was generally a learned person. Someśvara, the friend and
protege of Vastupāla, was one of those hereditary pricsts. It was through
the good offices of one of his ancestors-Soma or Someśvara-that during
the reign of Durlabharāja ( 1010-1022 A. D. ) the Suvihita monks of Jain
sect could get residence in Pātan in the tecth of opposition by the
Caityavāsī monks of the same sect. The king patronised learning; and
poetry, scholarship and learned debates flourished at his court. Conse-
quently, the Brahmins also must have composed a considerable number
of literary works, because they had in herited the traditional lore through
generations. But in comparision to the works composed by the Jainas,
the Brahmin works which have survived are very small in number, many
of the compositions being irretrievably lost. The reason of this lies in the
fact that the Jaina works were carefully guarded in the Bhāndārs which
were a public property looked after by the whole community, while there
was no such arrangement in respect of the other sect. It is especially
noteworthy that several of the rarest Brahmanical and Budhhist works
like the Kāvyamīmāṁsā of Rājasekhara, the Tattyopaplavasimha of Bhatta
Jayarāśi and the original Sanskrit Tattvasamgraha were available only
in the Jaina libraries, At any rate, in Gujarāt of the Caulukyas and the
Väghelās there was a good deal of toleration and intellectual understanding
among the followers of both the faiths, which expressed itself powerfully
in the varied literary output and a remarkable cultural co-operation in life.
It was in these times that Vastupāla and his literary circle lived, and did
their work

CHAPTER II
SOURCES
39. Before coming to the life and works of Vastupala it would be proper
to mention the available sources which would supply the necessary data.
The historian of mediaeval Gujarāt is fortunate in this respect that he gets
copious material to deal with his subject. The data for the study of the
work of Vastupāla and his literary circle can be divided under three heads-
( 1 ) literary sources, ( 2 ) epigraphic sources, and (3) monuments. Literary
sources can be further subdivided into_(a) contemporary, and (b) later,
We shall examine here briefly all the three kinds of sources.
Contemporary literary sources
40. As poiuted out earlier, Vastupāla being a great patron of learning,
the poets and scholars who came in contact with him have left many
accounts of their patron, ranging from stray verses to the Mahākāvyas.
All those writings are highly iinportant not only for the personal history
of Vastupāla, but also for the history of Gujarāt, because the life of Vastupāla
was intimately connected with contemporary history. At the same time,
some of these works are fine specimens of Sanskrit poetry. In addition
to the Naranārāyaṇānanda Mahākāvya by Vastupāla, in the last canto of
which he gives an account of his family and of himself, we have the
following contemporary literary sources for the study of our subject. Among
the Mahākāvyas we get the Kārtikaumudī and Surathotsava of Someśvara,
the Sukītasamkirtana of Arisimha, the Vasantavilāsa of Bālacandra, and the
Dharmābhyudaya or Samghapaticaritra of Udayaprabhasūri. The Kirtikau-
mudī, the Sukrtasamkirtana and the Vasantavilāsa are the Mahākāvyas
based on contemporary history, having Vastupāli as the hero. The former
two works were written during the life-time of Vastupāla, and the third
one, viz. the Vasantavilăsa was composed not long after his death, and thus
the three works together supply a complete account of Vastupāla (ch. VI,
section I), though it must be borne in mind that after all they are ornate
poems, and do not give everything necessary for a biography as such in the
modern sense. Though the Surathotsava takes a inythological theme, it
seems to be a historical allegory, and has some bearing on the vicissitudes
of king Bhīmadeva II (para 75 ) under whom Vastupala first began his
political career (para 47 ); and the historical portion in the Dharmabhyudaya
is mainly devoted to the pilgrimages of Vastupāla as it pious Jaina (para
. 162-64 ) The play Hammīramadamardana ( between 1220 and 1230 A. D. j
of Jayasimhasūri is important for Vastupāla's political and military career,
as it dramatizes his strategy in repulsing a Muslim on-slaught (para 200-202 ).
The Revantagiri Rásu by Vijayasensūri, Vastupāla's Guru, and the Abu
Rāsa ( 1233 A. D.) by a poet who calls himself Pālhanaputra ( 'son of
Pālhana') are poetical works in Apabhramśal and describe Vastupāla's pilgri-
mage to Revantagiri or Girnār and his building of temples on Abu, respectively
(vide chapter XIII), The Prabandhávalī of Jinabhadra (1234 A. D.) is

Page 73****************************************************************************************
24
LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASİ'UPALA
also worthy of note, because it is the oldest specimen available of the
Praban lha-form (vide chapter XI ), and also because the author refers to
some incidents of Vastupāla's life, which have proved to be helpful in solving
important chronological problems ( para 129 ). There are two small poetical
Works known as the Vastupālaprasasti by Narendraprabhasūri ( para 122 and
216 ), one Vastupālaprasasti by Naracandrasūri (para 215 ), and also a Vastu.
pālastuti by Udayaprabhasūri ( para 214 )-all of them describing the good
deeds of Vastupāla. In addition to these contemporary compositions, there is
a host of others, which though not devoted to the life of the hero, give
important information in their Praśastis and colophons, and also by way of
stray references in the body of the text.
i prabandhastankalpa of cupala carita of
Later literary sources
41. Among the later literary sources, the most important are the
Prabandhacintā mani of Merutuṁga ( 1305 A. D. ), the Prabandhakośa of
Rājasekharasări ( 1349 A. D.), and the Purātanaprabandhasamgraha, a collec-
tion of several Prabandhasamgrahas composed in the 13th, 14th and 15th
centuries. The Vividhatīrthakalpa of Jinaprabhasūri (completed in 1333
A. D. ) is also worthy of note. The Vastupālacarita of Jinaharsa ( 1441 A. D.)
is a detailed biography of Vastupāla and deserves a close study, because though
composed about two centuries after the death of the hero, it supplies many
authentic facts about him, which are not given even by contemporary
authors, and is comparatively free from exaggerations. It seems that Jinaharsa
had utilized all the historical material which was available in his times,
bearing on the life and works of Vastupāla. The Upadesataramgini of
Ratnawandiragaại ( about 1461 A. D. ), the Prabandhapancaśatī or Kathākosa
of Subhasīlagaņi ( 1453 A. D.), and the Upadeśasaptati of So nadharma
(1447 A. D.) are the Prabandha-works of the 15th century, and all of them,
especially the first, contain much that is important for the study of the
cultural aspect of Vastupāla's life, and for his contact with several poets in
the capacity of a patron. Several Jaina poets have written in old Gujarāti,
poetical works called the Vastupāla Rāsa or Vastupāla-Tejapāla Rāsa, and
such Rāsas by Hīrānanda ( 1428 A. D. ), Lakşmīsāgara ( after 1452 A. D.),
Pārsvacandra ( 1541 A. D. ), Samayasundara ( 1626 A. D. ), and Meruvijaya
(1665 A. D.) are available. Though these were written a long time after the
death of Vastupāla, and in conventional pattern, some of them supply very
significant data about the personal history of the hero, which are not given by
any of the contemporary authors for one reason or another.
Epigraphic sources
42. As epigraphic sources we have a number of inscriptions of Vastupāla-
some of them very short, of a few lines only, while others comparatively long
like independent Kāvyas, most of which have been published in various
journals of Indology, and in collections like the Historical Inscriptions of

Gujarāt, Prācīna Jaina Lekha samgraha and Prácīna Lekhainālā. Most of
the inscriptions are found on Abu and Girnār, and a few on Tāramgā hills in
North Gujarāt, at Dabhoi near Baroda, Anahilvād Pāțan, Serisā near Ahmeda-
bad-these being places where Vastupāla and his brother had built temples,
and at Navum Samgapur? near Vījāpur in the Mehsāņā district. Though
Udayaprabha's Sukệtakīrtikallolini ( 1221 A. D.) and Jayasimhasūri's Vastu-
pāla-Tejapāla Praśasti are not extant as inscriptions, they are found from the
manuscripts. There are two inscriptions from Prabhāsa Pátan known as the
Sarasvatīsadana Prasasti ( 1272 A. D.) and an incomplete inscription from
Vanthali in Saurastra-which are of great value for the life of Nânāka, a
Brahmin poet in the literary circle of Vastupāla (para 85-89). It hirdly
requires to be said that all these inscriptions are to be treated as contemporary
sources, because most of them were written during the life-time of Vastupāla,
and though the Vaidyanāthaprasasti ( 1255 A. D. ) of Dabhoi composed by
Someśvara, and the Sarasvatisadana Prasasti were written after his death, they
are sufficiently near to his period to be considered as contemporary sources,
Monuments
43. Monuments are important for artistic and cultural history. Vastu-
pāla and Tejapāla had erected a large number of monuments at various places
in Gujarat and Saurāstra (para 58-60 ), but no trace of them is to be seen
now-a-days; only their temples on Abu and Girnār have been preserved. The
temple on Abu is a memorable specimen of mediaeval Indian architecture,
profusely decorated with sculpture of great excellence, and bears eloquent
testimony to the fine taste and great munificence of its builders.
1 The inscription at Navum Samgapur is the least known of all. It is a
fragmentary inscription of the Vāghelā period, which respectfully mentions
Vastupala and Tejapāla as ministers. Its text was published, several years
ago, by Budhhisāgarasūri in the Brhad Vījāpura-vrttānta ( Guj.), intro.,
pp. 2–8. The Baroda Archaeological Report, 1938–39 (p. 3), has taken a
notice of the inscription.
2 For a critical survey and literary appreciation of those inscriptions of
Vastupāla which deserve the place of independent Kāvyas, vide chapter
VIIT.

CHAPTER III
PERSONAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF VASTUPALA
Ancestors of Vastupāla
44. In order to assess properly Vastupāla's role as a great patron of
literature and art, it is necessary to narrate in brief his personal and political
history. There is no dearth of material on the subject, though sometimes we
get conflicting and confusing statements. Vastupāla and Tejapāla were born
in an aristocratic Prayvātı family of Anahilvaļ Pātan, We get authentic
information about their ancestry. The chronicles begin the gencalogy of
Vastupāla from a man named Candapa.? According to Vastupāla himself and
his friend Someśvara, Candapa was a minister. Most probably, he was a
minister of a Caulukya king at Analilrāð. His son was Candaprasāda, whose
hand was never without the ininisterial seal. He had two sons-Soma and
Sūra. Soma was keeper of jewels in the court of Sidhharāja Jayasimha.
His wife was Sītā," and she bore him a son named Asvarāja or Asārāja, who
also held some ministerial position. Asvarāja had married Kumāradevi,
daughter of a Prāgvāța Vaạik named Abhu, who was a Dandapati.? Ašvarāja
and Kumāradevī were parents of Vastupāla.
Vastupāla-son of a remarried widow
45. A tradition has come down to this day, according to which Kumāra-
devi was a widow remarried to Asvarāja. Merutuṁgas has noted this tradi-
tion for the first time, and three old Gujarātī poems called Vastupāla Rāsa by
Laksmīsāgara, Pārsvacandra® and Meruvijayało have confirmed it. C. D.
Dalall and M. D. Desai+2. have, hoivever, refused to accept the tradition as
authentic on the ground that none of the contemporary works has mentioned
it. Here is an interesting problem of historical method. Generally speaking,
contemporay accounts are to be regarded as more trustworthy than writings
of later date. But there may be certain matters about a person on which the
contemporaries would prefer to remain silent, especially on matters which are
not quite complimentary either to the person concerned or to his family, and
therefore such matters would not be mentioned by those who are more
concerned with praising him rather than presenting a critical account of his
life. This may be the reason why the remarriage of Kumāradevī, the mother

of Vastupāla, may not have been mentioned by the contemporaries; later
writers, however, would not feel the saine scruples or hesitancy which the
contemporaries felt. And hence we cannot reject this tradition merely on the
ground that it was not mentione:1 by contemporary authors. Merutuſga who
wrote his work only about six decades after the death of Vastupāla anıl one of
whose aims is to eulogize the great men of Jaina religion, would not mention
it but for its authenticity. Later Rãsas which have narrated the account of
Kumāradevi's remarriage have not copied Meruturga, but they seem to have
followed entirely independent sources, which shows that there inust have been
other evidence for the fact. The Vīravamśāvali, an old Gujarāti genealogy
of Jaina teachers, supports the tradition in a slightly different inanner.” If it
was not a fact that Vastupāla was the son of a remarried widlow, the tradition
would not have found such a wide currency after his death.
Brothers and sisters of Vastupāla
46. Kumāradevī and Asvarāja had elevan issues in all-seven (laughters
named Jālhu, Māu, Sāu, Dhanadevī, Sohagā, Vaiju and Padmaladevi, and
four sons named Luniga, Malladeva, Vastupāla and Tejapāla. Out of these
four brothers Luniga died at an early age, and Malladeva expired in
youth after becoming father of a son, Pūruasimha. Even though we have
plenty of information about Vastupāla, we have no means of finding out the
date of his birth. The earliest date that we find recorded is V. S. 1249 (1193
A. D.),4 given in an inscripton without date, but epigraphically not later than
Vastupāla's period, preserved in the Watson Museum at Rajkot. According
to the inscription, Vastupāla and his younger brother Tejapāla had made
the pilgrimage to Satruñjaya with their father in that year. It may be assum-
ed that this was in their childhood. l'astupāla had two wives--Lalitā and
Sokhu or Vayajalladevī, and Tejapāla was married to Anupamā, who is fanious
as a wise counsellor of both the brothers, an) to the less known Suhavadevī.
Beginning of political career
47. Very little is known about the early life of Pastupāla and Tejapäla.
In early childhood they were living with their father in a town called
Sumhālakapura which was given to him as areward for services to the Caulukya
king. After the death of Aśvarāja, the two brothers with their mother went

sought the precedent for widow-remarriage in the fact that Adināthis, the
first Tirthainkara häd married & widow, and hence they say that others
also could follow the ancient custom (JSS, Vol. III, pp. 113 and 118).
2 This work adds that the division in Vrdhhasākhā and Laghusakhā ( mud.
Visā and Daśā ) of the Vaņik community of Gujarāt-especially among
the Prāgvātas-began witli this incident, which was against the prevalent
custom. Those who were with Vastupāla became Layhuśākbiya, i. e.
inferior. Vide JSS, Vol. III, pp. 36–37 of the text.

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĂMÁTYA VASTUPĀLA
to Mawlalīt (modern Māndala near Viramgām) when we have no means of
ascertaining, lived there until the death of their mother, after which they seem
to have begun their political career. While returning from a pilgrimage to
Sutruñjaya they came to Dhavalakka. The Kirtikaumudi, the Vasantavilāsa,
the Prabandhacintămani, and the Prabandhakośa mention that the two brothers
had gone to Dhavalakka and Vīradhavala had made their appointment, after
they were introduced to him by Someśvara. The Sukrtasaṁkīrtana (canto
introduced to him he comedordan
IV), the Vastupāla-Tejapālaprasasti of Jayasimhasūri (verse 5 I ), and the
Sukrtakīrtikallolini of Udayaprabha (verses 118-19), on the other hand,
inform us that they were already in the service of Bhīmadeva II of Anahilvāò,
and that he had given them to Vīradhavala at his request. Vastupāla's own
statement at the end of the Naranārāyaṇānanda, however, removes all doubts
and makes it quite clear that he was first under Bhīmadeva, and his services
were lent to the court of Dhavalakka only afterwards. We do not know when
Vastupāla joined the service of Bhīma, but it is certain that he and his brother
were appointed at Dhavalakka in 1220 A, D. (V. S. 1276). It was after this
that their great career began, which made its mark in almost all the fields of
life.
Economic and political consolidation of the Gujarāt kingdom
48. While Bhīmadeva II was struggling hard to maintain his central
authority, the Vāghelās who formed a branch of the Caulukyas sprung from
Anāka or Arņorāja, the son of the sister of Kumārapāla's mother, were becom-
ing stronger roundabout Dhavalakka, which was their capital. In return for
services to Kumārapāla, Ānāka had received the village of Vyāghrapalli or
Vāghela; about 10 miles south-west of Aụahilavāų. And hence the name
Vághelās given to his discendents. Anāka survived Kumārapāla, and served
also under Bhimadeva II, and strove until death to re-establish the glory of
the Caulukya kingdom. Anāka's son was Lavaņaprasāda, and his son was
Vīradhavala. It seems probable from the account given in the sources that
for a time these father and son-Lavaņaprasāda and Viradhavala were ruling at
Dhavalakka. Bhimadeva II, who is known in history as Bholo or simpleton,
was a weak sovereign, and he was unable to protect his kingdom from the
depredation of his feudatories as well as the foreign enemies, and there was a
time when a chieftain named Jayantasimha could usurp the throne of
Anahilavād for some time, about 1224 A. D. (V. S. 1280 ), and issue the grants
in his own name. Naturally, Bhima must have been compelled to abandon

usurping Cupto the end of their leading supporters et
turn the upto the end of twahilavād, and remain te
his throne and take refuge somewhere. To regain the lost splendour of his
kingdom, Bhima had made Lavanaprasāda his Sarvesvara or vice-regent,
and it is to his credit and that of his son Vīrad havala that though they became
all-powerful in the kingdom and became successful for the time being to
re-establish the the glory of Anahilavād, they themselves did not think of
usurping the throne of Anahilavād, and remained Mahamandalesvaras and
Rāņakas upto the end of their life, though they could have easily become in
turn the Mahārājādhirājas. Leading supporters of both . Lavaṇaprasāda and
Vîradhavala were their ministers Vastupāla and Tejapāla, who bys their valour
and statesmanship spread the power of the Vāghelās in the entire region between
the rivers Sabarmati and Narmadā, and having established peace and order in
the whole of Gujarat made the country secure from disruptive forces.
49. It appears from the Prabandhas that after his appointment Vastupāla
was placed as the governor of Stambhatīrtha or Cambay, and Tejapāla
was in charge of the ministerial seal. Vastupāla redressed many of
the wrongs committed by previous governers. During his administration
there was a marked improvement in the moral tone of the people, a
check was placed on unscrupulous people making money by base means,
and all people carried on their business honestly in security. He put an
end to piracy (KK, IV. 16). He checked corruption with a strong
hand and overhauled the whole administration. He took a fine of
2100 drammas from an old corrupt officials There were great arrears in
state-revenue; he employed the four means mentioned in the Nītiśāstra to
reclaim the arrears and made the state-treasury full. He checked accounts
of several high officers in Stambhatīrtha, who were reluctant to make a suitable
report, and punished them. He also punished several unjust headmen of
the villages roundabout Stambhatīrtha and erected temples with money
recovered from them. Thus he put an end to the Mātsya Nyāya prevailing
in the state (VC, IV. 40), and curbed the laxity of officials, both high and
low, with commendable sternness. It is quite possible that the war-like deeds
of Vastupāla and his brother were mostly undertaken with a view to ending
the law of jungle and restoring confidence ainong the people, as well as with
the aim of filling the coffers of the state which had become quite empty
during the weak rule of Bhīmadeva. The Vastupālacarita states that in
punishing Sadik or Said, a wealthy Muslim merchant of Stambhatīrtha (see
para 59), Vastupāla's aiin was to show that now there was no place for

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASI UPÄLA
the Mātsra Nyāya. In short, the first work of Vastupala after coming
to power wils to secure the economic as well as political consolidation
of the Gujarīt kinglom.
Victory over S'amkha
50. When Vastupāla had succeeded in restoring peace in the region
rounılabout Dhavalakka and Stambhatirtha, Samkha, the ruler of Lāta, made
an attack on him, claiming that the port of Stambhatīrtha was a possession of
the king of Lāța. After a fierce fight, at a place called Vațakūpa (or Vadavā)
nezir Stainbhatīrtha, Samkha found Vastupāla to be more than a match for him
anıl male a hasty retreat. To commemorate this victory the citizens of Stam-
bhutirtha celebrated a festival in the shrine of the goddess Ekallavīrā, which
was outside the town., and the minister went there to pay his homage to the
deity. This incident must have occurred before 1223 A. D. (V. S. 1279),
because in that year Vastupāla entrusted the governorship of Stambhatirtha
to his son Jayantasimha or Jaitrasimha3 after overhauling the administration
of that city, which was the principal port of Nothern India and hence a place
of great importance from the economic and commercial point of view.
Treaty with the Yādava king of Devagiri
51. Another time of peril was the joint attack of Yādava Simhana or
Simghana of Davagiri from the south and four Mārvādī rulers from the
north. Lavanaprasāda and Virad havala went to meet the enemy, but with
the powerful invader in front and a combination of four hostile kings
in the rear the position was indeed critical. But Lavanaprasāda and his son
did not lose courage and fought valiantly. In the end there was a truce with
the four chiefs from Márvād, as well as with the Yādava king from Devagiri.5
Text of the treaty with Simhaụa preserved in the Lekhapadhhati, a work
giving different documentary forms, mentions the date as 1232 A. D. (V. S.
I 288 ); if we take it as correct-and we may, as there is no evidence to the
contrary-it may be said that the fight with Simhaņa must have ended in
that year.
Other warlike deeds of Vīradhavala and his ministers
52. The Prabandhas describe several other warlike deeds of Viradhavala
and his two ministers. First of all, they conquered the rulers of Vāmana-
sthali (modern Vanthali near Junāgadh), Sāṁgana and Cāmunda, who were
the brothers of Vīradhavala's queen Jayataladevi, who declined to pay
homage to Vīradhavala inspite of repeated entreaties from their sister. They
were slain in a combat and the great riches of the palace of Vāmanasthali came
into the hands of Viradhavala. Vīradhavala led another attack against

Bhimasimha of the Pratihāra clan ruling at Bhadreśvara in Cutch, but
as Bhīmasimha was served by several powerful warriors who had come from
Mārvād, Vīradhavala could not conquer him, but had to return after making
a peace-treaty. By this treaty a new friend was made and the Cuth border
became free from danger. After this, Virachavala thought of subduing
Ghūghula, a chief ruling at Godraha ( imodern Godhrā) in the Mahītaţa region
or the banks of the river Mahī. Ghūghula had made an alliance with the
Māryād kings when the latter attacked Gujarāt, and was plundering the
merchants, pilgrims and caravans coming to and going from Gujarīt. Tejapāla
was sent with a strong force. He captured Glūghula and put him in a
wooden cage and appointed one of his lieutenants as a governor of Golraha.
Ghūghula, unable to bear this insult, committed suiciilo bi biting his
tongue. As a result of this victory power of the Vighclás extended
upto the eastern border of Gujarāt, and the trade-route to Mālvãī was again
made secure.
How a Muslim attack was repulsed
53. There is ample historical evidence to show that during the rule of
Vīradhavala, there was a Muslim attack on Gujarāt, and that it was success-
fully repulsed by the strategy of Vastupāla. Jayasimhasūri has drainatized
this event in his Sanskrit play Hammīramadamardana. The Prabindhakosa
describes how Sultan Mojdīn of Delhi had invaded Gujarāt, and how he
was encircled by Dhārāvarsa of Candrávatī from the north and Vastupāla
from the south after his army had entered a mountain pass near Abu.3
Consequently the Sultān had to retreat. After some time the Sultan's
mother (according to the Prabandhacintamani, his teacher) was going on
a pilgrimage to the holy Mecca, and had come to a port of Gujarāt, most
probably Stambhatīrtha, to take a boat. Vastupāla ordered his men to
take possession of the old woman's property. The captain of the ship came
and complained before Vastupāla that the pirates had robbed the old woman,
Vastupāla caught the pirates who were really sent by him, and returned the
old woman's property after receiving her with great respect, and also
provided for her comfort and safety. While returning from Mecca, she took
Vastupāla with her to Delhi, and introduced him to the Sultān. Vastupāla
obtained a promise from the Sultan to keep friendship with Víradhavala, and
1 PK, pp. 104 ff.; VC, ch. II.
2 PK, pp. 107 f.; VO, ch. III.
3 PK, p. 117.
4 There is some controversy about the identification of Mojdin or Muizu-
ddin, as no Sultān bearing that name sat on the throne of Delhi. The
BG ( Vol. I, pt. I, p. 201 ) considers Mojdin to be Muhammad Glorī.
Prof. R. C. Parikh has identified him with Shāhabuddin Ghori (JSS,
Vol. III, pp. 153 ff.). Pandit G. H, Oza ( Rājputāne kā Itibās, Vol. I,
pp. 467 f.), Mr. D, K, Shastri (GMRI, Vol. II, pp. 380 f.) and myself
('Gujarātī, Divālī number, A. D. 1934, pp. 18 f.) have identified him with
Sultan Altamash (1210-1235 A. D.) of Delhi, and that seems to be the
most natural identification on chronological grounds.

thus made his kingdom safe. Coming back from Delhi Vastupāla was received
by Vīradhavala with great honour. As the play Hammīramadamardana,
depicting the victory of Vastupāla over the Muslim ruler was copied down
in 1230 A. D. (1 286 V. S.), this event must have occurred between 1220
and 1230 A. D. (1276 and 1286 V. S.), the date of commencement of
Vastupāla's ministry and the date of the manuscript of the play preserved
in the Jesalmer Bhāņdār, respectively.
Death of Viradhavala and Vastupāla
54. King Viradhayala died in 1238 A. D. His popularity has created
a tradition that a large number of people burnt themselves on his funeral pyre;
and Tejapāla had to come to the creamation ground with army to check
others from doing so. Viradhavala had two sons—Pratāpamalla and
Visaladeva. Pratāpamalla had died during the life-time of Vīradhavala,
leaving a son, Arjunadeva, after him. Vīsaladeva, the younger son of
Viradhavala, came to throne in 1238 A. D. Vistupāla died in 1240 A. D.
( 1296 V. S.), only two years after Visaladeva's coming to throne. Both the
Prabandhakośa and the Vastupālacarita? have given 1242 A. D. (1298
V. S.) as the date of Vastupāla's death, and it was generally believed to be
correct. But the Vasantavīlāsa Mahākāvya of the contemporary Bālacandra
has the date of his death as sunday the fifth day of the bright half of the
month Maglia in the year 1296 V. S. (Ist January, 1240 A. D.). This

3 BG, Vol. I, pt. I, p. 203. Also vide the Rājāvali Koşthaka in the appen-
dix to the Šatruñjayatirthodhhāraprabandha, Bühler has given the date as
1295 V. S. (IA, Vol. VI, p. 213). It may be noted here that we do not
know anything about the death of Lavaņaprasād. The BG ( Vol. I, pt. I,
p. 200 ) has assumed that Lavaņaprasāda abdicated in favour of Viradha-
vala in the year 1232 A. D., after the conclusion of the treaty with
Sim haņa of Devagiri. Others think that perhaps he might have died by
that year (GMRI, Vol. II, p. 389). The Rājāvalikosthaka begins the rale
of Viradhavala from 1282 V.S. (1226 A. D.). On the whole, it seems
plausible that Lavapaprasāda died between 1232 and 1238 A. D.
4 PC, p. 105.
5 The Prabandhas give an account of Vīrama, Viradhavala's son, and his
attempt to capture the throne (PK, pp. 124 f.). It is said that his
attempt failed and Visaladeva could come to the throne only because of
Vastupāla's help. But it is proved now that Viradhavala had no son
called Virama, and hence the story given in the Prabandha is not to be
relied upon (GMRI, Vol. II, pp. 390 ff.).

of Vastupala's 125 ) and the Vivientioned in the
statement is also supported by the dates in a palm-leaf manuscript, which
mentions that Vastupāla died in 1296 V. S. and Tejapāla in 1304 V, S.
(1248 A. D.). The Prabandhas say that Vastupāla expired in the village
Amkevāliã (situated 10 miles south-east of Wadhvan in Saurāṣtra), while he
was going on his last pilgrimage to Satruñjaya. The statement may be
reliable, but we do not find it mentioned in the Vasantavilāsa. The
Prabandhakośa (p. 125) and the Vividhatīrthakalpa (p. 80) refer to the loss
of Vastupāla's ministerial power in favour of the Nāgara minister Nāgada.
Elsewhere it is said that Vastupāla had incurred the anger of Visaladeva,
because of the punishment meted by the former to a maternal uncle of the
king, as that man had insulted a Jaina Sādhu, but the minister was saved by
the intervention of Someśvara. It is also mentioned that once Vīsaladeva
demanded from Vastupāla the accounts of the state-revenue, and finding that
some of the money was spent after temples etc., decided to punish him, but
here also the king was held back by Someśvara. Though we may not
accept such stories in their entirety, they can be considered as indicative of
the fact that the minister had incurred the displeasure of the new king, in his
later life. There is nothing inherently impossible in this, as we know several
such instances in history, when a new king finus it difficult to pull on with the
old minister. But here, there is no evidence to show that Vastupāla was
actually displaced by Vīsaladeva, though he was no more on very good terms
with the young sovereign. It is not unlikely that this may have been due to
the machinations of Nãgara politicians led by Nágada or because Vīsaladeva
might have felt the old minister rather too overbearing to be tolerated.
Death of Tejapāla
55. There is a very trustworthy evidence to show that Tejapāla, the
younger brother, continued as the Mahāmātya or prime minister for a few years
after the death of Vastupāla, and that the king's displeasure was not so great
as to displace him from the office. In an Abu inscription of the third day of
the bright half of month Vaisakha of year 1296 V. S. (26th April, 1240 A. D.),
Tejapāla is referred to as the Mahānātya, which corroborates the above
statement that Vastupala died in the Māgha month of the year, and Tejapāla
took the charge of his office. In the colophon of a palm-leaf manuscript of

3 The VV, on the other hand, informs that Vastupāla ascended Mt.
Śatruõjaya and married Sadgati (or felicity), daughter of Dharma, before
Ādinātha. That is, in simple words, be expired on Satrunjaya ( VV,
XIV. 49-52). We do not know if this is a mere allegory or an actual
fact. It is probable that though Vastupāla died on the way to Satruñjaya,
Bālacandra may have described it otherwise to make the allegory of
marriage before Adinātha, poetically complete.

1298 V, S. (1242 A. D.), Lunasimha, the son of Mahāmātya Tejapāla,
is mentioned as the governor of Brgukachha.? In a manuscript of the
Acārāmga Sūtra of V. S. 1303 ( 1247 A, D.), Tejapāla is called a Mahāmātya
in power at Anahillapura. We get the first colophon mentioning Nāgada as
the Mahāmātya in 1310 V. S. (1254 A. D.), which shows that Tejapāla died
between 1247 and 1254 A. D. According to the Vastupālacarita, Tejapāla
died ten years after Vastupāla, and the Prabandhakośa gives 1308 V. S.
(1252 A. D.) as the year of his death. Thus the year 1306 V, S. (Vastupala's
death in 1296+10 years= 1306 V. S.= 1250 A. D.), 1308 V.S. (= 1252 A. D.)
or 1304 V, S. (= 1248 A. D., as given in an old palm-leaf manuscript; vide
para 54) may be taken as the year of Tejapāla's death. Unfortunately, we
have no trustworthy evidence, as in the case of Vastupāla, to choose one of
these three dates as historically final. In any case, it can be definitely said
that Nāgara Brāhmin Nāgada became the Mahāmấtya of Vīsaladeva only
after Tejapāla's demise.

CHAPTER IV
VASTUPALA-A GREAT PATRON OF LITERATURE AND ART
AND A MAN OF LETTERS
56. As can be seen from chapter III, Vastupāla and Tejapāla wielded
a great iufluence at the courts of Dhavalakka and Anahilavād, and they
consolidated the state of Gujarāt politically as well as economically. But
they are more remembered for cultural activities inspired by their splendid
munificence. They brought a cultural renaissance in Gujarāt, such as would
remind one of the days of the great savant Hemacandra, and which vied
with the cultural glories of Mālvā under kings Muñja and Bhoja.
Pilgrimages of Vastupāla
57. According to the Prabandhas, Vastupāla had made thirteen pilgri-
mages to Satruñjaya and Girnăr. In childhood he went to both the places
with his father Asvarāja, who was a Samghapati or leader of the pilgrims'
caravan. That was in the years 1193 and 1194 A. D. After becoming a
minister he led the Samghas more than once, and undertook the pilgrimage
of Satruñjaya and Girnār in the years 1221, 1234, 1235, 1236 and 1237 A.
D. He also went to Satružjaya only with his family in the years 1227, 1228,
1229, 1230, 1231, 1232 and 1233 A. D. The last pilgrimage, which he
desired to make, to Satruñjaya, but could not complete owing to his death
on the way, was begun in 1240 A. D., and has been described by Bālacandra
in the Vasantavilāsa Mahākāvya. The pilgrimage which he did in 1221
A. D. was probably the most important one, as it is the only pilgrimage
repeatedly mentioned in the Girnār inscriptions and presumably the same
one is described with remarkable accuracy and poetic skill in contemporary
works like the Kīrtikaumudī, the Sukrtasamkīrtana, the Dharmabhyudaya
etc., with which we shall deal in chapter VI.
Public works of Vastupāla
58. Even if we look to the account given in the contemporary literary
works, which may be safely relied upon, the monuments and public works
like temples, rest houses, tanks, wells etc. erected and sunk by the
ministers were very numerous. Even if we consider only the contemporary
evidence, keeping aside the later Prabandhas, there is no doubt that their
munificence and philanthrophy extended to a large number of places in the
whole of Gujarat, Saurastra and Mārvāų. Jinaprabhasūri and Rajasekhara
assert that their public works extended to Sri Saila in the south, Prabhāsa
in the west, Kedāra in the north and Benares in the east. This does
not seem improbable when we consider the fact that the scholars, poets
and religious men from almost the whole of India were coming in those days
to Ayahilavād and Dhavalakka, and were getting some patronage from Vastu-

pāla and his brother. Public works of Vastupāla were not limited only to the
Jaina religion which he professed. We are told that he also built hospitals,
Brahmaśālās, Mathas, Siva temples, and even mosques. There might be
some exaggeration in the later accounts, because places on which Vastupāla
spent wealth in public works are about 50 in a contemporary source like the
Sukrtasamkīrtana. That number we find greatly increased in the works of
Rājasekhara, Jinaharsa and Jinaprabha; and some of the details seem ridi-
culous, because they are evident exaggerations. But even if we look to plain
facts given by contemporary authors, th re is no doubt that Vastupāla was
one of the greatest philanthrophists that Gujarāt and perhaps India has ever
produced.
59. Vastupāla and Tejapāla spent a large amount of wealth after their
public works, and one would like to know where this wealth came from.
We already know that the two brothers came from an aristocratic family,
which was supplying statesmen to the state of Gujarāt, and hence they must
be enjoying considerable affluence. The Prabandhas contain stories as to how
they came to possess fabulous wealth. Though these read like some folk-tales,
it is probable that they contain germs of truth : When Vastupāla was appointed
as the governor of Stambhatirtha, a Muslim merchant named Said or Sadik
refused to accept his authority. When Vastupāla tried to punish him, Said
called Sankha, the prince of Laţa to his aid. But Samkha was defeated,
Said captured and his property confiscated. When this was reported to the
king, he ordered that all the valuables of Said should go to the state, but
assigned the dust of his house to Vastupāla. Much of the dust was gold-
dust and a fire turned more of Said's gold and silver to dust. Thus the bulk
of Said's wealth passed to Vastupāla.? Another account states that while
going on a pilgrimage to Jaina holy places in Saurāstra the two brothers went
to bury their wealth amounting to a total value of about one lakh, near a
village called Haļālaka (modern Haļālā near Dhandhukā). There, while
digging the earth, they got more wealth. Vastupāla asked Anupamā, wife of
Tejapāla, as to what should be done with this treasure. Anupamā replied
that "It may be kept on the peaks of the mountains, so that it may not fall
in the hands of some other person, as it has fallen to ours." And Vastupāla
and Tejapāla spent it in building famous temples on Girnār and Abu, and
leading Samghas to the holy place of Batruñjaya.
Abu temple-a memorable specimen of mediaeval Indian architecture
60. Advice of Anupamā has proved to be true, and no public work of
Vastupāla and Tejapāla has been preserved to this day, except the temples on
Abu and Girnār.4 The temple on Abu was built by Tejapāla in 1231 A, D.

(V. S. 1287), and it has Neminātha, the twenty-second Jaina Tirthamkara, as
the chief diety. Temples on Girnār were built by Vastupāla in 1232 A, D. (1288
V. S.). The Abu temple, situated in the temple-city of Delvādā, and generally
known as Luna-vasati in memory of Vastupāla's elder brother Luniga, is
one of the finest works of mediaeval Indian art, and of sufficient excellence to
immortalize the name of its builder in the history of art. This temple as
well as the Vimala-vasati, built by Vimalasāha, about two centuries before it,
are wholly of white marble, though no quarries of that material, except of
inferior quality, are known to exist within 20 or 30 miles of the spot; the
transporting and carrying it up the hill to the side of these temples must have
added immensely to the expense of the undertaking. Externally the temple
is perfectly plain, and one is totally unprepared for the splendour of the
interior. As Cousens remarks, "the amount of the beautiful ornamental detail,
spread over these temples in the minutely carved decoration of ceilings, pillars,
doorways, panels, and niches is simply marvellous; the crisp, thin, translucent,
shell-like treatment of the marble surpasses anything seen elsewhere, and
some of the designs are veritable dreams of beauty. The work is so delicate
that ordinary chiselling would have been disastrous. It is said that much of
it was produced by scraping the marble away, and that masons were paid by
the amount of marble-dust remained." "The pendent which hangs from the
centre of the dome of the temple of Tejapāla is particularly remarkable and
rivets the attention of every visitor. Colonel Tod justly remarks, the
delineation of it defies pen, and would tax to the utmost the pencil of the
most patient artist;' and he is secure in asserting that no ornament of the most
florid style of Gothic architecture can be compared with it in richness. It
appeais like a cluster of the half-disclosed lotus, whose cups are so thin, so
transparent, and so accurately wrought that it fixes the eye in admiration.'
The sculpture of the temples does not, however, confine to the representation
of inanimate objects; it exercises itself also upon the scenes of domestic life, the
labours of navigation and commerce, and the struggles of battle-field; and it
may be safely asserted that the student of antiquities, who should devote
sufficient attention to these bas-reliefs, would be amply repaid by a large
increase of knowledge regarding many interesting points in the manners and
customs of mediaeval India."3 According to the Prabandhas, Vastupāla and
Tejapāla spent eighteen crores and ninetysix lakhs on Satruñjaya, twelve
of the temple of Kālikā Mātā. The third one lies in the local archaeologi-
cal museum of Dr. Pandyā Abhyāsagļha. It is evident from the inscri-
ptions that the pillars are the remains of the palaces of Vastu pā'a and his
family-members (These inscriptions have been published by me; vide
FGST, Vol. IV, pp. 192 ff.).

spiritual welfare of Tejapāla's wife Anupamā and son Luñasimha..

crores and eighty lakhs on Girnār, and twelve crores and fiftythree lakhs
after the erection of the Lunavasati on Abu. There might be exaggeration
in these figures, but there is not the least doubt that a vast amount of wealth,
and immense labour must have been spent after the building of these monu-
ments, which bespeak extraordinary liberality and religious devotion on the
part of their builders. The chronicles say that not only was there no forced
labour, as was the case in the erection of some similar buildings elsewhere in
India and outside, but ample wages were being given, and utmost care taken
for the amenities of the artisans who worked there.?
Vastupāla - a great patron of learning and literature
61. Besides being a philanthrophist and patron of art, Vastupāla was a
great patron of learning. He had established three public libraries (Bhāņdārs
in Annhilavād, Stambhatirtha, and Brgukaccha by spending great sums of
money for them. His personal library was also very rich, and contained
more than one copy of all important Sastra-works. He was highly liberal
towards poets and scholars, and it has been noted in his case that like Bhoja
and Vikramāditya, he gave thousands to poets for the composition of one
verse or even for a half. Long and detailed accounts of his enjoyment and
patronage of poetry have been given in the works like the Prabandhakośa, the
Vastupālacarita, the Purātanaprabandhasamgraha and the Upadesataramgiui.
Because of his liberality to the poets he was called Laghu Bhojarāja or Junior
Bhoja. So many poets, both known and anonymous, had profited by his
liberality that Someśvara has expressed their gratitude in the following words-
सूत्रे वृत्तिः कृता पूर्व दुर्गसिंहेन धीमता । विसूत्रे तु कृता तेषां वस्तुपालेन मत्रिणा ॥
"Formerly learned Durgasimha had composed the Vrtti (commentary)
on the Sūtras (of the Kātantra grammar ), but the minister Vastupāla has
given Vrtti ( means of maintenance ) to the poets without any Sūtra.”
While giving patronage to poets and making donations in the cause of
learning Vastupāla made no distinction between a paina and a non-Jaina. He
donated ten thousand drammas to the Saiva Tīrth of Prabhāsa, and gave

great wealth to the Brāhmins having poetic skill. Such occasions were not
rare, but on the contrary, very numerous. And the Kirtikaumudi says about
him-
नानर्च भक्तिमान्नेमौ नेमौ शंकरकेशवौ । जैनोऽपि यः सवेदानां दानाम्भः कुरुते करे ॥
His tolerance of other faiths had become so proverbial that the Purātana-
prabandhasamgraha has the following verse about him-
बौद्धैवौद्धो वैष्णवैविष्णुभक्तः शैवैः शैवो योगिभिर्योगरङ्गः।
जैनस्तावज्जैन एवेति कृत्वा सत्त्वाधारः स्तूयते वस्तुपालः ॥
62. Moreover, Vastupāla was credited with a critical faculty which
enabled him to detect defects in poetic compositions by others, and to make
improvements in them. He has been referred to as the best among the
appreciators of poetry and art” (Sahrdayacūdamaụi). Not only did he
appreciate poetry and art, but also requested others to write religious and
literary works for his instruction and delectation. The Kathāratnākara of
Naracandrasūri and the Alamkāramahodadhi of Narendraprabhasūri were
composed at his request (vide para 119-121). Greater part of his leisure-
hours was spent in the company of literary men. He himself has said in the
Naranārāyaṇānanda Mahākāvya (XVI. 36 ) that he could devote his time to
the company of poets and scholars, because his younger brother Tejapāla
looked properly after the state-affairs. Inspite of the high position which he
enjoyed his modesty was proverbial, and amidst the manifold engagements
of state-affairs he found time to make a copy in his own hand of the Dharma-
bhyudaya Mahākāvya of Udayaprabha, a pupil of his preceptor Vijayasenasūri.
This manuscript, dated 1290 V. S. ( 1234 A. D. ), has been preserved in the
Jaina Bhāņdār at Cambay, and we are fortunate in having the handwriting of
such a great personality even after the lapse of more than seven centuries (cf.
colophon of the manuscript-e. $280 a T?? TET FindezetaEHETYTUTT FEO
aftales et sitarfETHETFOTEFT Chafe 11). There was hardly a notable scholar,
Jaina or non-Jaina, in Gujarat of those days who had not come in contact
with Vastupāla in one way or the other. And there is no wonder that we
find a large number of works written directly under his patronage or indirectly
under the stimulus of his magnetic personality.
Literary works of Vastupāla
63. It has happened many times in history that patrons of poets were
themselves poets. We have many instances of royal poets in Indian
literature. The name of Vastupāla also can be counted among such persons,
Just as he is praised as a patron of poets in the works which are the
sources of much of our information regarding him, he is highly eulogized
as a poet too. He is called 'Sarasvatī with a beard' (Kūrcālasarasvatī)5

and Kavikunjara and Kavicakravartin, and praised as a spiritual son of
Sarasvati. The Prabandhacintāmaņi (p. 100 ) and other works call him
wornament of Sarasvati's neck” (Sarasvatikanthābharana ). We are also
informed that he had studied from Naracandra the three vidyās, i. e. the
Nyāya, Vyākaraḥa and Sahitya, and also works on Jaina philosophy (para
118). His poetic name was Vasantapāla, which was given to him by
Harihara, Someśvara and other poets. This is the reason why Bālacandra
has given the name Vasantavilāsa to his poem giving an account of
Vastupāla's life. At the end of the Naranārāyaṇānanda, Vastupāla says
that his first poem was the result of an inspired outburst in the form of
a hymn in the praise of Adīśvara on the Satruñjaya hills. This . hymn
is none other than his Adināth Stotra. Vastupāla has also written several
Stotras like the Neminātha Stotra, Ambikā Stotra, and a short Aradhana
of ten verses. The Arādhanā is probably the last composition of Vastu-
pāla, because its first verse (a ai Pilato ) has been quoted by the PC
(v. 234 ), PK ( v. 337 ) and PPS (V. 202) as spoken by the minister
while on death-bed. The PC (p. 105 ) says that the minister did his
Paryantārādhanā or the last devotional act by uttering this verse when
nearing death in the course of his journey to Satruñjaya ; and it seems that
he had composed the Arādhanā during his last pilgrimage, while his health
was failing.
64. We also gather from the literary sources that Vastupāla was profi-
cient in composition of Sūktis. Someśvara, in one place, writes as follows
about this particular faculty of his patron-
अम्भोजसम्भवसुता वक्त्राम्भोजेऽस्ति वस्तुपालस्य । यद्वीणारणितानि श्रूयन्ते सूक्तिदम्भेन ॥
And Udayaprabha, in the first verse of his Vastupālastuti has praised
the Sūktis of Vastupāla in a simple but poetic stanza-
पीयूपादपि पेशला शशधरज्योत्लाकलापादपि स्वच्छा नूतनचूतमञ्जरिभरादप्युल्लसत्सौरभाः।
वाग्देवीमुखसामसूक्तविशदोद्गारादपि प्राञ्जलाः केपां न प्रथयन्ति चेतसि मुदं श्रीवस्तुपालोक्तयः ।।
1 In the Girnar inscriptions he is described as धर्मसूनुः सरस्वत्याः and शारदाप्रति-
TATTA:. Also vide KK, I. 29-
वस्तुपालयशोवीरौ सत्यं वाग्देवतासुतौ । एको दानस्वभावोऽभूदुभयोरन्यथा कथम् ॥
Vastupāla has used this epithet for himself in NN, XVI, 40. For laudatory
titles (Biradas) of Vastupāla, vide VO, VI. 133-34; also the Vastupāla
Răsą of Hīrānanda.
2 NN, XVI. 38. Just as Vasantapāla is a poetic form of the name Vastu-
pāla, it is not improbable that the form Vastupāla itself may be a Sanskri-
tization of a name which may have perhaps a rustic touch. I am led to
this inference because of the fact that the old Gujarāti Rāsas sometimes
refer to Vastupāla and Tejapāla as Vastiga and Tejiga. It is significant
that even to-day Vasto is a common name in the Baniã community of
North Gujarāt and Mārvād.

CHAPTER IV - VASTUPALA: A GREAT PATRON OF LITERATURE

Vastupāla has been quoted in anthologies, which shows that his poetic
fame had spread far and wide outside the borders of Gujarāt. His four
verses are found in the Sūktimuktāvali of jahlana, keeper of elephants of
king Krsna ( 1247-1260 A. D.) of Devagiri. Constant warfare was going
on between Devagiri and Gujarāt, but as a result of that strife cultural contact
got some impetus during the intervals of peace, and there must have been a
good deal of give and take on both the sides. In the Sārņgadharapadhhati of
Sarngadhara (1363 A. D.) of Sākambhari, a verse of Vastupāla has found
place. In the Prabandhas a large number of verses have been put in the
mouth of Vastupāla,3 as spoken by him on particular occasions, and it is
certain that most of them are his own composition, in view of his skill in this
particular branch of poetry. It can be imagined that he could compose
Sanskrit Sūktis on the spur of the moment on suitable occasions. In the Ābu
Prasasti, Someśvara has spoken highly of his originality in the field of poetry
and his strict administration in the domain of state-craft. Verses spoken by
him before his death, while he was on the way to Satruñjaya, express a deep-
seated religious fervour and a humility, which only the great souls can show
(PC, p. 105; VC, VIII. 571-74).
65. As remarked earlier, Vastupāla has composed the Naranārāyanã
nanda, a Mahākāvya in 16 cantos, describing the friendship of Arjuna and
Kršņa, their rambles in the Raivataka garden, and the consequent carrying
away by Arjuna of Krsna's sister Subhadrā. At the end of the poem (XVI,
33 ), he has mentioned his numerous Samghayātrās, and we know from other
sources that his first great pilgrimage was undertaken in 1221 A. D.; hence
the poem must have been composed after that year, Praising Vastupāla, who
did such remarkable work in various fields of life and literature, Narendra-
prabhasūri has given the following verse, which summarizes succinctly his
manifold achievements-
त्यागाः कुड्मलयन्ति कल्पविटपित्यागक्रियापाटवं कामं काव्यकलापि कोमलयति द्वैपायनीयं वचः।।
बुद्धिर्षिकुरुते च यस्य धिषणां चाणक्यचिन्तामणेः सोऽयं कस्य न वस्तुपालसचिवोत्तंसः प्रशंसास्पदम् ॥
66. It appears rather unusual to the modern reader that a man should be
simultaneously a great statesman and administrator and also a literary figure.
Such people are known to patronize learning, but one feels some doubt when
they are also credited with authorship of literary works. And such doubts
are not altogether groundless, because it is believed by some scholars in the
case of such famous kings as Bhoja and others that they are credited with the

authorship of literary compositions coming from the pen of their proteges. Is
such a doubt, then, not justified about Vastupāla's authorship of literary works
attributed to him? Doubts in such cases cannot be completely resolved, as
it is a matter of interpreting evidence. But one thing is, however, certain
that there is nothing inherently incompatible in a statesman and administra-
tor being also a literary writer. The case of Disraeli is well-known. But we
need not go to foreign countries for examples. The literary history of Gujarāt
as well as that of other parts of India suplies us with many such cases. Some
of them may be mentioned here. Visakhadatta, the famous author of the
Mudrārāksasa (5th century A. D.), was the son of Mahārāja Bhāskaradatta
and grandson of Sāmanta Vateśvaradatta, and belonged to a family of the
ruling class under the Imperial Guptas. Vatsarāja, the author of six Rūpakas
(the Karpūracarita Bhāna etc. published in the Gaekawad's Oriental Series
under the title Rūpakasatkam ), was a minister of Paramardideva, and his son
Trailokyavarmadeva of Kālanjara, who flourished in the 13th century,
Srīcandrasūri, the author of the Prākrit work Munisuvratacarita (1137 A. D.),
was a minister of Lātadesa before he joined the ascetic order; and this fact
has been mentioned by his brother Laksmana Gani, the celebrated author
of the Supāsanāhacariya (1143 Ac D.) at the end of his work. The names
of the great Vedic commentator Sāyana and his brother Madhava (14th
century), who were ministers at the court of Vijayanagar, are well-known,
They were great scholars as well as patrons of learning and their work is too
well-known to require any introduction. It was a tradition in ancient and
mediaeval India that the persons of eminent positions were also the cultural
leaders of their times, and it was their highest ambition after doing their life's
work to die in religious meditation, having renounced the worldly ties, just
as our Vastupāla had tried to do. So, as pointed out earlier, on grounds of
supposed incompatibility we are not justified in having doubts about
Vastupāla's authorship of the works attributed to him, unless, as in other
cases, there is some positive evidence, circumstantial or direct, which justifies
us in raising such doubts,?
1 While taking into consideration the cultural traditions of Gurjaradeśa,
one has to think of several other historical facts also, which are characteri-
stic of the province. We have already seen that in addition to the Brāhm-
ins, who were wedded to learning by their birth and profession, there was a
cultured section of the Prāgvāta and Srimāli communities in Gujarāt whichi
had inherited the literary traditions of Srimāla; and thus it can be said
that Vastupāla, who combined in himself the arts of statesmanship and
government as well as the art of literature was only continuing the trad.
ition of his own community. Both these communities-Prāgvātas and Srim-
ālis have produced not only merchants, but great administrators, generals,
builders of monuments, scholars as well as poets. To take only a few exam-
ples-Śrīpāla, his son Sidhhapāla and grandson Vijayapāla (vide para 28
-29) were Prāgvātas. Durlabharāja, the poet-minister of Kumārapāla,
who began Samudrikatilaka, a work on astrology, in 1160 A. D., was a
Prāgvāta (JSI, pp. 277 f.). The rhetorician Vāgbhata (para 30 ) and As-

· LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPĀLA
67. After making a study of the life and works of Vastupāla we now
come to the known figures of his literary circle. From the available biogra-
phical data about these persons we shall see how they came in contact with
Vastupāla and how they entertained him with their poetic compositons,
and in what way the patron appreciated their work. We shall also see how
some of them composed poems to express their admiration for him, and also
how some works were written on particular subjects in response to requests
from the patron. We shall find, moreover, how those poets and scholars
were having contact among themselves, and how they appreciated, helped
and sometimes rivalled each other. That these persens really formed a
circle, and were not merely casual visitors, will be clearly seen. But here
a question might naturally arise about the propriety of describing these
writers as forming the literary circle of Vastupāla, and not of the Royal court
of the Vāghelās. There is no doubt that these poets and scholars came
to the Vāghelā court, and sometimes received gifts from the king, as in the
case of Harihara and Nānāka and Arisimha (para 81, 87, 96); but it is
clear from the evidence, which will be presented here that these writers
cared to bestow praise on the Vāghelā kings only rarely, which indicates
that all of them were dependent upon Vastupāla, and it was mainly through
him that their literary efforts flourished. And hence we are justified in
calling these writers as the literary circle of Vastupāla. A study of the
activity of this circle throws a flood of light on the cultural life of the times
of Vastupāla and also it is very important for understanding the literary and
scholastic traditions of mediaeval Gujarát. We shall take these literary
figures one by one.
ada, the commentator of the Meghadūta and author of two Prakaraṇas in
Prākrit, viz, the Upadeśakandali and Vivekamañjarī, were Srimālis ( Peter-
son, Report I, p. 56; Report III, pp. 12 and 100). Jagaddeva, who was
given the Biruda or laudatory title of Lālakavi by Hemacandra, was the
son of a minister and a śrīmāli (Peterson, Report III, pp. 96 f.). Coming to
comparatively later times, we may refer to śrīmāli minister Mandana (about
1450 A, D.) of Māņdu in Mālvā, who was a great patron of learning and
himself a Sanskrit autbor of no poor merit (ISI, pp. 476 ff.). Several other
Vaņik communities of Gujarāt like Dharkata, Modha and Vāyadā also have
given their contribution to Sanskrit literature. To take only one instance
for each-Yaśaścandra, the author of the Mudritakamudacandra Prakaraņa
(p. 11 n.), was a Dharkata, and Yaśaḥpāla, the author of the Moharāja-
paļājaya (para 32), was a Modha. Minister Padma, who is credited with
the composition of several hymns (para 105), was a Vāyadā. There are
many more authors, who deserye mention, but these few instances would
suffice to show how both Lakşmi and Sarasvati received equal devotion
from the statesmen and náerchant-princes of Gujarāt.

-Vastupāla?
68. Someśvara or Someśvaradeva was a close friend of Vastupāla and
chief among the poets patronized by him. He was hereditary priest of the
Caulukya kings of Gujarat, and wielded great influence at the courts of
Anahilayād and Dhavalakka. When Vastupāla and Tejapāla came to
Dhavalakka, on their way back from a pilgrimage to Satruñjaya, they met
Someśvara (para 47 ), and in a short time they became such fast friends
that Someśvara introduced them to king Viradhavala. It was probably
after this that appreciating the capacities of the two brothers, Viradhavala
borrowed their services from Bhimadeva II. So it is quite likely that
Vastupāla and Someśvara knew each other at least some time before 1220
A. D., the date of beginning of Vastupāla's ministry. And I may hazard
a guess here that their acquaintance may have been earlier. Someśvara, who
was the hereditary Purohita of the Caulukyas, may have met Vastupāla at
Anahilavād previously. The impression that these two remarkable men
created upon each other may have developed at Dhavalakka into an admiring
friendship, which might be regarded as the real fountain-head of this last
political and cultural revival of Hindu Gujarāt.
Somes'vara and his ancestors
69. Unlike so many other authors in Sanskrit literature, Somegvara has
given a good deal of information not only about himself, but also about his
ancestors. In the last canto of his Surathotsava Mahākávya, called the Kavi.
Prasasti-Varnana, he has given brief life-sketches of ten of his ancestors, and
also supplied important autobiographical details. It would be useful for our
purpose to have a glance at the summary of that part of the canto. There
Someśvara says "There is a city of Brāhmins called Nagara,a where the
prescribed rituals are strictly adhered to, and where the Kali was unable to
enter, as it was purified by the three sacred fires-viz. Gārhapatya, Ahavanīya
and Daksiụa. Really speaking, it is a great place of pilgrimage. There all
the people recited Vedas, and even a child was not impure. It was fancied
that attracted by the beauty and purity of the place, Gods abandoned the
heaven and incarnating themselves as Brāhmins, resided there. In that city
among the Brāhmins of the Vasistha Gotra there was a family bearing the
Surname Gulecā. In that family a great Brahmin called Solaśarman was
born, who satisfied his ancestors with the Soma juice in the sacrifices' perſor-
med by him, and also by doing the Srādhha ceremony at Prayāga. He was

made Purohita by Mūlarāja, the lord of the Gurjara land, and consequently
he attained fame among the Caulukyas, just as Vasistha in the solar dynasty.
Even in this Kali age he performed the Vájapeya sacrifice according to proper
rituals. How far shall I describe his good deeds ? It is enough to say that
he used to recite the Rgveda, had performed a number of sacrifices, gaye food
to the hungry, and controlled his senses. His son was Lallaśarman, who was
the Purohita of Cámundarāja, Mūlarāja's son. The son of Lallaśarman was
Muñja, who became the priest of Durlabharāja. Under his priesthood,
nothing in this world was unattainable for Durlabharāja. His Son was Soma,
by whose favour the kings attained victory everywhere. Soma's son was
Amaśarman, who performed six forms of the Jyotistoma sacrifices and bore
sacrificial title of Samrāt. He was the. Purohita of king Karụa, the father of
Sidhharāja. The wealth he received from the Caulukya kings, he spent in
building the shrines of Śiva, digging ponds, beautiful with lotuses, and giving
donations to the poor. Once Karna had invaded the kingdom of Dhārā.
Realising that the Mālava army was being defeated in the combat, the
Purohit of Dhārā produced a Krtyā or demoness. But Amaśarman not only
protected his king by the power of his Mantras, but defeated the Krtyā, who
disappeared after destroying her creator. The son of Amaśarman was
Kumāra, who was the Purohita of Sidhbarāja. By the power of his
1 This must be the same Soma or Someśvara, who was instrumental in
getting admission to Apabilavad for the Suvihita Jains monks (vide
supra para 37).
. . It is noteworthy that in mediaeval Gujarat not only Vedic sacrifices were
performed, but they were popular. The tradition continued, at least, upto
the beginning of the 14th century A. D., when the Muslims captured
Aşahilavād. Candu Pandita (1297 A. D.), the celebrated commentator of
the Naişadhiyacarita and an inhabitant of Dhavalakka, had performed
several Vedic sacrifices like Drādaśāha and Agnicayana. By performing
the Vājapeya and Brhaspatisava sacrifices he got the titles of Samrāt and
Sthapati, respectively
यो वाजपेयय जनेन बभूव सम्राटू कृत्वा बृहस्पतिसवं स्थपतित्वमाप ।
यो द्वादशाहय(ज)नेऽग्निचिद्रप्यभूत् सः श्रीचण्डुपण्डित इमां विततान टीकाम् ।।
He also performed a number of Somasatras. Candu is the only commer-
tator of Sanskrit poems, who often quotes the Srauta Sūtras (Handiqui,
Naişadhīyacarita, trans., intro., p. 3). This shows how Vedic learning
fiourished in Gujarāt especially among the, Brāhmins from Vanagar,
Apahilavād and Dhavalakka. Dhavalakka, which was the place of Vastu-
pāla's activity became the second capital of Gujarāt not only from political
but also from cultural point of view. It would be interesting to mention in
this respect that the Tattvopaplavasimha of Jayarāśi Bhatta (circa 7th-8th
century), a unique work on the Lokāyata philosophy, was copied down at
Dhavalakka in the year 1293 A. D. This shows that dialectics was a highly
prized subject in that city during the reign of the Vāghelās, and even
study of the tenets of an almost forgotten school of philosophy like that of
Cārvāka was not neglected (R. C, Parikh, Tattvopaplavasimha, intro.,
pp. 1 f.).

blessings Sidhharāja captured the lord of Sindhudeśa, put into prison the
powerful king of Málvā with his harem, and taught the haughty chief of
Sapādalakṣa how to bow down his head. This Purohita of the Cakravartin
performed many sacrifices and dug hundreds of ponds. Kumāra's son was
Sarvadeva, who was highly proficient in the Manusmrti. Following the
tradition of his ancestors, he performed sacrifices, and satisfied the people by
giving donations, but never stretched his own hand to receiye them. Sarya-
deva's son was Amiga, who was a Vedic scholar. To him, who liked to do
good deeds, only two things were shameful-viz. to hear his praise from the
superiors and living in this prison-house of the worldly existence. He had four
sons like the four Vedas of the Brahman or creator. Eldest among theni was
Sarvadeva, who was a great scholar. Names of other three were Kumāra,
Muñja, and Ahada. Sarvadeva immersed the remains of king Kumārapāla
in the sacred Ganges, and satisfied the Brāhmins of Gayā and Prayāga by
giving them donations. He sunk tanks in various places, worshipped Siva
everyday, welcomed every Brāhmin, and consequently, he was praised in
every house. His brother, Kumāra, was free from greed. One day, at
the time of the solar eclipse, the king of Gujarat, who was Kumārapāla's son,
offered him many jewels, but he did not accept them, though pressed by the
donor. By worshipping the S'iva-god called Kațukeśvara, he healed the fatal
wounds of Ajayapāla, which the later had received in a battle. At a time of
famine, when the people had become emaciated like skeletons, he prevailed
upon king Mülrāja II to remit the taxes. Pratāpamalla of the Rāştrakūta
clan had made him his counsellor. Once the Caulukya king appointed him
as the commander, and by defeating the enemies he proved himself worthy
of choice. Once Kumāra fought with king Vindhya, the grandson of Yoso-
varman, the lord of Dhārā. Not only did he drive away Vindhya, but having
devastated his city called Gogasthāna, dug a well on the site of his palace.
He got great wealth from the land of Mālvā, and gave it away when he went
to Gayā for a S'rādhha ceremony. Kumāra defeated the invincible army
of the lord of the Mlechhas near a place named - Rájñisara or Rānisara; and
satisfied the manes by performing the rites with the waters of the holy Ganges,
He was proficient in the six Karmans of the Brāhmin, and always uttered the
sacred syllables- a: F:. He had shown his proficiency in the S'āstras when
performing sacrifices, and that in S'astra or arms when fighting in the battles.
He always bore the Brahmasūtra or sacred thread on his body, and Rājya-
sūtra in his heart, that is, he incessantly thought about the welfare of the state
and the king. Kumāra had an obedient wife named Lakşmī, who was
beautiful like the goddess Laksmi. She gave birth to three sons-Mahādeva,
Somneśvaradeva and Vijaya”. 2
1 As Kumārapāla had no son, we take the word 'son' (Kumārapālasya sutena
rājñā-v. 31) to mean his 'successor'. We are totally justified in this
interpreation, because just after this, Ajayapāla, the successor of Kumār-

y Brāhmin families was born in one of the alco It is evident from
.70. Thus Someśvara was the son of Kumāra and Lakşmi. He had two
brothers, one elder and the other younger, named Mahadeva and Vijaya
respectively. He has given the history of his ancestors ranging over a long
period of about 250 years from the days of Mūlarāja. It is evident from
this account that Someśvara was born in one of the most eminent, learned
and wealthy Brāhmin families of Gujarat. That family hailed from Vadnagar.
In addition to doing the work of the high priest of the king, some members
of the family, like Someśvara's father Kumāra, could fight and command an
army successfully. We can say, on the authority of the Amamacaritra of
Municandrasūri (1199 A. D.) that the same gentleman was the chief accoun-
tant of Gujarāt (Nộpāksapatalādhyaksa) for some time and that he had
revised and corrected the said work at the author's request. This would
not appear strange when we look to the manifold duties of the Rajapurohita
in ancient India, who was not only an expert in the Sāstras, but also
proficient in the Dandanīti or politics, and sometimes had to look after the civil
and military administration. We have seen above that Vedic learning and
rituals were highly prized things among the ancestors of Someśvara, and some
of them were, no doubt, great scholars. But it may he remarked here that
though Somesvara has given many interesting details about his ancestors,
he has said nothing about their literary works, if they wrote any.
Literary works of Somes'vara
71. After eulogizing his ancestors, Someśvara has mentioned a few facts
about himself in the Surathotsava. He says how contemporary poets like
Harihara and Subhața appreciated his poetry? By composing a work full of
poetic merits, and a play, within only half of a Yāma (one and a half hour),
he had highly entertained the members of the court of Bhimadeva.? . After
praising his own poetry, and also the poetry and munificence of Vastupāla
in a number of yerses (vv. 48-66), he closes the canto, which shows that
the author and the patron were fast friends before the composition of the
Surathotsava.
72. In addition to the Surathotsava, based on the Devimāhātmya in the
Mārkaņdeya Purāṇa, the poet has composed other works. The Kīrtikaumudi
Mahākāvya is a panegyric of the glorious deeds of Vastupāla and is very
important for the study of contemporary history and society. He wrote a
play-Ullāgharāghava, dramatizing the Rāmāyaṇa story. It was acted in

the famous temple at Dvārakā on the Prabodhini Ekadasi. We cannot say
with certainty whether the play with which Someśvara entertained the assemb.
ly of Bhimadeva II was this Ullāgharāghava. The Ullāgharāghava, as we know
from the play, was written at the request of the poet's son Bhallasarman,
and was performed at Dvārakā, as already pointed out. But this, however,
does not exclude the possibility of the Ullāgharāghava being identical with
the play mentioned in the last canto of the Surathotsava.
73. In addition to these, Someśvara has composed an anthology of
didactic verses called the Karnāmộtaprapā. No scholar has taken any notice
of the work uptil now. Rāmaśataka, a hymn to Rāma in one hundred verses,
is also a work of Someśvara, and was once very popular, judging from the
number of manuscripts of the poem and of its two commentaries- one by
Ekanātha and the other by some unknown author. The Abu Prasastio of
Someśvara bears the date of 1287 V. S. (1231 A. D.), the year of installation
of the image of Neminātha in the temple. The metrical portion in two, out of
several, Girnār inscriptions of Vastupāla are from the pen of Someśvara,? His
Vaidyanātha Prasasti, commemorating the reparation of the Vaidyanātha temple
at Darbhāvati, by king Visaladeva, bears the date of V. S, 1311 (1255 A. D.),
which shows that Someśvara lived at least for 16 years after the death of
Vastupala. Tlie Vaidyanātha Prasasti seems to be his last composition. One
more Prasasti was written by Someśvara, but no trace of it is available to-day.
That was the Prasasti of the Vīranārāyaṇa Prāsāda, built by king Vīradhavala
at Dhavalakka. It contained 108 verses. It can be inferred from the name of
the monument that it was a temple of Nārāyaṇa or Vişnu. No remains of this
temple nor any other building of Vastupāla have survived at modern Dholkā.
From his numerous composions on various subjects, it appears that Someśvara
was a man of liberal outlook. Though he was a devout saiva and sākta and

an adept in the Vedas, he wrote not only poems and plays praising Ráma,
but also Prasastis for the Jaina temples.
This Somes'vara is different from the author of the Kāvyādars'a.
74. Some scholars have tried to identify our Sonieśvara with the author
of a commentary on the Kāvyaprakāśa, known as the Kāvyādarśa, whose
name was also Someśvara. But the identirication is not correct, as the author
of the Kavyādarśa was the son of Devaka of the Bhāradrāja Gotra, while
our Someśvara was the son of Kuināra of the Vasistha Gotra, And hence the
two authors are different.
Chronology of Somes'vara's works
75. No work of Someśvara, except his inscriptions, bears any date. But
the upper or lower limit of at least some of those works can be decided on the
basis of internal evidence. A comparison of the Surathotsaya and the Kīrti-
kaumudi reveals a great difference between the style of these two poems.
In the former, the style appears to be more or less of the Gaudí type, forced
and obscure, and full of tiresome puns, while the style of the latter is of the
Vaidarbhí type, marked by perspicuity, and makes one believe that here the
model was that of Kālidāsa. One cannot with certainty view this difference
of style as a criterion of priority in time, but it tempts one to believe that
probably the work of the Gauļī style may have been earlier. This surmise
is further corroborated by the subject-matter of the two poems. The Sura-
thotsava is more or less an allegory of the political misfortunes of Bhimadeva
II and the re-establishment of his power at Anahilavād. We know from a
grant dated 1224 A. D., that by that time one Jayantasimha had usurped
the throne of Anahilavād (para 48). Naturally, Bhīma had to take refuge
somewhere, and he could regain his lost kingdom in 1225 or 1226-in any case,
before 1227 A. D. (GMRI, Vol. II, p. 359) through the faithful services of
Lavaņaprasāda and his son. The Surathotsava also describes similar
misfortunes of, and regaining of power by a mythical king Suratha (para
169-71), and it is quite probable that Somes vara inay have chosen the story
of Suratha as the theine of his poem on account of its striking similarity with
contemporary events, and that he may have written the work to comme-
morate the re-establishment of Bhimadeva's power, sometime about 1227
A. D. The Kīrtikaumudi (IX. 31) narrates the events of Vastupāla's life,
including the temples that he built at Satruñjaya, and on the reasons adduced
by Kathavate (KK, intro., p. 17) it was composed after 1232 A. D. Nothing
definite can be said about the dates of the Karķāmộtaprapa and the Rāmasa-
taka, though on the basis of stylistic improvements, I would like to consider
both of them as later than the Sarathotsava,

Stray verses of Somes'vara
76. The Prabandhas give a number of references and anecdotes which
bear upon Somśvara's relation with Vastupāla. All these cannot be taken at
their face-value, but a critical examination of them reveals that they are based
upon historical facts I have been able to gather a number of such references,
out of which some important and interesting ones may be mentioned here:
Once in rainy season Vastupāla and Someśvara had been to the port of
Stambhatīrtha. At that time horses imported from some foreign country
were being brought down from the ships. Vastupāla looked at the horses and
gave the following Samasyā to Someśvara-
प्रावृट्काले पयोराशिः कथं गर्जितवर्जितः ।
to which Somes'vara gave a swift answer as follows-
STEPHframfetama 11
And he was promptly rewarded with a gift of 16 horses.?
On one occasion the members of the literary circle had assembled,
Vastupāla and Tejapāla were also present. A Samasyā was given-7: Pai ar
: Someśvara promptly composed a couplet and the seemingly
irrelevant words of the Samasyā became full of meaning-
येनागच्छन्ममाख्यातो येनानीतश्च मे पतिः। प्रथमः सखि कः पूज्यः काकः किं वा क्रमेलकः ।।
Highly pleases at this gift of ready poetry, 'Vastupāla gave Someśvara
a present of 16 thousand drammas.3
Once when Someśvara came to Vastupāla's mansion he was given
a seat, which he did not occupy. When asked the reason for this, he
uttered the following verse-
अन्नदानैः पयःपानधर्मस्थानैश्च भूतलम् । यशसा वस्तुपालेन रुद्धमाकाशमण्डलम् ।।
Having heard this the minister gave nine thousand drammas.
During one of his Samghayātrās to Śatruñjaya, the minister was wor-
shipping the Jina, when the supplicants ran towards him all at a time. Looking
to the crowd Someśvara spoke the following verse-
इच्छासिद्धिसमुन्नते सुरगणे कल्पद्रुमैः स्थीयते पाताले पवमानभोजनजने कष्टं प्रणटो बलिः ।
नीरागानगमन्मुनीन् सुरभयश्चिन्तामणिः क्वाप्यगात् तस्मादार्थकदर्थनां विषहतां श्रीवस्तुपालः क्षितौ ।।
The Prabandhas say that for this he received a large sum as a gift.
When Vastupāla returned from the campaign in which he defeated
Samkha, he was received by Someśvara with the following slokam
1 It is well-known that high-breed horses were imported in India from
foreign countries like Arabia (BP, Vol. XC, pp. 195 f). There were settle-
ments of Arab merchants in the coastal cities. Sadik or Said was probably
a wealthy and influential one among them (vide supra para 59 ),

श्रीवस्तुपाल प्रतिपक्षकाल त्वया प्रपेदे पुरुषोत्तमत्वम् ।।
तीरेऽपि वाढेरकृतेऽपि मात्स्ये दूरं पराजीयत येन शङ्खः ॥1
77. In addition to these specimens, the Prabandhas have quoted a number
of stray extempore verses spoken by Someśvara on particular occasions. His
praise of Tejapāla when the latter returned after defeating Ghughula, beauti-
ful description of the Lalitāsara, a lake built by Vastupāla at Pālitārā and
named after his wife,» laudatory verses for Vastupāla during the Samghayātrā
on Satruñjaya,+ verses in praise of Viradhavala when he held durbar after a
victory-- these are some of the illustrations in point. The Sūktimuktāvali of
Jahlana contains four verses of Someśvaradeva. Now, we know that there
were more than one pɔets of this name, and one is not quite sure whether
the author of these verses is our Someśvara. But considering the fact that
the Sūktimuktāvali contains verses of several other Sanskrit poets from Guja-
råt-like Hemacandra, Somaprabha, S'rīpāla, Vastupāla, Vägbhața, Vijayapāla,
Prahládana, Durlabharāja, Devabodhi or Devabodha, Kumudacandra, Arasī
Thakkura or Arisimha and also two verses ascribed to Jayasimha Sidhharāja,
the famous king of Ayahilavāà, it is quite possible that the said Someśvara-
deva is none other than our author. The probability becomes stronger when
we know that our author prefers to mention himself-as Someśvaradeva, just
as the compiler of the Sūktimuktávali has done. Moreover, the Sūktimuktavali
quotes two verses from the Vaidyanāthaprasasti, which is definitely a work
of Somes'vara. The anthologies seldom quote from inscriptions, and the fact
that the Vaidyanāthapras'asti is quoted that way shows that it was considered
a composition of high literary merit.10 It is interesting to note that a verse

Both Devabodha and Srīpāla were favourites of Sidhharāja, though their
relations were anything but friendly (R. C. Parikh, Kāvyānušāsana, intro.,

slab bearing the inscription, it has not been possible to trace out
these verses.
10 Auother inscription quoted in the Sūktimuktāvali is the Som anāthapra-
śasti, evidenty an inscription from Gujarāt (FTTTTOSTO etc.). As the
verse is not found in any of the extant inscriptions connected with the
famous Somanātha temple, it may belong to some earlier Prasasti of the
same shrine, which was repaired more than once.

from the Kīrtikaumudi (VII. 79. Farrês fafcatfoo ) has found place in the
Vasanta Vilāsa, an old Gujarātī Phāgu of the 15th century A. D.
Somes'vara abandoned the Vyāsavidyā after the death of Vastupāla
78. Somes'vara's verses in praise of Vastupāla, referred to above, reveal
the respect and admiration of a friend. Vastupāla has also paid tribute to the
scholarship, poetic merits and high position of Somes'vara in equally glowing
terms (in the verse quoted in the beginning of the para 68). According to
the Prabandhus, it was Somes'vara who had saved Vastupāla twice from the
wrath of king Vīsaladeva (vide supra para 54). When Vīsaladeva was
harassing Vastupāla and Tejapāla, inspite of their previous obligations on him,
Somes'vara readily composed a verse suggesting the ruler's ingratitude, and the
king was ashamed. The Prabandha notes that after the death of
Vastupāla, Somes'vara abandoned the Vyāsavidyā to mark his deep sense of
bereavement at the loss of his great friend, and refused to recite the Pūrānas,
though pressed by the king. And the king appointed another man named
Gayapati Vyāsa to do the work. There seems to be truth in the tradition
as we find Ganapati Vyāsa as the wiiter of the second Pras'asti of Nānāka
in 1272 A. D., in which he mentions himself as the author of a work called
Dhārādhvamsa, commemorating Vīsaladeva's victory over Málvā. It is
clear that Gaņapati Vyasa had become the court-poet of Visaladeva.
79. We do not know the date of Somes'vara's death, just as we do not
get his birth-date. He was living at least upto 1255 A. D., the date of the
Vaidyanāthapras'asti.

--Someśvara
80. Harihara appears to be one of the prominent literary figures of the
time, as Rājasekhara has devoted one whole Prabandha to him in the Praban-
dhakośa, and Vastupāla also held his poetry in high esteem. According to
the Prabandhakośa, Harihara was a descendent of Sriharsa, author of the
famous Naisadhīyacarita (circa 1174 A. D.), one of the most formidable,
yet poetic compositions in Sanskrit literature. It was Harihara who had
brought the first manuscript of the Naisadha to Gujarāt and it was at the

initiative of Vastupāla that the work got a wide currency in the province, as a
result of which the oldest commentaries of the work were written solely in
Gujarat.
Traditional account of Harihara
81. The Prabandha says that Harihara was a rich man, and came to
Gujarāt with a caravan of 50 camels, 200 horses and 500 men from the Gauda
country. While on the way, he gave food to the hungry with a liberal hand.
When he came to the outskirts of Dhavalakka he sent a man to the court to
carry intimation of his arrival, and convey his blessings to Viradhavala, Vastupāla
and Someśvara. Vastupāla and Vīradhavala vere glad that such a scholar had
come to their land and decided to receive him next day in a public
procession. But Someśvara became jealous, and did not show
enough courtesy even to speak with the n.essenger. Next day, Harihara
was received with great honour by the king and the minister and
was lodged in a mansion. Since then, everyday, Harihara used
to come to the court, where literary discussions were carried on. Once
Vīradhavala asked Harihara to examine the poetic merits of 108 verses
of the Praśasti of the Viranārāyaṇa Prāsāda built by him. The Prasasti was a
composition of Someśvara, and Harihara, who was angry at the apparent jealousy
of the court-poet, said "I have seen all these yerses in the shrine called the
Sarasvatikanthābharana Prāsāda, built by Bhojadeva in Ujjayini. If you are
not convinced of the truth of my statement, hear me; I recite all the verses
one by one." And he recited all the verses in due order. Viradhavala and
Vastupāla became sorry, and Somes’vara who was thus charged with
plagiarism became so much ashamed that he was not able even to show his
face. Sometime after, Somes'vara went to Vastupāla and told how wrongly
he was made a butt of ridicule. Vastupāla advised him to befriend Harihara,
and both of them went to Harihara's house. Somes'vara requested Harihara
to absolve him from the wrong charge of plagiarism; and Harihara accepted
to do so. Next day in the court, Harihara said that the goddess Sarasvatī
was pleased with him, and that he could recite 108 verses of any description
if he had heard them only once, and gave the example of the verses of Some-
s'vara's Pras'asti, which he had recited that way. To convince the king and
the courtiers about the veracity of his statement Harihara did show again
several such intellectual feats there and then. Vīradhavala asked Harihara-"if
such was the case, why did you accuse Somes'vara of plagiarism ?" Harihara
replied that he had done so because Somes'vara had insulted him. But after
all, the matters had become clear and both the literary men became friends
through the intervention of Virad havala, and Somes'vara's literary career was
shown to be spotless. After that the literary discussions in the court became
more lively, and at times Harihara used to recite verses from the Naisadha.
The Naişadha which was composed about 1174 A. D., was not known in
Gujarāt by the time of Vastupāla, and all became astonished by the poetic
merits of the work which was also full of scholarship. Once, when questioned
by Vastupāla, Harihara said that the verses were from the poem Naişadhą and
Somes varu astupāla ac comes vara 1 Haril
bly, the matters had done so because-se Somes vara

that Sriharsa was its author. Vastupāla asked for the manuscript of the work
and Harihara lent it only for one night, as it was very rare. Vastupāla got it
copied down during the night, and put it in his own library after binding it with
old strings and making it dusty by strewing scented powders over it. When Hari-
hara came next morning to get his book back the minister spoke, “I remember
that I have got this work in my library.” He told his men to bring the book
and the new copy of the manuscript was found out after some delay and
shown to Harihara. Harihara was astonished, and said, “This is your stra-
tegy. None else is clever enough to do this. You have punished the
enemies in a fitting manner, established the influence of Jaina, Vaisnava and
Saiva religions, and put the dynasty of your master on the path of glory.?
. Study and circulation of the Naişadha in Gujarāt
82. We cannot be sure whether the above account given in the
Prabandhakośa is quite accurate in its details. According to Bühler?
and others, the Jaina Prabandhas are composed on the basis of historical
traditions preserved and transmitted through the VỊddhaparamparā or through
a line of teachers, and there is every probability that the account as a whole
may be correct. It also throws some light on the atmosphere of the
courts, where a number of poets and scholais gathered together, and
competed with each other for royal or ministerial favour. There is no
reason to doubt that the first manuscript of the Naişadha was brought by
Harihara, and that Vastupāla was instrumental in the circulation of that
work in the literary world of Gujarāt, because the oldest manuscripts of
it are available only in Gujarat. Two palm-leaf manuscripts of the Naişadha
as old as V. S. 1304 ( 1248 A. D.) and V. S. 1395 ( 1339 A. D.) are preserved
in the Jaina Bhāņdār at Pāțan.One more palin-leaf manuscript copied
down in V. S. 1378 (1322 A. D.) is preserved in the Jaina Bhāņdār
at Jesalmer, and there are a few other palm-leaf manuscripts
without any date, at both the places. It has also been shown that a
copy of the Naisadha was put in the Bhārati-Bhāņdāgāra or the library
of king Visaladeva, which may be possibly from the original manuscript
in the possession of Harihara or from its copy which was procured by
Vastupala. The oldest commentaries of that celebrated poem are also
from Gujarat--one by Vidyādhara, known as the Sahityavidyādharī, and the
other by the famous Candu Paudita of Dhavalakka. The commentary
of Vidyadhara was composed probably during the reign of Visaladeva ( 1238-
1261 A. D.), as the author has commented upon the text as it was found
in the manuscript in the Royal library of Visaladeva. The commentary
of Candu Pandita was written in 1353 V.S. (1297 A. D.), according to

the author's own statement. The wide popularity of the Naisadha in the
scholarly world of Gujarāt within a century of its composition was mainly
due to Harihara's coming to Gujarāt, and also to the scholastic activities
of the literary circle patronized by Vastupāla and the Vāghelā kings like
Víradhavala and Visaladeva. The visit of Harihara reminds one of
the visit of the poet Bihlaņa, who had also come to Gujarāt from the far
off land of Kashmir, and had composed a play-Karnasundari Nātikā-
staying at Anahilavād, during the reign of Karya, the father of Sidhharāja
(para 38 ).
Stray verses of Harihara
83. According to Someśvara's statement in the Kirtikaumudi, Harihara
was a distinguished poet. If Harihara wrote any works they have not been
discovered. A number of verses ascribed to him are found in the Prabandhas.
His two verses in praise of Vīradhavala when the latter came to receive him
along with Vastupāla, his praise of Vastupāla when the minister gave away
to the supplicants the gold obtained from a golden staff sent to Vīradhavala
by a foreign king as a token of his submission, and his verses on the occasion
of the Samghayātrā of Vastupāla, are particularly interesting. The Sūkti-
muktāvali and the Sārmgadharapadhhati contain a number of verses in the
name of Harihara, but we are not sure whether they are the compositions of
our Harihara or of some other poet of that name.
84. We do not know exactly how long Harihara lived in Gujarāt, but
from the account given in the Prabandha it appears that he must have stayed
at Dhavalakka at least for a few years. The Prabandha says that once
Harihara went to Prabhāsa to pay his liomage to the god Someśvara or
Somanātha. But there, because of similarity in name he was reminded of
the rough behaviour of the poet Someśvara towards him, and at once burst
forth into two verses, one of which runs as follows and also contains the name
of its composer-
___क्व यातु क्वायातु क्व वदतु समं केन पठतु क्व काव्यान्यव्याज रचयतु सदः कस्य विशतु ।
खलव्यालग्रस्ते जगति न गतिः क्वापि कृतिनामिति ज्ञात्वा तत्त्वं हर हर विमूढो हरिहरः॥
And he gave half of his wealth to the supplicants and taking the rest
with him came to Dhavalakka from where taking leave of Vīradhavala and
Vastupāla went to Kāśi.

verse ? Co by Rājasekhara does not appear to be historically correct,
because both Someśvara and Harihara have praised the poetry of each
other (KK, I. 25; SU, XV. 44), and though their acquaintance had
begun with mutual jealousy, it had developed into an admiring friendship.
The Prabandha, as it can be seen, has put more emphasis on the tradition
of their jealousy.

85. Nánākabhūti or Nãnāka was born in an aristocratic family of
learned Brāhmins, just like Somes'vara and Harihara. He was a court poet
of king Vīsaladeva, and had also come in contact with Vastupāla. He had
established a Sarasvatīsadas or college of learning at Prabhāsa Pātan,
where the river Sarasvati falls into the sea. Two Pras'astis: recording
the establishment of the college are found, and a good deal of information
regarding Nánáka and his family can be obtained from them. The first
Pras'asti is not dated, while the second one bears the date of 1328 V. S.
(1272 A. D.), which is the eleventh year after king Visaladeva's death.
Even in the first Pras'asti Vīs:ladeva has been referred to as Tridas'asuhrd
or "the friend of Gods", which shows that he was not living. We can infer
from this that Nánāka was considerably junior in age both to Visaladeva and
Vastupāla.
Family-history of Nānāka
86. Nánāka's family was staying at Anandapura or Nagara (modern Vad-
nagar). He was a Nāgar Brāhrin by caste, and his gotra was Kápişthala. The
Praśastis begin his genealogy from a man named Someśvara. Sones'vara was
born in the village Guñjā near Vadnagar, which belonged to the Brāhmins of the
Vaiſavāpa gotra, as it was given in gift to some Brāhmin of that gotra by a
Caulukya king, who was pleased with the former's ministership. Somes'vara
was an Acārya and the pupils taught by him also became very learned.
He had a wife named Sītā and a son named Amața, who was an expert in
sacrificial rituals. Amața's wife was Sajjanī, and she bore him a son
named Govinda, who was learned like God Brahman. Govinda had two
wives-Lachi and suhavă. Suhavā was so full of excellences that no
efforts to praise her could do them full justice. In her company
Govinda paid off three debts, and having taken ablution in the sacred Revā

(ceremonial worship of Sarasvati) is done every year on the last day of
the Navarātri festival,

village Guñja must be a place of his maternal grandfather. Vide R. O.

entered the fourth stage of life. He had three sons. The eldest among them
was Puruşottama, who was a student of the Vedas. The youngest son was
named Malhana, who flourished at the court of the king, being proficient
in the six guņas. He had done a pilgrimage to Kās'ī, and could recite the
whole of the Rgveda. Govinda's second son was Nānāka who was wealthy
and was also a favourite of Sarasvati. Nānāka made a deep study of the
Kātantra grammar. He had a thorough grasp of the whole of the Rgveda, and
was proficient in the Rāmāyana, the Mahābhārata, the Purānas and the Smitis,
an expert in the Kāvya, the Nāțaka and the Alaṁkára. He was also a
poet, as the Prasasti mentions that Sarasvatí had resided on his tongue to
remove her bereavement caused by the passing away of her sons in the form
of ancient poets. He has been mentioned as an ornament of the Nagar
community (TFF: TUTTA:, first Praśasti, v. 23). The name of his wiſe was
Lakşmi, who was a jewel of both the families. His son was Gamgādhara,
about whose achievements the Praśasti is silent, but whom it gives blessings,
which shows that he was comparatively young at the time.
Nānāka patronized by Visaladeva
87. Vīsaladeva bestowed great favours on Nánāka. He gave Nánáka a
mansion in a locality of the Brāhmins called the Vīsalabrahmapurī built by
himself at Prabhāsa and thus made him a resident of the holy place. At the
time of worshipping Somanátha, Vīsaladeva had given him the town of
Vagasarā (modern Bagasarā in Saurāstra ) as gift. Nānāka, in his turn, used
to please the king by reciting the sweet texts from the Purāyas while the
king was alive, and satisfied him by doing the Srādhha after he became 'a
friend of the gods.' Vīrabhadra, the head of the shrine of Somanātha, had
given Nānāka the seventh share of the revenue of the town of Mamgala
Grāma (modern Māngrol on the southern coast of Saurastra), pleased by his
worship of Somanātha. Nānāka was well-known for his hospitality, and also
helped his friends and relatives with a liberal hand.
Nānāka-a patron of poets
88. Thus we get sufficient information about Nánāka, his family and
ancestors. His opulence and his love of learning were not the poetic exagger-
ations of a panegyrist, for we know that he established and maintained a
college. He was wealthy enough to patronise other poets; his first Prasasti
has been written by the poet Krøya, son of Ratna and the grandson of the
author of the Kuvalayāśvacarita, who was nick named Bálasarasvatī by the
people pleased by his Astāvadhāna powers, and the second one was composed
by Gaụapati Vyāsa, the author of the Dhārādhvamsa (para 78).
Nānāka's praise of Vastupāla
89. We do not possess any work from the pen of Nānāka, though the
Prasastis speak much of his poetic achievements. An ir complete inscription
from Vanthali in Saurástra? seems to be a composition of Nānāka, as the
author mentions himself as an inhabitant of Anandapura, gives Kāpisthala as

his gotra and mentions Govinda as his father. The last line has been inscri-
bed only half, and thus the inscription has remained incomplete, and we do
not get author's name. The date is also not known, as the first line is broken.
This inscription can be considered a rare specimen of the poetry of Nānāka,
The Prabandhakośa informs us that when Amaracandra entered the court of
Visaladeva ( vide para 103 ) his poetic faculties were tested by several poets
including Nānāka. Again, we get a further specimen of Nānāka's versificat-
ion, which is especially noteworthy as it is indicative of his contact with
Vastupāla : Once several poets were praising the generosity of Vastupāla, the
minister's head hanging down in embarassed modesty. At that time the
young Nānāka uttered the following verse-
एकस्त्वं भुवनोपकारक इति श्रुत्वा सतां जल्पितं लज्जानम्रशिराः स्थिरातलमिदं यदीक्षसे वेमि तत् ।
वाग्देवीवदनारविन्दतिलक श्रीवस्तुपाल ध्रुवं पातालाद् बलिमुद्दिधीर्घरसकृन्मार्ग भवान् मार्गति ।।
And the poet was awarded precious gifts.?

Yas'ovīra-a close friend of Vastupāla
20. Yasovīra was a close friend of Vastupāla. Someśvara has praised
both these friends in a verse by describing them as "two sons of the goddess
Sarasvati." Yaśovīra was a Vaạik and professed the Jaina religion, though
nothing is known about his specific caste. He was a minister of the Cohãņa
king Udayasimha of Jābālipura (modera Jhālor in Rajputānā). The Kirti-
kaumudi has clearly mentioned him as "the minister of the Cohãụa king”,
though it has not given the ruler's name. In the drama Hammīramadamar-
dana (V. 48 ) of Jayasimhasūri, Vastupāla has been represented as honouring
Yaśovīra as his elder brother. It can be said on the authority of the same
1 PK, 62. Here Nānāka has been referred to as the Visalanagariya or
coming from Visalanagara (modern Visnagar in North Gujarat); in
the same work elsewhere (p. 120) he is mentioned as the Mabā nagariya
or coming from Vadnagar. But it is evident on the authority of the
contemporary Praśastis that Nānāka was an inhabitant of Vadnagar, and
not of Visalanagara.
2 PK, p. 120. According to the PPS (p. 60), the sum awarded was 16000.
The UT (p. 65 ) informs that Vastupāla gave Nānāka a tongue of gold.
In a later collection of Prabandhas included in the PPS (p. 74) this verse
has been ascribed to Someśvara.

work that Yaśovīra had rendered considerable help to Tejapâla in
.making Vastupāla's strategy successful against the Muslim invasion (which
is the theme of the HMM), and that Yasovīra's advice was sought by Teja-
pāla on all important matters at that time, as Márvād and Mevā} were the
places of action (HMM, V. 47 and p. 54). The name of Yasovīra's father
was also Udayasimha, as is known with certainty from his inscriptions. The
Purātanaprabandhasamgraha has given Dusāja as name of his father, and has
also quoted some Apabhramsa Dūbās recited by the bards, mentioning him
as CHISE ( vide para 93 ); and this means that Dusāja may be another name
of Yasovira's father Udayasimha. Yaśovīra's wife was Suhagadevī; he had
five sons, out of which the name of only one, Karinasimha, is known.
Yas'ovīra's knowledge of the S'ilpas'āstra
91. Yasovīra was also known as the Sarasvatikanthābharana, probably
on account of his love for learning and his patronage of poets. Inscriptions call
him Kavindrabandhu,4 perhaps on account of his close relationship with
Vastupāla. Someśvara has devoted to him not less than four laudatory verses
in the first canto of his Kirtikaumudi, which also speak of his intimate
contact with Someśvara's patron. We get the description of his meeting
with Vastupāla at the time of the installation ceremony of the Lunayasati in
1231 A. D. Udayasimha, the lord of jābālipura, the chief of Nadul and Par-
már Somasimha of Candrāvati were among the royal personalities who had arriv-
ed to attend the function, and there were hundreds of officials from the towns
and villages of the Caulukya kingdom." Yasovīra had also arrived with his king.
Vastupāla welcomed him with a number of verses, and Yośovira, in his turn,
praised Vastupāla with two poetic verses. Yośovīra has been mentioned in
the Prabandhas as an authority on the science of architecture, and he was
asked to give an opinion on the architecture of the Ābu témple. Then Yos'o-
vīra drew attention of Sobhanadeva, the chief architect, to the following defects
according to the Silpas'ástra-"In the assembly-hall the broad passage between
the two female statues is altogether inappropriate in the temple of a Tīrtham-
kara, and is forbidden by the treatises on architecture. Moreover, this arch
over the door that leads into the inner cell of the temple, on account of the
two lions on it, altogether disturbs the worship of the god; and moreover, the

the temple, is fatal to the long life of the man who built the temple, That an
intelligent architect should have committed these irremediable faults is to be
ascribed to the force of actions in a former life, which must always produce
their effect.” And thus giving the decision Yos'ovīra returned to his place.1
Yas'ovīra-a poet and a patron of literature.
92. From his verses quoted in the Prabandhas it seems that Yośovīra
was a Sanskrit poet not devoid of merits. This is further corroborated by
the fact that the Kīrtikaumudí has compared him with the poets Kālidāsa.
Māgha and Abhinanda. But no work of Yośovīra has come down to us.
Being a man in an eminent position, he was also a patron of literature. In
a palm-leaf manuscript of a Sanskrit anthology of verses preserved in the
Samghavī pādā Bhāņdār at Pāța» (no. 52 of the incomplete section), I
saw several rerses in praise of minister Yośovīra in the section called
Sajjanaprašamsā or the praise of the good. As the manuscript is fragmentary,
we do not know either the date of composition or of copying or the name
of the anthology or of the compiler. But this is enough to show how
Yośovīra was held in high esteem by some poets. Jayamamgalasūri, grand-
pupil of Vādi Devasūri and author of the Praśasti of Căcigedeva on the
Sundhá hills in Rajasthān, had uttered the following verse, when Yośovīra
installed the image of Mahāvīra in a temple called the Candana Vasati
built by him at Jhālor-
__यत्त्वयोपार्जितं वित्तं यशोवीर प्रतिष्ठया । तल्लक्षगुणितां नीतं यशो वीरप्रतिष्ठया ॥
And the rhetorician Māņikyacandra (see para 129-30 ), author of a
commentary Samketa on the Kavyaprakāśa, thus praised Yośovīra on an
occasion
यशोवीर लिखत्याख्यां यावच्चन्द्रे विधिस्तव । न माति भुवने तावदाद्यमप्यक्षरद्वयम् ॥
93. Yośovīra was well-known among the Cāraṇas or bards, because
he patronized them with ample gifts. Several Apabhramsa Dūhās of the
bards recited in his praise have been preserved in the Prabandhas, and
they are important not only for the personal history of Yośovīra and
his patronage of the bards, but also for the study of the Apabhramsa folk-
literature of Gujarāt and Rajasthān, a valuable part of which has been preserved
in the Prākrit Grammar of Hemacandra, and works like the Prākrit.
Pimgala. When Yośovīra concluded a treaty with Visaladeva of Dhavalakka
on behalf of his ruler Udayasimha and thus made the latter's kingdom
safe, a bard uttered the following Apabhrams'a couplet
1 PC, p. 101. A further list of such architectural defects will be found in
the PX, p. 124. We are not sure if these lists of defects, in their
entirety, really came from Yośovīra. But we may say that he might have
criticized the architecture of the temple from the point of view of the
Vāstuśāstra, which points out not only artistic defects, but what may be
called defects according to rules derived from superstitious beliefs.

"O son of Dusāj ! had you been in Lamkā just as you are here, the

installed an image of Sāntinātha, the 16th Tīrthamkara, in a temple constru-
cted for the spiritual welfare of his mother, in 1232 A. D. (1288 V. S.) at
Madrī ( near Eranapura Road in Mārvād ), and had also built two Deva-
kulikās or small shrines on Ābu in 1235 A. D. (1291 V, S.). From the
inscriptions in these places it seems that Yos'ovira was a follower of the

95. Nothing is known about the personal history of Subhața, but his
connection with the literary circle of Vastupāla is attested by the fact that
Somes'vara has praised his poetry along with that of other poets of the circle
like Naracandra, Vijayasena, Harihara and Yos'ovīra; and that the Surathot-
sava informs us how Subhata and Harihara appreciated the poetry of Some-
s'vara (see para 71! Only a one-act Sanskrit drama of Subhata,
the Dūtāṁgada, which is called a Chāyānātaka by the author, has come down
to us. As is mentioned in the prologue, it was acted in Ayahilavād by the
order of king Tribhuvanapāla ( 1242–1 244 A. D.) on the occasion of a festival
in honour of the late king Kumārapāla. But when we take into consideration
the title of Kavipravara or 'the chief among the poets' bestowed upon Subhata
by Somes'vara, it appears that he may have written some greater works
worthy enough to justify that title. Subhata has also described himself in the
prologue as proficient in logic.

was a la Thetorician Amarear from his word in close co
other gifts, just like Somes'vara, the author of the Kirtikaumudī. According to
the Prabandhakos'a, he was a follower of Jinadattasūri of the Vāyada
gachha,” and as such he may be considered a Jain. Though Arisimha
was a layman, he was a Kalāguru or preceptor in fine arts of the famous
poet and rhetorician Amaracandra. Amaracandra held Arisimha and his poetry
in high esteem, as is clear from his works, and both the literary men, one
a layman and another a monk, worked in close collaboration. Just as
Arisimha had initiated Amaracandra into poetic art, it was Amaracandra
who brought the former to the court of Visaladeva. Once Vīsaladeva
asked Amaracandra, "who is your teacher in fine art ?" Amara said, "the
poet-prince Arisimha." "Then bring him to me to-morrow morning" ( answered
the king ). The following morning Amaracandra led the poet before the king.
The king sat leaning on his sword and asked, "is this the poet-prince?" He
answered, "yes.” Then the king said, "recite something suitable to the
occasion." Thereupon Arisimha recited four verses in which he praised
Vīsaladeva's sword. The prince was so charmed that he bestowed a
permanent appointment and a high salary upon the poet. Soon afterwards
the salary was doubled, because he described skilfully in a metrical form
a blade of grass which the king held in his hand.4
The Sukrtasamkirtana and its date
07. Poetic fame of Arisimha had spread outside Gujarat and a number
of his verses have been included in the anthologies like the Sūktimuktāvali'
and the Sārņgadharapadhhati. In these anthologies he has been ment-
ioned as Arasī Thakkura. Arasī is clearly the current form in Prakrit of his
name and the identification becomes all the more probable when we find
that in the Prabandhakośa his name has been spelt as Arasimha, the form
which is so near to Arasī of the anthologies. The Upadeśataramgiặi has
quoted a verse of Arisimha in praise of Vastupāla, for which, according to
that work, the former was awarded the sum of two thousand,? But most
remarkable specimen of the poetic activity of Arisimha is his Mahākāvya
Sukrtasaṁkīrtana written in praise of his patron Vastupāla for commemora-
ting his good deeds. Five verses at the end of each canto of this Mahākávya
are the compositions not of Arisimha, but of Amaracandra or Amara Paụdita.
It is stated, "in this work which Arisimha composed, Amara Pandita wrote
these four verses canto by canto." The number refers to the preceding four

verses and fifth which is repeated at the end of each canto is not reckoned.
The verses have no close connection with the contents of the preceding parts.
The first three either contain general praise of Vastupāla and bestow blessing
upon him or mention incidents not described by Arisimha. The fourth always
names Arisimha as the author of the work and praises his poetic skill; and the
fifth mentions the fact that the preceding four are from the pen of Amara
Paudita.
98. Evidently, the Sukrtasamkārtana was composed when Vastupāla was
at the zenith of his power. This is proved, for instance, by two verses at
the end of the first and second contos-
"Daily, illustrious prince of the council ! Vastupāla! the Brāhmins
call blessings on you, long may you live !' The chief bards, 'may you attain
the age of Brahman'; and noble women, 'may you never grow old, and be
immortal!' But I will also say something 'may you rejoice in your life as
long as your far-reaching fame dances in the sky" (I. 42 ).
"Heavenly ( wishing ) cow, the (paradise) tree, ( wish-fulfilling )
precious stones ! why hide ye yourselves in the tottering rocks of the divine
mountain (Meru)? Adom the earth; nobody demands you! May the
illustrious minister Vastupāla live for ever!” (II. 52 )
We are able to decide the upper and lower limits of the date of
composition of the work more precisely. It was written most probably
before 1231 A. D., to which year the inscriptions of the Abu temple belong,
because those magnificent structures are nowhere referred to in this work,
But it was written after 1222 A. D. (V. S. 1278 ), the date of construction of-
a niche of Mallinātha on Abu, which it mentions.
99. No work of Arisimha, other than the Sukrtasamkīrtana is extant.
From a verse of Amaracandra in his Kávyakalpalatā (I. 2),3 Bühler thinks
that Arisirha must have written another work called the Kavitārahasya, and
that it was a hand-book of poetry. It is possible, however, to interpret the
word Kavitārahasya in the sense of "the mystery or depth of poetic genius."
It appears that Arisimha was proficient in logic and dialectics, as at one place
Amaracandra has referred to him as "a lion for the elephants in the form of
rival dialecticians." But we do not know if he wrote any work on the subject.
100. The work of Arisimha leaves no doubt that both he and Amara
Čandra belonged to Vastupāla's circle of poets, which the Prabandhas often
mention. Amaracandra speaks thus in one of his concluding verses

It is clear from this that Arisimha and other poets were amply rewar-
ded by Vastupāla for their poetic compositions and that the information
regarding Vastupāla's patronage of literature derived from the later
Prabandhas contains a good deal of truth. Moreover, we may not put the
prime of the poetic career of Arisimha and Amaracandra as late as the reign of
Vīsladeva, but it appears certain that they kept themselves in favour at the
court of Dhavalakka even after the death of Vīradhavala and their patron
Vastupāla.

-Nayacandrasūri?
Amaracandra-à Sādhu of the Vāyađa gachha
101. Amaracandrasūri is one of the remarkable names in the history
of mediaeval Sanskrit literature, and he is best known as the author of the
Bālabhārata and the Kāvyakalpalatā. Amaracandra was a pupil of
Jinadattasūriof the Vāyada gachha of the Svetāmbara Jaina sect,
Váyada or Vāyatīya gachha has derived its name from a place called
Vāyada situated 15 miles north-west of Anahilavād. The presiding deity
of the place is Vāyu or the wind-god and hence the name of the place;
and the Vāyaļā Banias and Brāhmins of Gujarat, who are devotees of
the wind-god, have originated from Vāyaṇa. It was a custom in the Vāyada
gachha that the Acāryas had only three names, viz. Jinadatta, Rās'illa and
Jīvadeya. Thus Amaracandra's guru was Jinadatta, his pupil was Rās'illa and
the pupil of the latter was Jivadeva; and again there came an Acārya named
Jinadatta. Considerable information regarding the antiquity of the Vāyada
gachha and the Acāryas that flourished in that gachha can be had from the
7th chapter of the Prabhāvakacarita and also from the Pras'asti of the
Balabhārata.
Possibly a Vāyaļā Brāhmin before he became a monk

fore he became a Jaina monk. But it is not impossible that he was a Váyađā
Brāhmin, because inspite of the fact that he was a Jaina ascetic he has eulogized

2 This Jinadattasūri is the same as the preceptor of Arisimha (para 96).
He is the author of the Vivekavilāsa (circa 1220 A. D.), an encyclopaedic
work composed for the instruction of the Jaina layman. Amaracandra
says that he had written many other works (BBH, last canto, v. 30),
bat none of them except this one is extant. For Jinadatta's instruction
to Vastupāla, vide PC, p. 101.

Vyasa in the beginning of every canta of his Bālabhārata and has praised the
wind-god, the presiding deity of Vāyada, in the Pras'asti of the same
work. We also come to know that he had written the Balabhārata at the
request of the Brāhmins residing in Vāyaļa. The Hammīra Mahākāvya
(14th century A. D.) eulogizes Amaracandra as a Brahmajña or knower of
Veda, and the Kávyakalpalatã reveals Amaracandra's complete mastery
of Brāhmanical learning. Though Amaracandra became a Jaina Sādhu, it
seems that, he did not abandon his ancestral Brāhmanism in toto, We
get some more information about Amaracandra after his initiation into religious
order, though even that information is mixed with accounts of strange
miracles. It is narrated by the Prabandhakos'a3 that Amaracandra, the
pupil of Jinadattasūri, received the charm called Sidhhasārasvata from
Kavirāja Arisimha. By his chanting of this charm for twentyone days in a
secluded part of the mansion of the minister Padma, who was a staunch
follower of the Vāyada gachha, the goddess of learning appeared before
him from the disc of the moon at the midnight of the twentyfirst day and
gave him the boon that he would be a Sidhha Kavi or perfect poet, honoured
by all the kings. The Purātanaprabandhasangraha: informs that
Amaracandra had cured some scholar of a fatal desease, and the latter
gave him the charm called the Sidhhasārasvata. In any case, we may take it
as certain that Amaracandra was initiated in the art of poetic composition
by a literary man, in all probability by Arisimha, who was obliged by him in
some way,
Amaracandra at the court of Visaladeva; Amaracandra and Arisimha
103. The Prabandhakos'a notes that after this Amaracandra wrote many
works, and became famous as a poet, and was honoured by the king of
Mahārāstra and other rulers. Hearing of his fame, he was invited by
Vīsaladeva to come to his court through the minister Vaijala. While entering
the court, Amaracandra praised Visaladeya with two poetic verses. There
the faculty of Amaracandra in extempore poetry was tested, and he was
given Samasyäs by Somes'vara, Somāditya of Vāmanasthalī, Kamalāditya of
Kệsyanagara, Nānāka and other court-poets, which were readily answered
by him in poetic verses. The Prabandha says that in this way he answered
108 Samasyās, and the assembly was so enchanted that the people sat there
till evening and Visaladeva accepted Amaracandra as the chief of the poets.
Though Amaracandra attained great literary fame, he always held in high
esteem Arisimha, his teacher in fine arts; this is clear from the way in which

he speaks about Arisimha in the verses appended to each canto of the
Sukệtasamkīrtana. For example-
"Arisimha, a lion for his elephant-like opponents in the field of diale-
ctics, composed this work, which like the glances of the ever-gracious Vastu-
pāla, dispenses rivers of nectar” (I. 45).
"This work, a flood of beams from the moon of the face of Lāvanya.
simha's son, which draws off the swarms of bees from those water-lilies, the
faces of the unworthy, produces mighty waves in the milk-ocean of fame of
the excellent minister Vastupāla” (VIII. 48).
Literary works of Amaracandra
104. Amaracandra was a prolific and versatile writer. His Bālabhārata
Mahākāvya, which is a summary in verse of the Mahābhārata, and Kāvyakal-
palatā, a work on rhetoric, are well-known. It is noteworthy that according
to the statement of Amaracandra himself, the Kārikās in the Kāvyakal-
palatā are partly composed by Amaracandra and partly by Arisimha.
Amaracandra also composed a commentary called the Kavis'ikṣā on the
Kāvyakalpalatā. He wrote two other commentaries on the same work, viz.
the Kavyakalpalatā-Parimala and the Kávyakalpalatā-Mañjarī, out of which
the Manjarī is not extant. Both the commentaries are referred by the
author in the Kávyakalpalatā.3 Amaracandra wrote a work on poetics,
called Alamkāraprabodha, which is also mentioned in the said Vștti (p. 116),
but it is not discovered as yet. Moreover, Amaracandra wrote the Chando-
ratnávali, a work on metrics, and the Syādis'abdasamuccaya, a work on
grammar, which has been commented upon by one Jayānanda, of uncertain
date. The Prabandhakos'a has mentioned two other works of Amaracandra,
which are lost--viz. Sūktāvali and Kalakalāpa. The former appears to
have been an anthology of verses, while the latter has been called a Šāstra by
the Prabandhakos'a, and it is probable that it may be a treatise on various
traditional arts, just like the Kalāvilāsa of Kşemendra.
Amaracandra's relations with the minister Padma
105. Among the works of Amaracandra, the Padmānanda Mahākávya
or Jinendracarita deserves special mention, because it was written under the
auspices of a patron other than Vastupāla. That patron was none else but
the minister Padma, whose name has been associated with the said work, and
in whose house Amaracandra stayed, while chanting the Sidhhasārasvata
charm, as stated in the Prabandha ( para 102 ), Amaracandra has given a
good deal of information about Padma in the Pras'asti of the Padmananda,
from which we can gather many things about an aristocratic family of Anahila-

CHAPTER V - LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHÄMÄTYA VASTUPALA
vād, which was very fond of learning and literature. Padma was born in a
Vāyađã Vanik family, and Amaracandra begins his genealogy from a man
named Vasupujya, who was a minister. Padma had received his Srikarana-
mudrã or ministerial seal from Visaladeva. His younger brother Malladeva
has been also mentioned as minister; he may be among the councillors of
Vísaladeva, and may have attained the prime-ministership during the time of
his successor Arjunadeva, because according to the inscriptions, Arjunadeva's
Mahāmātya was one Māladeva. Padma was not only an adept in politics
but was also a poet, who praised the Tirthamkara by composing new hymns.
A dialectical contest was held before him between Amaracandra and a pandita
named Gauraguya, and he gave Jayapatra or certificate of victory and the
title of Brahmendu to Amaracandra in recognition of his victory, Amara-
candra wrote his poem, Padmānanda Mahākāvya, at the request of this gentle-
man. Belonging originally to the same place, that is Vāyaļa, and being the
followers of the same gachha, these two persons-one a layman, and the other
a monk-were on very intimate terms, and it is no wonder if Amaracandra
had got from Padma much help and encouragement in his literary Pursuits,
as he had got from Vastupāla. The Padmānanda Mahākāvya, has for its
subject the life of the first Tīrthamkara Adinātha, and hence it is also known
as the Jinendracarita. Amaracandra has written another shorter work deli
neating the life of all the 24 Tirthamkaras, which is entitled as the Catur-
vims'ati-Jinendra-samkşipta-caritāni,
Chronology of Amaracandra's works
106. Nothing definite can be said regarding the chronology of Amaracan-
dra's works, because none of them bears the date of its composition. There
is not much of internal evidence to throw light on the point. We can only
say that the Kávyakalpalatā-mañjarī, Kavyakalpalatā-parimala, Alamkāra-
pahadha and Chandonatnávali were composed that the very
prabodha and Chandoratnávali were composed before the Kávyakalpalatā-
vitti, because all of them are mentioned in the latter work. Moreover,
it may be inferred from the nomenclature of the commentaries that the Man.
jari (“sprout') was the first one to be written, and was followed by the Pari-
mala ( 'fragrance'). The Padmānanda Mahākāvya was composed between
1238 (date of Vīsaladeva's accession ) and 1241 A. D. (=1297 V. S., date of
the Cambay ms.), as it cannot be earlier than the date of Vīsaladeva's
accession, because Visaladeya has been mentioned in its Prasasti as the king;
and in the same way, it cannot be later than 1241 A. D., the date of its copy.
From a reference in the Caturviñíati-Jinendra-Samkşipta-caritāni by Amar-
acandra, it can be seen that the composition of the shorter work preceded
that of the Padmānanda Mahākāvya.

107. Some verses ascribed to Amaracandra are preserved in the Prabandhas.
On the occasion of one of Vastupāla's Saṁghayātrās, Amaracandra was
dozing, and hence the former just taunted him, but Amaracandra explained the
reason of his sleepiness by way of a poetic verse, in which he described Visuu
and Laksmi conversing about the splendour of the pilgrim-caravan. And
Vastupāla put the lion-seat of Amaracandra first among all the poets. Another
verse has been noted in the Upadeśataramgiņi. Once Vastupāla was going to
attend the sermon of Amaracandra, but while at the door of the hall he heard
the Acārya uttering the following line-
HAR HATT FIRE HTCFTATTI
. And Vastupala, thinking that the Acārya's mind was full with thoughts
about women, did not salute him. Then the Acārya recited the second foot of
the verse
यत्कुक्षिप्रभवा एते वस्तुपाल भवादृशाः॥
. And being astonished, Vastupāla saluted him with honour.?

Image of Amaracandra installed in a temple
109. There is an image of Amaracandra installed in a Jaina temple at
Ayahilavād in V. S. 1349 ( =1293 A, D.) by a person named Madanacandra,
who was a disciple of Pandita Mahendra. It speaks of the eminent position :
that Amaracandra held in the field of scholarship and literature and also in the
field of gaina religion, that though he was not the head even of his own Gachha,
his image was installed and worshipped in a. Jaina temple not long after
his death.

his pupil Jayasimhasūri were the heads of the Muni Suvrata Caitya in the

Vijayasenasūri: Vastupāla's family-preceptor
110. Vijayasenasūri was the Ācārya of the Nāgendra gachha, and
Vastupāla's preceptor on the paternal side, and as such, the installation-
ceremony of the images in the temples built by Vastupāla was performed at
his hands. It was the advice and instruction of Vijayasena which inspired
the building of temples, establishment of the Bhāndāras, and the undertaking
of Samghayātrās by Vastupāla and Tejapāla. 3
Genealogy of the Nāgendra Gachha
111. Udayaprabhasūri, the chief disciple of Vijayasena, has given the
genealogy of the teachers of the Nagendra gachha in the Prasasti of his
Dharmābhyudaya Mahākāvya, and also at the end of his commentary on
the Upadesamālā: Udayaprabha begins the genealogy from an Acārya named
Mahendrasūri, who was a great scholar of the Agamas and also highly
proficient in logic. His pupil was Sãptisūri, who had vanquished the
Digambaras with the power of his knowledge. His two disciples were
Anandasűri and Amaracandrasūri, like the two tusks of the elephant in the
form of religion. They were like the Mandara mountain for the unfathomable
ocean of literature, and vanquished the rival dialecticians even in childhood,
and hence they were called “the young ones of the tiger and the lion"
(Vyāghra-simha-śiśukau) by the king Sidhharāja. Then came Haribhadrasūri,
who was known as the Kalikālagautama on account of his merits. His
pupil was Vijayasenasūri, 'whose speech is like the rainy waters able to
extinguish the fire of worldly existence.' We also know from the Prasas-
ti that when in Anahilavād, Vijayasena always used to deliver his sermon
in the temple of the Pañcāsarā Pārsvanātha, supposed to have been built by
Vanarāja, the founder of the city,
" " Intimate relations of Vijaysena with Vastupāla's family
· 112. Vijayasena's relations with the family of Vastupāla were naturally
very cordial, he being a Kulaguru or family-preceptor. A characteristic
incident showing this intimacy has been described by Merutunga. He says,
" Anupamādevi (Tejapāla's wife ) having died, the knot of grief swelled up in
Tejapāla, and could not be removed. Then Acārya Vijayasena came there
and assuaged his sorrow, and when Tejapāla had partially recovered his
self-command, he became a little ashamed of himself and was thus addressed
by the Acārya,' we have come to see this fraud of yours.' Vastupāla asked

the reverend teacher what this meant. He said, ' when Tejapāla was a boy,
I asked for him from Dharaniga the hand of the maiden Anupamã in marriage.
and the arrangement was then concluded. Afterwards he heard of the lack of
beauty of the maiden, and in order to break off the engagement, he offered
the Kșetrapāla in the shrine of Jina Candraprabha, eatables and other things
worth eight drammas. Now he is despondent on account of the pain of
separation from her; of these two sides on which lies the truth ? When
Tejapāla was thus reminded of the original state of affairs, he made his heart
firm.")
Vijayasena-a scholar and a poet
113. It was at the instance of Vijayasena that Vastupāla had gone to
salute Jagaccandrasūri of the Vțdhha Tapā gachha? and had honoured
him and his pupils. Vijayasena was a scholar. Pradyumnasūri, the author
of the Samarāditya-saṁksepa (1268. A. D.), was taught Nyāya by him,3
and he had also revised the Vivekamañjarī-Tīkā of Bālacandra. A verse
in praise of Vastupāla has been ascribed to Vijayasena by the Upadeśata-
ranginī (p. 76. aa aru eigo), but we cannot take the ascription as authentic,
because the same is found as the seventh verse of the metrical portion
of the Girnár inscription by Narendraprabha (PJLS, no. 4-4; HIG, no. 210)
and also as the 27th verse of the second Vastupālaprašasti of the same
author. No other Sanskrit composition of Vijayasena has been found
as yet, but judging from the way in which his poetic faculty has been
referred to by the contemporary authors, it is probable that he may have
composed some Sanskrit poetic works worthy of note. We have an Apa-
bhramsa work, the Revantagiri Rāsu, from his pen. It was composed on
the occasion of one of Vastupāla's pilgrimages to Girnār.
Death of Vijayasena
114. According to the colophon of a manuscript of the Pindaniryukti
in the Jaina Bhāņạār at Chāṇī, near Baroda, Vijayasenasūri died in 1301
V.S. (1245 A. D.). The manuscript appears to have been copied down
by a Sadhu of the Nagendra Gachha, as the colophon gives a metrical
genealogy of the teachers of the same Gachha, beginning from Mahendrasūri,
and hence the date given in it may be considered reliable.

Someśvara?
Udayaprabha--junior in age to Vastupāla
115. Udayaprabhasūri was the chief pupil of Vijayasenasūri. It appears
that he was considerably junior in age to Vastupāla, as Vastupāla had invited
well-known scholars from long distance for teaching Udayaprabha various
Śástras. Vastupāla also organised the function to install Udayaprabha as an
Ācārya at a large expense. 3
Literary works of Udayaprabha; he is different from Udayaprabha,
author of the Tippaņas on three Karmagranthas, etc.
116. The main literary work of Udayaprabhasūri is his Dharmābhyudaya
Mahākāvya or Samghapaticaritra, which was probably composed on the
occasion of Vastupāla's great pilgrimage in 1221 A. D., though the author has
not mentioned the date of composition or has not expressly referred to any
particular yātrā. In any case, it must have been composed before 1234 A. D.
(=1290 V. S.), because a manuscript of the work bearing that date, in Vastu-
pāla's own handwriting, has been preserved in the paina Bhāụdār at Cambay.
The Nemināthacarita of Udayaprabha (JRK, p. 217; JSI, P. 386) is not a
separate work, but it is only a part of his Dharmābhyudaya (cantos 10-14).
This statement is corroborated by the fact that the Granthāgra of the Nemi-
nāthacarita has been given as 2100 ślokas (JRK, P. 217 ), and that of the
above-mentioned five cantos in the Dharmābhyudaya is 2142 ślokas, which
can be considered almost equal, if we make allowance for the difference of a
few verses here and there, owing to discrepancies at the hands of the copy-
ists. Among other works of Udayaprabha there are two panegyrics called
the Sukrtakīrtikallolini and Vastupālastuti, glorifying the good deeds of Vast-
upāla and Tejapāla. The former work was composed on the occasion of
Vastupāla's Samghayātrā in 1221 A. D., and was inscribed on a slab in the
Indramandapa built by him on Satruñjaya.* Udayaprabha also wrote in
1243 A. D. (I299 V. S.) an exhaustive commentary called the Karnikā on
the Upadeśamālā, the famous Prākrit Prakarana by Dharmadása Gaņi (before
the gth century), while staying in the Upāśrayā built by Vastupāla at Dhava-
lakka. The commentary was composed, as mentioned in the Praśasti,
at the suggestion of Vijayasenasūri, the author's Guru, and the first copy
of the same was made by a scholar named Devabodha. It was revised
by Pradyumnasūri, pupil of Kanakaprabha and the author of the Samarāditya-

Udaypala in Stamin A 10.1 Girnār in on the phir matter
sam ksepa The scholarship of Udayaprabha is noticed in other fields
too. He composed the Arambhasidhhi, a well-known work on astrology.
A fragmentary work, only 47 verses of which have been preserved on
a palm-leaf manuscript in the Khetaravasi Bhāņdār at Pāšan, is a composition
of Udayaprabha, and the name of the work is probably Sabdabrahmollāsa,
as can be inferred from the second verse (THTETTH: TOTENSIF: FATTATE).
The extant verses are mostly for the Mamgala purposes, and it is difficult
to say anything definitely about the subject-matter of the work,
Perhaps it may have been a treatise on the philosophy of grammar, as
the title suggests. Verses in a Girnār inscription of Vastupāla are composed
by Udayaprabha. A 19-verse Prasasti of a Pauşadhaśālā built by
Vastupala in Stambhatīrtha in 1225 A. D. (1281 V. S.) was written by
Udayaprabha, and the Prabandhas ascribe to him a few Sanskrit verses,3
It may be noted here that Mallişena, the author of the Syıdvādamañjarī
(1292 A. D.), the famous work on Jaina philosophy, which is a commentary
on the Anyayogavyavachhedadvātrimśikā of Hemacandra, was a pupil
of Udayaprabhasūri (JRK, p. 12; Peterson, Report IV, p. 125). Udaya-
prabha, who wrote a commentary on the Pravacanasārodhhāra of Nemi-
candra,+ and also Tippaņas on three Karmagranthas, viz. the Karmavipāka,
Karmastava and Sataka, was a pupil of Raviprabhasūri, and hence
different from our Udayaprabha. This other Udayaprabha is older than our
Udayaprabha, and lived in the 12th century A. D. 6
(x) Jinabhadra
: 117. Jinabhadra was a pupil of Udayaprabhasūri. No more information
is available about him, but this much we know that he had composed à
Prabandhāvali or a collection of historical and legendary anecdotes, which
contained a number of stories, for the reading of Jayatasimha, Vastupāla's
son, in 1234 A. D. (=1290 V, S.). Though the work has come down
in a form which cannot be called complete and also contains some inter-
polations (para 234), it is an important source-book for the history of
Gujarāt, and as such, has been included by Jinavijayaji in that collection
of the Prabandhas, called the Purātanaprabandha-samgraha.

· Naracandra- Vastupāla's Guru on the maternal side
118. Naracandrasūri was a pupil of Devaprabhasūrix of the Harsapuriya
or Maladhāra gachha. He was the preceptor of Vastupāla on the maternal
side,4 and was in close contact with Vijayasena sūri and his pupils.
Vastupāla held him in high honour, and he had taught Vastupāla the
three Vidyās, i. e. Nyāya, Vyākarana and Sahitya, and also the Jaina
works-Sadāyaśyaka and Karmaprakřti. On the occasion of one of
his Samghayātrās, Vastupāla requested Naracandra to perform the
Vāsaksepa ceremony, but Naracandra with a high sense of propriety,
declined to do so, and at his suggestion Vastupāla called Vijayasena
and Udayaprabha, his preceptors on the paternal side, from a place called
Pilupadra or Piluái (probably modern Pilu, a few miles from Hanumāngadh
in the Bikāner State) in Mārvād. He accompanied Vastupāla in a
number of his pilgrimages.
Literary works of Naracandra
119. Naracandrasūri was a great scholar, and highly proficient at
least in four Šāstras–viz. Nyāya, Vyākarana, Sāhitya and Jyotis. In
Nyāya he has written a scholarly Tippana or gloss on the Nyāyaka-
ndalſ of Srīdhara, in Vyākaraṇa the Prākrtaprabodha, a treatise on the
Prākrit grammar, in Sāhitya a Tippana on the Anargharāghava of
Murãri," and in Jyotis the Jyotiḥsāra or Nāracandra Jyotihsāra-more
briefly known as the Náracandra, perhaps the most popular work
1 DHA, I. 13.
2 KK, I. 22.
3 Devaprabhasūri was the author of the Pāņdavacarita, a Jaina poetical
version of the Mahābhārata, a commentary on the Anargharāghava Nāt-
aka of Murāri, and seveal other works. The Prabandhas state that he gave
religious sermons citing the authority of the Brāhmin Šāstras, and hearing
him, king Viradhavala had abandoned hunting, and also partaking of meat
and liquor ( TC, V. 348 ff; PK, p. 113 ). Jagaccandrasūri was guided by
Devaprabha in the interpretation of the Jaina Āgamas (VC, VII. 320.).

of Jaina astrology. Unfortunately, only two chapters of the Jyotihsāra
are extant and as one Sāgaracandra, of uncertain date, has comment.
ed only upon these two chapters, it can be said that the complete
text was not available even to him. It was in order to satisfy the
eagerness of Vastupāla to hear the narratives pertaining to Jaina relia
gion that Naracandra sūri composed his Kathāratnākara or Kathāratna.

notice of a manuscript of the Carturvimsati-Jina-Stotra of Naracan.
dra in the Pãtan Bhāņdār, but I could not trace the manuscript in
any of the Bhāņdāras in the said place. A hymn called the Sarva-
Jina-Sádhāraụa-Stavana of Naracandra has been included in the
Jain Stotra. Sandoha (pp. 20-22), and presumably this may be identical
with the hymn noted by Peterson. Naracandra also wrote metrical
portion of two of the Girnār inscriptions of Vastupāla+ and also a
panegyric called the Vastupālaprasasti. We also know that Naracandra
had revised the Pandavacarita of his own Guru Devaprabhasūri, and
the Dharmābhyudaya of Udayaprabhasūri, as is mentioned at the
end of both these works. Moreover, he had given lessons in the
Uttarādhyayanasūtra to Pradyumnasūri, whom I have already referred
to (para. II3 and II6). Several verses ascribed to Naracandra have
1 cf. Rājaſekharasūri on Naracandra in his Nyāyakandali Pañjikā (circa
1349 A. D.)-

-Peterson, Report III, p. 275.
It may be noted here that Naracandra, who wrote Prasnasataka (1178 A.D.),
Jyotis-caturvimśikā and Janmasamudra, was a Sādhu of the Kāsahrada
gachha and a pupil of Simhasūri, and hence different from our Naracandra,

been preserved in the Prabandhas. The account of the consolation
that he gave to Vastupāla when the latter kept on seeing the image
of his mother on Satrunjaya is most touching, and also significant from
the historical point of view, because it refers to a similar incident in
the case of Sidhharāja Jayasimha.?
Date of Naracandra's death
120. According to the Prabandhakośa, Maracandrasűri died on the
tenth day of the dark fortnight of the month Bhadrapada in V.S. 1287
(=1231 A. D.).3 The Prabandha notes that some time before his
death, he prophesied the year of Vastupāla's demise.
(xii)Narendraprabhasūri
तस्य गुरोः प्रियशिष्यः प्रभुनरेन्द्रप्रभा प्रभावाब्यः । योऽलंकारमहोदधिमकरोत् काकुत्स्थकैलिं च ।।
-Rājasekharasūris
Composition of the Alamkāramahodadhi at Vastupāla's request
121. "Once Vastupāla, folding his hands with devotion, thus reques-
ted Naracandrasūri- 'Some works on Alamkāra are difficult to grasp,
because they are lengthy, while some are not sufficiently clear, as they
are too short. Some other books contain much that is irrelevant and
can be understood with difficulty. My mind is tired of listening to
such works, which give no judgment regarding the real nature of
poetic art. So please expound to me a Šāstra, which is not too long,
which contains the essence of poetic art and can be understood even
by the less intelligent,' Hearing this, the Acārya suggested to his pupil
Narendraprabhasūri to write such a work, and the latter composed the
Alamkāramahodadhi--kärikās and the vitti thereon--for the delectation of
Vastupāla. It was written, according to the author's own statement,
in V. S. 1282 (= 1226 A.D.).
Other works of Narendraprabha
122. It appears that in addition to the Alamkāramahodadhi, Naren-
draprabha had composed a work called the Kākutsthakeli, as can be
inferred from the verse of Rājasekharasūri, quoted above from
the Nyāyakandali-pañjikā. From the list of an old Bhāņdāra? we come
to know that the Kākutsthakeli was a drama, the Granthamāna or

Granthāgra? of which was 1500 Slokas. The list does not throw any
light on the subject-matter of the play, but it may be assumed from
the title that its theme may have something to do with the history of
Rāma, a favourite subject with the Sanskrit play-wrights. No manuscript
of the said work has been found as yet. Narendraprabhasūri has written
two panegyrics of Vastupāla, known as the Vastupālaprasasti-one of 104,
and the other of 37 verses. Probably, the longer Prasasti was composed
on Satruñjaya on the occasion of one of the Samghayātrās of Vastu-
pāla, as is evident from the manner in which the author refers to
that mountain( pelated Taqiat FITATEUESHUS49:9 V. 78; 79 TEHTROHISTO
1.82). There is also additional evidence in the fact that verses 77 to
98 are devoted to the enumeration of public and pious works of Vastupāla
during the pilgrimage. In the same way, one may be justified in assuming
that the shorter Vastupālaprašasti may have been composed at the com-
mencement of the aforesaid Samghayātrā, as in the last verse it refers to the
commencement of the pilgrimage, but does not give any more details, the rest
of the poem being devoted to the conventional praise of the ministers. Thus
we may believe that Narendraprabha accompanied the pilgrim-caravan; and
wrote his two panegyrics-the shorter one at the commencement of the pilgri-
mage and the longer one at the time of its completion on Satruñjaya. More
over, verses in a Girnār inscription of Vastupāla are composed by Narendra-
prabha. He also wrote two collections of verses on religious topics-Viveka-
pādapa and Vivekakalikā-from which we know that he bore the pen-name

of Asaļa (PBC, pp. 329-33; VMT, pp. 215 ff.): In the Candra
Gachha there flourished an Acārya named Pradyumnasūri, who gave religious
instruction to the king of Talavātaka (modern Talarādā, situated 8 miles west
of Bānsyādā iu Rājasthān). Candraprabhasūri, who succeeded him, composed
a morning hymn to Jina. After him came Dhanesvarasūri, who got a
Mantra from his Guru, and initiated to right understanding the goddess of
Samnayupura (modern Samau, near Pátan). He had four pupils_Virabhadra
Devasūri, Deyabhadra and Devendrasūri, like four hands of Sarasvati
Devendrasūri was staying at Mandali and he performed the installation
ceremony of the image in a temple of Mahavīra in that city. His
successor was Bhadreśvaraşūri, and after him came Abhayaderasūri who
vanquished many disputants. The poet Asaậa drank the nectar of instruction
of Ablayaderasūri, and then composed his two works--Vivekamaſjarī
and Upadeśakandali. His pupil was Haribhadra, well-versed in six schools
of philosophy and literature, and the Guru of our author,
Balacandra's Personal history and his contact with Vastupāla
124. In the first canto of his Vasantavilāsa Mahākāvya, Bālacandra
has given some account of his life, prior to his becoming a Jaina ascetic:
In the town of Moheraka (modern Modherā near Pāțan ) there was a
famous Brāhmin named Dharādeva. He was well-acquainted with Jainism.
He was a wealthy man, and supplicants coming to his house always returned
with their hands full with money. The name of his wife was Vidyut. They
had a son named Muñjāla, who though living with his parents, looked on
the world as an illusion. Being instructed and enlightened by Haribhadrasūri,
he became a Jaina asetic with the permission of his parents, and was
named Bālacandra. When Haribhadra found that his end was near, he
installed Bālacandra in his place. Bālacandra was tutored by Padmāditya,
who was a great scholar and adored by the Caulukya kings. Udayasūri of
the gachha of Vādi Deva sūri gaye him the Särasvata charm. Once, when
Bālacandra was in Yoganidrā or contemplative trance, the Goddess
Sarasvati appeared to him, and told him that she was pleased with his
devotion, and that he was just her child like Kālidāsa and other poets. And
the poet says that being thus blessed by the goddess of learning he became
bold enough to sing the fame of Vastupāla. The Prabandhas mention that
once young Balacandra praised Vastupāla with a verse (Visi raat ako),
comparing him with God Siva in every respect;a and Vastupāla, being
pleased with it, spent several thousand drammas in the ceremony for installing
Bālacandra as an Acārya.
Literary works of Balacandra
125. The main work of Bālacandra is his Vasantavilāsa Mahākāvya,
depicting the life of Vasantapāla, a name given to Vastupāla by his poet-friends
1 It may be mentioned here that this Abbayadevasūri is different from
Abhayadevasūri, the famous commentator of the Jaina Agama (para 20).
2 PC, p. 103; VC,VII. 118-20; UT, p. 73. The same verse with some alteration
has been given by Bālacandra in praise of Jaitrasimha, Vastapāla's son,
at the end of the third canto of the Vasanta vilāse. !

wo Asamome COLITIC. The conna gæc
(para 63). It was written at the request of the latter's son Jaitrasimha.
The author has not given the date of composition, but as it mentions the
death of Vastupāla in 1240 A. D. (1296 V, S.), it must have been written
after that year. Karunāvajrāyudha is a one-act play of Bālacandra, which
was acted on Satruñjaya in the temple of Adinātha, for the entertainment
of the pilgrims on the occasion of one of Vastupāla's Sanghayātrās, as
mentioned in the prologue. Some scholars think that this was the famous
Samghayātrā of 1221 A. D. Two other works of Bālacandra are his
commentaries on the Vivekamañjarī and the Upadeśakandali, two Prakaranas
in Prakrit giving Jaina religious instruction, by Āsada of the Śrīmālī community,
who was given the title of Kavi-sabhā-śțăgāra by the courtiers of the Caulukya
king, as stated in the Praśastis of both the commentaries. The commentary
on the former work was revised by Vijaya senasūri of the Nāgendra gachha
and Padmasūri of the Bșhad gachha. It bears no date, but it must have
been composed before 1245 A. D., the year of Vijayasena's death (para 114).
The commentary on the latter work is also without date, but as a palm-leaf
manuscript of the same in the Pātan Bhāņdāra is copied down in 1296 V.S.
(1240 A. D.), it must have been composed before that year. Both the
commentaries were written at the request of Jaitrasimha, the younger son
of A sada, the author of the original works. We also know from the Prasastis
of both the commentaries that as the family of Jaitrasimha followed the
Candra gachha, Bālacandra was his Kulaguru, "family-preceptor', and that he
was a spiritual son (Dharmaja) of a nun named Ratnaśrī. Pradyumnasūri
of the same gachha, who considered Bālacandra his elder brother, helped
him in writing both the commentaries. It seems that Bālacandra had also
written a work called the Gañadharāvali, giving the genealoy of Jaina teachers,
as is suggested by the title; he refers to it as his own composition in his
commentary on the Vivekamañjarī, The work is not discovered as yet. .
(xiv) Jayasimhasūri
Hammiramadamardana and Vastupāla-Tejapāla Pras'asti
126. Jayasimhasűri was a pupil of Vīrasūti and head of the Muni Suvrata
Caitya of Brgukachha. He is the author of the play Hammīramadamardana,
dramatizing Vastupāla's strategy in repulsing a Muslim attack on Gujarāt. The
play was acted at Stambhatīrtha at the instance of Jayantasimha or Jaitrasimha,
Vastupāla's son, the then governor of that city. It must have been composed
between 1223 A.D. (=1279 V.s.), the date of the beginning of Jayantasitha's
governorship and the date of the Jesalmer palm-leaf- manuscript, which was
copied down in 1230 A.D.(=1286 V.S.). Another composition of Jayasimha

sūri is a panegyric in 77 verses called the Vastupāla-Tejapāla Praśastic The
occasion of its composition was as follows-Once Tejapāla had been on a
pilgrimage to the Muni Suvrata Caitya, when the author requested him to
provide 25 Devakulikās or small shrines in the temple Sakunikāvihāra, built by
minister Ambada, with golden flag-staffs. Tejapāla agreed to it with the
consent of Vastupāla, and erected the staffs;. and Jayasimhasūri composed
the Prasasti to commemorate the occasion. It appears from the form of the
Prasasti that it must have been inscribed on a slab in the walls of the temple.
But the Sakunikāvihāra was turned into a mosque and the slab destroyed, but
the Prasasti has come down to us in the manuscript-form. It is difficult to
assign an exact date to the Prasasti.
This Jayasimhasūri different from the author of the Kumārapālacarita
and Dharmopades'amālá
127. It may be noted here that This Jayasimhasūri is different from
Jayasimhasűri of the Krøya Gachha, author of the Kumārapālacarita Mahākā-
vya (1366 A.D.), and of the Nyāyatātparya Dīpikā, a commentary on the
Nyāyasāra of Bhāsarvajña, and also different from an older Jayasimhasűri,
pupil of Kệsya, who wrote Dharmopadeśamālā in 859 A, D. (para 304 ).
(xv) Mānikyacandra
128. Māạikyacandra was a Jaina ascetic of the Rāja Gachha, and a pupil
of Sāgaracandrasūri, who was a pupil of Nemicandrasūri. He is the author
of the famous Samketa, one of the oldest and most authoritative commenta.
ries on the Kavyaprakāśa of Mammata (circa 1100 A. D.), another very old
commentary from Gujarāt being the Dīpikā or Jayanti by Jayanta (1294 A. D.),
son of Bhāradvāja and family-priest of the chief minister of king Sāramgadeva
of the Vāghelã dynasty. Māņikyacandra also composed two Mahākāvyas
-Santināthacaritra and. Pārsvanāthacaritra.*
Date of the composition of the Sanketa
. 129. The Samketa is generally believed by scholars to have been compo-
sed in 1160 A. D. (1216 V. S.). Mānikyacandra him self has mentioned
the date of composition as follows, at the end of his work-

Ordinarily, the word 27 may be taken to mean 'one' and hence the
scholars have interpreted 77-777- Terasy as "year 1216” V. S. But against
this, there are certain historical facts, which lead us to interpret 797 not as
"one" but as "six" (mouths of Kārtikeya) or "four” ( mouths of Brahman).
and consequently, the year must be read as 1266 or 1246 V, S. (i) Firstly,
Māņikyacandra composed his Pārsvanāthacaritra in A, D, 1220 (V. S. 1276)
at Devakūpaka or Dvīpa (modern Diva, an island on the southern coast of
Saurāstra). He has mentioned the date as follows:-

Now, if the author wrote the Samketa, a fruit of his mature learning
and ripe intelligence, in 1160 A. D., it is difficult to believe that he should have
been fit enough to compose a Mabākāvya sixty years afterwards in 1220 A.
D.-if at all he could have lived so long. And therefore, it would be more
natural to interpret 977 as "six" (mouths of Kārtikeya) or "four” (mouths of
Brahman), and believe the Samketa to have been composed in 1266 V.S,
(1210 A, D. ) or 1246 V, S. (1190 A. D.). This interpretation is supported
by some old authorities, the references from which were supplied to me by
Mr. Agarachand Náhatā, who has made a deep study of Sabdāmkas (sym-
bols for figures) occuring in the colophons of numerous works in Sanskrit and
Prakrit literature, and who believes that the word गुहवक्त्र, गुहवदन or कुमारमुख which
meant "six (mouths of Kārtikeya)" was shortened later on to 999,967 or ge, and
still retained its original sense. It is interesting that nowhere in the treatises
on Sabdāṁka the word ge has been used in the sense of "one" (e. g. KKL, P.
144); either it is aya or gate. (ii) secondly, in the Prasasti of the Pārsva-
nāthacaritra we are told that the author had composed that work at the req-
uest of one Dehada and his son pālhaņa (who was also a poet) of the Srimāli
community, the former being a son of Vardhamāna, who was a courtier of kings
Kumārapāla and Ajayapāla of Aṇahilavād Patan. Kumārapāla died in 1174
A. D., and was succeeded by his nephew Ajayapāla, who was murdered
by an attendent in 1177 A, D.8 . Now, if Māņikyacandra had written at the
request of the son and the grandson of a courtier of Ajayapāla (the grandson,

too, must have been of mature age, as he has been referred to by the author
as yet anlayaa), it is evident that the date of his works should be consi-
derably later than the reign of Ajayapāla. Apparently, that date must be near-
er to 1220 A. D., the date of composition of the Pārs'vanāthacaritra,
Māņikyacandra's contact with Vastupāla
130. (iii) Thirdly, there is most trustworthy evidence to show that Vāni-
kyacandra had come in close touch with Vastupāla. According to the cont-
emporary Prabandhāvali ( 1234 4. D.) of Jinabhadra? (para 117), Vastupāla
once invited Mānikyacandra at his place, when the latter was staying at Vata-
kūpa near Stambhatīrtha. Mánikyacandra did not accept the invitation on
account of some engagement. Vastupāla, rather irritated at the pride of
the scholar, sent to him a satirical verse, in which making a pun on the place-
name Vațakūpa he called him a frog of the well. Māạikyacandra retorted in
an equally pungent manner. Then Vastupāla, through his men, got manuscripts
and all other things removed from Manikyacandra's Lpāśraya at Stambha-
tīrtha, and then the Acārya came to him for making a complaint. Mániky-
acandra asked, "why should there be this trouble in my place, though you,
the chief of the community, are living?” The minister smilingly replied,
"because the reverend sir was not coming.” And then the minister returned to
Māņikyacandra all his belongings and arranged a public welcome in his
honour.3 According to the same Prabandhāvali, Mānikyacandra was
also in touch with Yasovira, a friend and contemporary of Vastupāla
(para 92). Now, if we take the date of the Samketa to be 1160 A. D., there
would arise a gross anachronism, as probably Vastupāla was not even born in
that year. The chronology becomes quite clear if we take the date 1210 or
1190 A. D., as suggested above.
131. It seems from the Prabandhas that though in the beginning the
relations of Vastupāla and Māņikyacandra were not sufficiently cordial, later
on they came nearer, and Vastupāla gave considerable literary help to Mānik-
yacandra by supplying to him manuscripts, etc. Prabandhas also quote
several verses of Mānikyacandra composed in Vastupāla's praise.
MINOR POETS AND SCHOLARS
Madana and his rivalry with Harihara
132. In addition to the poets and scholars mentioned above, there were
a number of others comparatively of minor importance, who came in touch
1 PPS, pp. 63 f.; also pp. 76 f.
2 According to the VC (VII. 99-113), Vastupāla invited Māộikyacandra to
join him in a pilgrimage, but the latter could not come, as he was engaged
upon writing of his Sanketa . He did not even care to depute any of his pupils.
3 According to the VC (VII. 113), Vastupila gave Māņikyacandra one copy
of all the important works on different Šāstras from his library.

with Vastupāla and were patronized by him. The traditional accounts of
such literary persons have been preserved in the Praband has, and we have a peep
in the contemporary literary life when we make a search for their biographical
details. Among such poets there was one Madana, who has been identified
by Dr. Bhandarkar with a Digambara Madanakīrti, whose life has been
described in the 14th chapter of the Prabandhakośa, though we may say
that there is scarcely any historical ground to do so, and that the identification
of Madana with any well-known personality of that name is, really speaking,
without any positive evidence. The Purātanaprabandhasamgraha notes that
two įreat poets named Madana and Harihara (para 80-84) in Vastupāla's
assembly were always at logger-head and they never ceased to annoy one
another. Vastupāla had ordered the door-keeper that “when one is with me,
the other should not be allowed to enter.” But once when Harihara was
having some literary discussions with Vastupāla, Madana went there, and
said-
हरिहर परिहर गर्व कविराजगजाङ्कुशो मदनः।
to which Harihara promptly retorted-
मदन विमुद्रय वदनं हरिहरचरितं स्मरातीतम् ।।
Then, to make an end of their controversy, Vastupāla said, "he will
be considered a Mahākavi who composes one hundred verses at once”.
Madana at once composed a hundred verses describing a cocoanut, while
Harihara could prepare only sixty. Harihara was told by Vastupāla that
he was vanquished. Thereupon Harihara uttered a verse showing the
difference between a large quantity of coarse garments prepared by a village-
weaver and a precious cloth fit to be worn by the queens, suggesting thereby
that in poetry quality is more important than quantity. Vastupāla, entertained
by this, gave pleasure-gifts to both these poets. The account given by the
Purātanaprabandhasamgraha is supported by the Subhāṣitaratnakośa of
Krsna, as it has quoted the verses showing the poetic rivalry between
Madana and Harihara.
Pālhaņaputra, Cácariyāka and others
133. There was a poet who called himself Pālhayaputra or son of Palh-
ana, who composed in 1233 A. D. (V. S.1289) Aburāsa, a poem in Apabhr-
amśa, commemorating Vastupāla's building of temples on Abu two years
earlier. A scholar named Cácariyāka had come to Dhavalakka in the times
of Vastupāla, and his speech was so instructive that Udayaprabhasūri was
going incognito to hear him. Vastupāla presented him with two thousand
drammas and honoured him in public. Cácariyāka had a pupil named
Haradeva, who had highly entertained the people of Āsāpalli (same as KaȚ9-

āvatī on the site of modern Ahmedabad) by reciting the Rāmāyana. We
are also told about two reciters of religious stories, both known as Pippalā-
cārya, who had won a large prize in cash from Tejapāla and Anupamā by
singing before them the life of Sati Candanabālā.” In addition to these, we
get names of several other poets and bards-Yasodhara of Vāmanasthali,
Madhava, Kamalāditya of Krsnanagar, Sarkarastāmin, Dāmodara,?
Vikala, Vairisimha of Prabhāsa Pāțaw,' Jayantadeva or Jayadeva, 10 etc.,
who entertained Vastupāla with their poetic achievements and whose verses
composed on various occasions-like a pilgrimage, a victory, a poetic assembly
or a welcome-have been quoted in the Prabandhas. They were amply
rewarded by their patron.
Vastupāla's family-members credited with poetic achievements
134. It would be interesting here to note that several family-members of
Vastupāla are also credited with poetic achievements. Some verses are ascrib-
ed to Tejapāla,11 the one recited by hiin at the time of welcoming Yasovīra
on Abu being especially noteworthy.13 Tejapāla's famous wife Anupamā,
who was praised by the followers of the six systems as Saddarśanamātā or
the mother of six darśanas on account of her equal treatment of all in matters
of giving donations, has been credited with the composition of a kamkana-
kāvya ('a woman's poem ?'), which has been expressly mentioned as her own
work.13 Jayantasimha or Jaitrasimha, Vastupāla's son, who was also a
patron of literature, as we have already seen (para 117 and 126), had
uttered a verse at the death of his father, which has been quoted in more
than one Prabandhas.14 It is not to be wondered at if persons brought up in
a literary atmosphere saturated with Sanskrit learning, though not poets
themselves, could compose stray versts when moved on particular occasions.
And in that way, there is no reason to doubt the statements found in the
Prabandhas.
ANONYMOUS POETS
135. In addition to these, there were a number of poets whose names are
not known, but whose verses in praise of Vastupāla on different occasions are

quoted in the Prabandlias. The number of such laudatory verses available
ascribe l to anonymous poets would exceed perhaps one hundred, which
shows that they were patronized by Vastupāla, and it is expressly mentioned
that they were rewarded with large gifts. There were a number of Bhattas
or bards and Cãranas among these poets, and some of them have praised
their patron in Apabhramsa Dūhās?-Dūhā being the most widely current
metre for literary compositions, especially of lyric and gnomic type, in the
Apabhramsa and old western Rajasthāni literature.

CHAPTER VI
MAHAKAVYAS
136. After making a historical and biographical study of the literary circle
of Vastupāla, we now come to the contribution which it made to Sanskrit
literature. For that purpose, it is necessary to make a survey of the
literary works extant composed by the poets and scholars in that circle.
I propose to make that survey by classifying the literature according to
form, and beginning with the Mahākāvya.
Characteristics of the Mahākāvya
137. The Mahākāvya (lit. «great narrative poem'jalong with the Vataka
or drama is decidedly the most popular form of Sanskrit literature and
hundreds of poets from the days of Asvaghosa or even before have attempted
that form. Dandin (circa. 600 A. D.), in his Kāryādarśa, has described the
characteristics of Mahākāvya in the following manner: "Composition in
canto is a long poem (Malvākāvya) and its definition is being given (now).
Its opening is a benediction, a salutation, or naming of the principal theme;
it springs from a historical incident (Itihāsa-kathā) or is otherwise based
upon sume fact (Sadāśraya); it turns upon the fruition of the fourfold ends
and its hero is clever and noble; by description of cities, oceans, mountains,
seasons and risings of the moon or the sun; through sporting and love;
through sentiments of love in separation and through marriages, by descri-
ption of the birth and rise of princes, and likewise through state-counsel,
embassy, advance, battle, and the hero's triumph; embellished; not too
condensed, and pervaded all through with poetic sentiments and emotions,
with cantos none too lengthy and having agreeable metres and well-formed
joints, and in each case with an ending in a different metre, furnished; such
a poum possessing good figures of speech wins the peoples' heart and
endures longer than (even) a Kalpa”. 2
138. As mentioned in the above definition, a Mahākāvya is based on
Itihasa-kathā, that is, a story handed down traditionally; or otherwise, as
Daudin says, it may be Sadāšraya or based upon some real fact, that .
is, a historical incident in the modern sense. Most of the Mahākāvyas
in Sanskrit literature are based upon mythological themes. It is in com-
paratively later times that one finds poems based upon incidents which can
be looked upon as historical. Nevertheless the Indian literary taste was
so much enchanted with the mythological heroes, whose lives made an
appeal throughout the length and breadth of the whole of India that the
1 I am translating the word Mabākävya in this way to distinguish it from
the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mabābhārata, for which the word 'epic may be
reserved.

detailed definitions of the Mahākāvya, vide the Kāvýālajnkāra of Ruirata ,
XVI. 7-18; and the Sāhityadarpaça, VI. 315-25.

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTTA VASTUPĀLA
Mahākāryas having less widely known heroes of recent history could attain
only a limited popularity in comparision with those based on mythology.
Inspite of this general tendency, in certain parts of India like Gujarāt, a large
number of Mahākāryas based upon historical events and personalities were
written and they were fairly popular. The historical Mahākāvyas of which
we are going to make a survey, have predecessors in Gujarāt in such works
as the two Dvyāśraya Mahākāvyas of Hemacandra (para 24) and successors
in such works as the Dhārādhyamsa of Ganapati Vyāsa, referred to in
the Praśasti of Nánāka (para 88), but not discovered as yet, the Kumāra-
pālacarita Māhākāvya (1367 A. D.) of Jayasimhasūri, the Somasaubhāgya
(1468 A. D.) of Pratişthấsoma, the Hirasaubhāgya of Devavimala (17th
century), and other works; and several Caritras can be conveniently
included under this head. The contribution of the literary circle of
Vastupāla in the domain of Mahākavya consists of four historical Mahā-
kāvyas and several others which are based either on Brahmanical or Jaina
mythology. After making a historical and biographical study of Vastupāla
and his literary circle, it would be more suitable to discuss these two types
in separate sections, and to review the historical ones first.
Study of the classical models in Gujarāt
139. While reviewing these works, we have to bear in mind that we
may not expect in them the first class poetry of the clasical period, but that
does not mean that their achievements in literary skill are negligible, because
they were a result of a competent study of the classical models. In mediaeval
Gujarāt, there was a great scholastic activity going on, as I have already pointed
out earlier, and the works of the great masters like those of Kālidāsa, Bhatti,
Bhāravi, Māgha, and later on of Sriharsa, were being zealously studied
and commented upon, and these provided much mental food to the
aspiring poets. Among the lovers of drama, the plays of Harsa and the
Anargharāghava of Murāri were very popular. However, the literary works
which we are to study are not mere imitations of the great masters; rather
they are inspired by the style, descriptions and subject-matter of the older
poems, but have an individuality of their own, and in certain cases at least,
• we get poems which can be ranked among finest productions of mediaeval
Sanskrit poetry.
SECTION I
HISTORICAL MAHĀKĀVYAS
The Kīrtikaumudī of Somes'vara
140. Coming to the historical Mahākávyas, we first take the Kīrtikau-
mudī of Someśvara, which, as we have seen, is the main source of informa-
tion among the contemporary works for the history of the Vāghelās and also
1 For a number of commentaries on the Pañcakāvyas written in Gujarāt,

for the history of Vastupāla. It is a poem in nine cantos, comprising 722
verses in all. In the first canto, after saluting the four hands of Vişnu, which
are like the four sentinels of Dharma, the poet pays liis homage to God
Siva and goddess Sarasvati. Then he praises the poets in general, and
particularly has devoted separate stanzas to Valınīki, Vyāsa, Kālidāsa,
Māgha, Bhāravi, Bāna, Dhanapāla, Bihlana, Hemacandra, Nilakautha and
Prahladana. Among the poets in the literary circle of Vastupāla, he has
praised Naracandra, Vijayasena, Subhața and Yasovira. After praising the
good and having censured the wicked in a few verses the poet says that he
has proceeded to write a poem about Vastupāla having observed his high
birth, generosity, hospitality, good conduct, wisdom, mercy, justice and
devotion towards him (i, e, the poet), and that his speech becomes, as if eager
to sing the merits of Vastupāla (19. 44-47). Then the poet gives a description
of Aụanilavād, which though full of poetic embellishments, is sufficiently
realistic to give an idea of the glories of that capital city of the Gujarāt
kingdom, Among many other things, the poet has made a special mention
of the lake Sahasraliſga and Kirtistambha on its bank (vv. 71-81).
141. The second canto gives the history of the kings of Gujarat from
Mūlarāja to Lavaņaprasāda and his son Vīradhavala of Dhavalakka. It
mentions Mūlarāja, Cāmunda, Vallabharāja, Durlabharāja, Bhima, Karna,
Jaysiṁha Sidhharājā, Kumārapāla, Ajayapāla, Mūlarāja II and Bhīma II, and
describes their political career and warlike exploits in a few poetical lines
(vv. 1-61), and comes to Dhavala, the first man of the Vāghelā dynasty and
his son Arnorāja, who tried his best to put the Caulukya kingdom of Gujarāt
on a firm foundation. The treatment naturally becomes more detailed, when
the poet co.nes to ArŅorāja's son Lavaņaprasāda and grandson Vīradhavala,
who had selected Vastupāla as their minister. Lavanaprasāda slew the lord
of Nadul. In his kingdom thieves were unknown. Only he carried away
the glories of the hostile kings. His son, the illustrious Vīradhavala, resem-
bled his father so closely that he reflected, as it were, his image in the mirror
(vv. 67-77). Once Lavaụaprasāda, waking up at day-break, sent for his
purohita Someśvaradeva (the author himself) to inform him of the dream
which he had seen during the night. The priest came, gave his blessings to
the chief, and sat down on a mat. Then Lavanaprasāda, attended by his
son Vīradhavala, began to narrate as follows (vv. 83-86)-"It seemed to
me that I ascended the mountain of Siva and worshipped the god, who visi-
bly appeared before my eyes. Then as I finished my worship and became
absorbed in holy meditation, I saw standing before me a moon-faced woman
beautiful like the Rāká (the goddess of the full-moon), dressed in white
garments, annointed with white unguents, and holding a chaplet in her hands.
Wondering, I asked her who she was and why she had come. Then she
addressed me thus-m-'O hero, know that I am the royal fortune of the Gurjara
kings, who is sorely tormented by the crowds of the enemies. Alas! those
Gurjara princes are dead, who were able to destroy their foes, and in whose
arms I used to rest. The young or foolish king who rules in their stead is

unable to subdue the armies of his enemies. His Mantrins and Māndalikas
possess neither wisdom nor valour. They even cast their lustful glances to
me, though I am their lord's lawful wife. The Purohita Amaśarman is dead,
who used to protect me. Gone is the son of Muñjāla, who humbled rebellious
Rājputs. Pratāpamalla of the Rāstrakūţa clan is no longer, who could not
even bear the smell of the hostile elephants. My own people have brought
me very low, all except one, namely Jagaddeva, who kept the enemy from
entering the capital. No lights shine at night in the capital of the Gurjara
land; it resounds with the howl of the jackal, its walls are broken. There-
fore, do thou, together with thy son Vīradhavala rescue me and save'.” And
Lavaụaprasāda continued, "After the goddess had spoken thus, she threw her
garland on my neck and vanished together with my dream. Now, tell me
what this means." Hereupon Someśvara addressed the chief, declared him
to be the happiest of all Rājputs, since fortune wooed him of her own accord,
and he exhorted him to accept the charge laid upon him and to engage able
ministers (vv. 87-113)
142. This allegorical description hints at the fact that Lavanaprasāda
had taken into his hands the reign of Government at Anahilavād to remove
disorder and to protect the fortune of the king. The same allegory, with
some alterations, additions and embellishments occurs in other contempo-
rary works like the Sukệtasamkīrtana and the Vasantavilāsa, and the later
chronicles like the Prabandhakośa and the Vastupālacarita. The plain fact
may be this that Lavanaprasāda and his son employed various tactics-fair
and foul-to uproot the enemies of Bhimadeva, and hence the chroniclers were
obliged to justify all their actions in this way in the interests of the royal
fortune of Gujarāt.
143. In the third canto the poet gives an account of Vastupāla's ance.
stors right onwards from Caụdapa and completes the genealogy mentioning
Vastupāla's son Jaitrasimha and Tejapāla's son Lāvanyasimha (vv. 1-50).
Lavaṇaprasāda was thinking of appointing able ministers, and he instantly
called for Vastupāla and Tejapala, whom he held in high esteem, and expressed
his desire to appoint them as his counsellors. Vastupāla accepted the
offer and the chief gave the two brothers the charge of ministerial seal.
The fourth canto says that after his appointment Vastupāla was sent
to Stambhatīrtha, where he re-established order and overhauled the
administration (para 49), and peace began to reign in the land, when
Simhaụa of Devagiri invaded Gnjarāt, but was repulsed by Lavaṇaprasāda.
Samkha of Lăța, who considered the port of Stambhatīrtha his own property,
sent messenger to Vastupāla, and pressed the latter to accept his service,
But Vastupāla gave a crushing rejoinder, and the messenger had to return.
The fifth canto describes the fierce battle between Vastupāla and Samkha, in
which brave warriors on both the sides were killed, but in the end Samkha
of Brgukachba had to make a retreat with the remainder of his army.
The sixth canto is mainly devoted to the festivities of the citizens of

CHAPTER VI- MAHĀKĀVYAS
Stambhatirtha, elated with delight at Vastupāla's valour in fighting the
imminent calamity. The houses were white-washed, the sounds of musical
instruments were heard, the house-wives began to sing pleasant songs, special
ceremonies were held in the temples, the high roads were decorated, and
women wore costly attire (vv. 2-3). There was a festival in the temple
of the goddess Ekallavīrā, and the minister with a small retinue went to
salute the goddess, and the men and women flocked on the roads to have
a glance at the victorious hero. After worshipping the goddess, the minister
entered the pleasure-grove, and there at the noon-time he sat in a conference
with the poets. Sonie poets admired his family, some his gifts, and others
his virtuous character. The ears of Vastupāla, who was like Karna, were
purified by the speech of the poets, and he in his turn delighted their hearts
with his generosity. Thus being sprinkled by the nectar of poetry,
Vastupāla spent the noon in summer season, in the garden in the company
of the poets, and returned home in the evening (IV. 49-56).
144. The suventh canto is devoted to traditional description of moon-rise
and love-sports, full of high poetic fancy. The eighth canto is stried the
Parmārtha-vicāra or religious thought. After the morning bath, the minister
worshipped the Tirthamkara, and became deeply engrossed in religious
thoughts, and decided to make a pilgrimage. The ninth canto is devoted
to the description of the Samghayātrā. The pilgrim-caravan started on an
auspicious day with numerous elephants, horses, bullocks, camels, chariots
and all the important articles of daily use. A large number of servants
were taken with the Samgha. Those who had no conveyance were given
conveyance, those in need of money were given money, and those who
required cloths were given cloths. The Samgha was given due reception in all
the towns on the way. The men and women in the Samgha were singing
religious songs, and worshipped the images of Jina in the temples in course
of their travel. The minister reached the beautiful peak of Satruñjaya, and
worshipped with flowers the Yaksa called Kapardin. There he built two
imposing shrines of Neminātha and Pārsvanātha, and in the assembly-hall
of the latter temple he put the equestrian statues of his ancestors, brothers
and friends, and constructed a lake near the mountain (vv. 31-36). Staying
there for two or three days (v. 37), he went to the mountain Rairataka
(Girnār), and entering the shrine of Neminātha, worhipped the deity with
perfumes, so that the whole mountain became fragrant. Forgetting the
worries of political affairs he spent there many days (v. 69), and then going
to Prabhāsa Pátan in Southern Saurāstra saluted the Tīrthamkara Candra-
prabha and worshipped the God Somanátha with devotion, and then returned
to his city Dhavalakka, giving donations to the supplicants. The women of
pass tupála's stay on the TIA, Vol. XX3
1 This statement is of particular interest, because the Jaina pilgrims never
pass the night on the mountain now. The SS (VI. 43) informs us that
Vastupāla's stay on the mountain lasted for eight days, which is also
corroborated by the VC(IA, Vol. XXXI, p. 489 n.). In any case, it is
certain that in those days the pilgrims used to spend several nights on
the holy mountain.

the city flocked to see the minister, though they had seen him previously
perhaps a hundred times. Having entered the town, Vastupā.la touched the
feet of his Indra-like master, and bade farewell to the people of the Samgha
having given them a welcome (v. 77). And Someśvara completes his poem
with a final benediction that Vastupāla, a great donor like Karņa, may be
ever-victorious, hearing the admiration of his fame, sung by the bards.(v. 78).
145. Thus the Kirtikaumudi is a poem written to eulogize a contemporary
hero, but at the same time it fulfils all the conditions laid down for the
literary form of Mahākāvya. It is based upon the life of an actual person
(Sadāśraya), and its hero is intelligent and noble (Caturodātta). The style of
Someśvara in this poem is the easy and simple Vaidarbhi style, sufficiently
elevated and grand at appropriate places; he seldom employs any ślesas,
and as a rule, he is free in this poem from the artificialities prevalent in the
poetic art of his times. Clearly, the model of Someśvara is Kālidāsa, and at
least one of his Mahākāvyas, viz. the Kirtikaumudī, is such as can stand
honourably with the famous specimens of Sanskrit poetry, composed after
Kálidāsa, Bhāravi, and Māgha. In the first canto of the Surathotsava, he has
expressed his fondness for Kālidāsa's poetry in the following words, "my
intellect does not find pleasure in any other poem, when I think of the speech
of Kálidāsa. Would ever the swarm of bees delight in the Sindhuvāra flower
abandoning the heavenly Pārijāta ?" This statement by the poet himself
becomes significant, when we know that the autobiographical account of the
royal glory in the Kīrtikaumudi (II) is an unmistakable reflection, if not
imitation, of an almost similar account in the Raghuvamsa (XVI. 4-24)
of the desolate city of Ayodhyā, requesting Kuśa to shift his capital back
from Kuśāvatī to the parental town. A number of descriptions in the
Kārtikaumudi are of such high literary merit as can stand in comparison with
some of the best specimens of Sanskrit poetry. The description of Anahil-
avād, the lake Sahasralimga and the Kīrtistambha (I. 47 ff.); and lamentation
of the royal glory of Gujarāt in her misery (II. 87 ff); welcome of Vastupāla
in Stambhatīrtha, when he went to that city as a governor (11. 7-8), and
festivities of the citizens when Samkha was defeated' (VI. 2 ff); the descri-
ption of women hurrying to have a glance at Vastupāla (VI. 16 ff.), which is
reminiscent of similar descriptions in Asvaghosa, Kālidāsa and Bãụa; the ,
charming description of moon-rise (VII), and narration of the great Samgha-
yātrā (IX)-are some instances in point. The short dialogue between Vast-
upāla and Lavaṇaprasāda (III. 59 ff.) is an illustration of forceful poetic
dialogue, containing important discussion on politics, such as we find in the
beginning of the Siśupālavadha and the Kirātārjunīya. .
146. It would be proper here to quote a few verses from the Kīrtika-
umudi, which would give some idea of Someśvara's poetic art at its best; e.g.
description of the Kirtistambha in one verse-
यस्योच्चैः सरसस्तीरे राजते रजतोज्वल । कीर्तिस्तम्भो नभोगङ्गाप्रवाहोऽवतरन्निव ॥
(1.75)

And the pitiable condition of Anahilavād in the reign of Bhimadera,
as described by the Rājyalaksmī:

Someśvara's argument before Lavanapra sõda to appoint capable
ministers:

रत्नावली जलधयो जनयन्ति किन्तु संस्कारमत्र मणिकारगण : करोति ।
(II. II3)
Vastupāla expresses readiness to accept the charge of ministership
only if the king is willing to act justly in matters political :
पुरस्कृत्य न्याय खलजनमनादृत्य सहजान्नरीनिर्जित्य श्रीपतिचरितमाश्रित्य च यदि ।
समुद्धर्तु धात्रीमभिलपसि तत्लैष शिरसा धृतो देवादेश : स्फुटमपरथा स्वस्ति भवते ।।
(III. 77)
There is a powerful description of panic in the Gurjara land, wlien
Simhana attacked it:

Two out of several pithy sayings put in the mouth of Vastupāla before
he starts on a pilgrimage :
पित्राद्यैरुपभुक्ता या पुत्राद्यैरपि भोज्यते । कामयन्ते न तां सन्नो ग्रामवेश्यामिव श्रियम् ॥
(VIII. 35)

(VIII. 37)
And he comes to the conclusion that Dharma is the only support in
life:
विधौ विध्यति सक्रोधे वर्म धर्मः शरीरिणाम् । स एव केवलं तस्मादस्माकं जायतां गतिः।।
(VIII. 56)
Sukrtasamkırtana of Arisimha
147. Sukſta samkīrtana of Arisimha is another historical Mahākāvya,
which also has for its theme the life and works of Vastupāla. As its name
suggests, it has been composed for commemorating the good deeds of Vast-
upāla. Just as the Kirtikaumudi puts comparatively more emphasis on the
political side of Vastupāla's life, the Sukrtasamkīrtana gives more space to
his religious and public works. Thus the two poems supplement each other,
and it is quite possible that they were written with the same end in view.
The Sukrtasamkirtana has II cantos and 553 verses in all.
148. The first canto gives a genealogy of the kings of the Capotkața or
Cāvadā dynasty, which was the first ruling family at Anahilavād, and a descri-
ption of that city. It is worthy of note that out of a large number of historical
poems written in Gujarāt during the Caulukya and the Vāghelā period, only
the Sukrtasamkīrtana of Arisimha and Sukſtakīrtikallolini of Udayaprabha
have mentioned the Cāvadās, and even Hemacandra who made a regular
attempt to write a history of his city has remained silent on this matter. It
was probably because the Cāvadās were considered an unimportant dynasty

Page 144****************************************************************************************
CHAPTER FI - MAHAKAVYAS

ruling over a small territory, though Vanarāja of the same clan was the
founder of Anahilavād. Arisimha has mentioned eight kings of the Cãraçā
dynasty, viz. Vanarāja, Yogarāja, Ratnāditya, Vairisimlia, Ksemarāja,
Cámunda, Rāhada and Bhūbhata. He has nothing particular to say about
them except with reference to Vanarāja that he had built the temple of Panca-
sarā Pārsvanātha in Anahilavād ( I. 10), which was later on repaired by
Vastupāla (XI. 2). The second cunto is devoted to description of the
Caulukya dynasty, and beginning from Mūlarāja, the poet comes upto Bhima-
deva II, whom he describes as beset with worries, because his territories
were usurped by his feudatories (II. 51). Vo more historical information
is derived from it than what we obtain from the Kirtikaumudī.
149. The third canto is styled Mantriprakāśa or appearance of ministers.
If we compare the narrative given in this canto with that given by. Someśvara
in the second canto of the Kirtikaumudi, a considerable difference can be
marked. According to Someśvara's representation, a female figure symboli-
sing, the fortune of kings of Gujarāt appeared in a dream to Lavanaprasāda,
and called upon him to save the kingdom which had fallen into decay under
the rule of Bhīma. Thereupon, obeying the command of the goddess,
Lavanaprasāda and Vīradhavala took upon themselves the task of re-establi-
shing the glory of Anahilavād, and appointed Vastupāla and Tejapāla as
their ministers. That is the simple story, when we reject the mythological
additions, which Someśvara as.a good court-poet was bound to have
inserted. Arisimha has put the matter in a different manner. Kuinārapāla
(who, as we know, was a cousin of Arầorāja, the first man of the Vaghela
clan) appeared to Bhīna in a dream in the form of a god (III. I ff.), and
ordered him to appoint Lavanaprasãda as his Sarvesvara (III. 23), so
that the latter may destory the enemies, and make him the lord of wealth.
Bhima in his assembly appointed Lavanaprasāda as Sarvesvara, and calleci
Vīradhavala his Yuvarāj (III. 37-39). Lavanaprasāda requested Bhima that
1 The earliest inscriptional reference to the Cãradās is to be found in the
Vadaagar inscription of Kumārapāla dated V. S. 1208 (1152 A. D.). The
earliest literary reference to the name of Vanarāja, founder of Anahilavād,
and first king of the Cāvadā dynasty, who ruled there, is in the Prasasti of
an Apabbramsa work called Nemināhacariu composed by Haribhadrasūri
( different from his famous name-sake mentioned in para 17) in V. S. 1216
i. e. 1160 A. D. (R. C. Parikh, Kāvyānuśāsana, intro., p. 103). There is
considerable difference in the genealogy of the Cāvadā kings and their
years of rule given in the later works, and the chronology of the Cāvadās has
not been satisfactorily settled as yet. For a discussion of the problem, vido

to do his task properly he must have a minister who may be proficient in the
use of Sāstras (authoritative treatises) and the Sastra (use of arms), equally
an adept in the replenishing of treasury and fighting battles (III. 43 ). The
king, having thought for a while replied that he would readily lend the
services of Vastupāla and Tejapāla, and ordered them to work as ministers
of Viradhavala (III. 44 ff.).
150. Having thus described Vastupāla's promotion to political power,
Arisimha comes to his Sukrta or pious works in the fourth canto.
Vīradhavala conquered, with the help of Vastupāla, 'the ocean-girt earth.”
Then, on the advice of his brother, Vastupāla once decided to hear the
preachings of his preceptor and to do the pious works according to his advice
(IV. 14-26). At this juncture the poet gives the genealogy of the monks
of the Nāgendra gachha, who from the time of Caụdapa served his family
as spirtual preceptors from Mahendrasūri to Vijaya senasūri (IV. 15–26).
Vastupāla goes to Vijayasena and hears sermon. The Guru commends
a pilgrimage as a meritorious deed (IV. 33-43), and consequently Vastupāla
decides to lead a Samgha to Satruñjaya and Girnăr (IV. 44). The fifth
canto describes the preparations for journey (v. 1-6), which can be
compared with the description of the same topic in the Kirtikaumudi
(Canto IX). The poet says that physicians were also taken, carrying
necessary medicines, so that the sick could be given assistance (v. 2-4).
Vastupāla personally went to the monastaries and invited the monks
respectfully to join the Samgha (v. 6). Names of some distinguished
monks who tooks part in the pilgrimage are also mentioned. They are
Naracandrasūri, Jinadatta sūri of the Vāyaṇa gachha, who was abode of
arts, Säntisūri of the Sanderaka gachha,3 and Vardhamānasūri, «the sun of
the Gallakas' (v. 10-13). The canto closes with the arrival of the Samgha
at the foot of the mountain Satruñjaya.
आहूय तौ स्वयं प्राह नमन्मौली सहोदरौ। युवां नरेन्द्रव्यापारपारावारकपारगौ।।
कुरुतां मन्त्रितां वीरधवलस्य मदाकृतेः ।
(SS, III. 58-59).

3 śāntisūri was the preceptor of minister Yašovīra of Jābālipura (para 94).
Installation-ceremonies of images in the temples built by Yaśovīra were
performed by this $cārya (PJLS, nos. 108-109).
4 Vardhamānasūri was an Acārya of the Vrdhha gachba (VC, VIII. 603).
Vastupāla did a pilgrimage to Samkbeśvara in North Gnjarāt on hearing
his sermon (VC, VII. 284–97). He is also mentioned in the PPS
(pp. 68, 83, 95, 119).
5 The Gallakas seem to be a tribe or a caste of which Vardhamānasūri was
a spiritual head (cf. a quinariasteceratszę 1870 18HTTEST : ( SS, V. 13).
According to an inscription from Verāval in Saurāştra dated Valabbi era
927( 1246 A. D. ), Śreşthin Mūla, who belonged to the Gallaka community
(Gallaka-Jātiya), had installed an image of Govardhana at Prabhās Pātan
(HIG, no. 350 A). Perhips the word Gallaka may have some affinity with

151. The sixth canto is devoted to a conventional description of sunrise,
and the seventh describes the ascent of the mountain and the festivities
there in the next morning. After saluting the Yakşa Kapardin, Vastupāla
went to the main shrine of Ādinātha, where the pilgrims followed him.
Vastupāla laid himself prostrate outside the shrine, and praised the Jina
in a hymn (VII. 26–33). Then he entered the shrine after purifying himself
amidst dances and songs, and washed the image with saffron-water, rubbed
it with musk and put the flowers on it. After staying on the mountain for
eight days the minister descended from it, and became eager to go to Girnār.
The eighth canto describes how the minister made a pilgrimage to the
shrine of Somanātha at Prabhās Pāțan, and to that of Neminātha on Girnār,
where also he stayed for eight days. The Vinth canto describes the
beauties of six seasons, which Vastupāla saw on the slope of the mountain,
and thus adds to the poem a traditional feature required by the technical
rules of the Mahākāvya.
· 152. The tenth canto describes the return journey of the Samgha from
Girnār to Dhavalakka. After coming down from the mountain, Vastupāla
feasted the pilgrims and distributed gifts among them. Then he went to
Vámanasthali and made a solemn entry into the town, because formerly
the faina pilgrims were prohibited to enter the place (X. 6), probably
because of the opposition of Sāṁgaṇa and Cāmunda, the two brothers-in-law
of Viradhavala (para 52). When the pilgrim-caravan reached the vicinity of
Dhavalakka, king Viradhavala and a large number of citizens canie to receive
it. Vastupāla, with his brother Tejapāla and king Vīradhavala, "like Siva
in the form of Tripuruşa" (X. II), entered the town amidst praises of bards
(X. 14-29) and passionate expressions of joy by the women (1. 31-42).
153. The eleventh canto is devoted to the gooi deeds of Vastupāla,
and that is perhaps the principal part of the work, judging from its title,
It says in the beginning that immediately after Vastupāla was appointed
the governor of Stambhatīrtha, he began to build temples, which were like
the embodiments of his fame on the earth. The canto enumerates
(vv. 2–34) forty-three buildings, restorations and institutions of different
kinds. The actual list of Vastupāla's public works must have been still
larger, because the Sukệtasamkirtana was composed before 1231 A. D.
(para 98), and could not have mentioned works undertaken or carried out
after that date. Arisimha has given the list in a classified manner, taking
note of the public works in different towns, one by one. He mentions the
temples, tanks and other structures built and restored in Anahilavād, Stam-
the governdiments of buildings, restos public
the Canarese and Telugu word Golla, meaning 'a shepherd'. In the comm-
· entaries on the Jaina canonical works we have frequent references to the
Golladeśa, and at one place, we are informed that the famous Cāņakya was
korn in a village called Caņaka in that country (Abhidhāna-Rajendra,
vol. II, p. 1011). But we have hardly any evidence to decide the exact
location of that region. It is possible that the Gallaka community may
have been originally from that country.

Abu.? The list mentions the restoration and decoration of a number of
Brähmanical temples too, thus throwing light on the catholicity of outlook
of this great philanthrophist. In the end, the poet expresses his inability
to speak adequately of the vast number of Vastupāla's public works, and
completes the poem with a eulogy of his fame.
154. The Sukſtasarkīrtana cannot bear comparision with the Kīrtikau-
mudi from the literary point of view. However, the poet is a good versifier,
and has to his credit some good descriptions and pleasing Sabdālaňkāras,
which may be the result of his study of Alamkāra Šāstra. The description
of Anahilavād, which is more imaginary than actual (I. roff.), the appearance
of Kumārapāla in Bhimadeva's dream and his exhortation to the latter
(III. 1 ff), and rising of dust an account of going forth of the Samgha (V.
22 ff); beautiful descriptions of the moon-rise (VI) and the six seasons (IX),
full of charining alliterations--are some of Arisimha's notable achievements.
The dance of the Śrāvaka ladies in the beginning of the sixth canto is
nothing but the Garabā dance still prevalent in Gujarāt, and gives a chara-
cteristic local touch to the composition-

The Vasantavilāsa of Bālacandra
155. Now we come to the Vasantavilāsa Mahākāvya of Bālacandra,
which as pointed out earlier (para 40 and 125), describes the life of
Vastupāla. The poem is divided into 14 cantos, and contains 1021 verses
in all. At the end of cach canto the poet has given one verse in praise of
Jaitrasimha, Vastupāla's son, at whose instance he had composed his work
(vide para 125).
156. In the first canto. after praising the good and censuring the wicked,
and dwelling at length on the nectar of poetry, the poet has given his
personal history and has described how he was favoured by Sarasvati.
Introducing his hero, he justifies the choice of his subject-matter by saying

99
that "those qualities which resided in Nala, Rāma and Yudhisthira are
now-a-days seen in Vastupāla, and hence I sing of him” (1. 76). The
second canto is devoted to a description of Anahillapura, its big gold-knobbed
temples, its palace-like buildings, its magnificent fort and the ditch around
it, and the Durlabharāja tank. In the third, canto we are given a history
of the kings of Gujarat from Mūlarāja to Bhimadeva II, which can be
compared with that in the Kirtikaumudi and the Sukrta sankirtana. Valour
of Viradhavala and his ancestors in protecting the state of Gujarat from
anarchy has been praised (III. 37-50). Fortune of the Gurjara kingdom
appears in Vīradhavala's dream and entreats him to protect her from her
sorry plight under the weak rule of Bhimadera, and advises him to appoint
Vastupāla and Tejapāla as ministers to help him for attaining that end
(III. 51-64). It is evident that the whole thing is a direct adaptation of the
episode described in the Kirtikaunudi (para 141.)
157. The fourth canto describes in hyperbolic terms the high merits
of both the ministers, and ends with the appointment of Vastupāla as the
governor of Stambhatīrtha. The fifth curto narrates Vastupila's fight with
Samkha, and the defeat of the latter, whose precipitate flight back to Brguk-
achha has been suggested by saying that he took his breath only after he
reached his native town' (IV. 109). The canto ends with a description of
festivities in Stambhatīrtha to commemorate the defeat of the aggressor
(IV. 110-II). The three cantos which follow are devoted to traditional
descriptions. The sixth canto describes the six seasons, the seventh is devot-
ed to the descriptions of collection of flowers, pleasures of swinging and the
water-sports; and the sighth canto to the descriptions of love-sports, and
moon-rise.
158. The ninth canto says that when Vastupāla went to sleep at night
he saw a dream. Dharma, who had only one leg left came to him, and told
that he was four-legged in the Krtayuga, three-legged in the Tretā, two-legged
in the Dvāpara and one-legged in the present Kali age. Dharma says further,
"kings Mūlarāja and Sidhharāja propagated me by making pilgrimage to
Somanātha; Sidhharāja built a great temple called the Räjavihāra which was
like my pleasure-mountain, and gave twelve villages to the holy place of
Šatruñjaya to increase my splendour. Gone is that king and also his mother
Mayanalladevi, who abolished the tax on the pilgrims to Somanātha, which
was being collected at Bāhulod (modern Bholād near Dholkā), and instead
provided them with food and drink. Kumārapāla made pilgrimage to Satruñ-
jaya and Girnār, and built many temples. He repaired the shrines of Kedāra
and Someśvara, which were like two horns of mine, described as Vrsa
(bull). Kumārapāla also repaired the temple of Mūleśvara Mahādeva, built by
Mülarāja at Mandalī. But now that old splendour is gone. Where should the
adherents of different schools of philosophy go? I have described only a part
of the whole calamity. O great minister! Do act in a way that may remove
the affliction of my mind”. While Dharma spoke thus, Vastupāla was arous-
ed from his slumber (IX. 1-34). The rest of the canto (IX. 35-60) is devo-
ted to the songs of Vaitālikas, which praise Vastupāla in a poetic language

and describe sunrise at the same time. . Coming of Dharma in Vastupāla's
dream is a notable feature in this poem. Nowhere else in Jaina literature
or mythology Dharma is represented as a bull, who has been left with only
one leg in the Kali age. We find this type of description in the Bhāgavata
Purīua (I. ch. 16-17), which may have influenced Bālacandra to a certain
extent. The Naişadhiyacarita (1. 7) also refers to Dharma having four legs
in the Kitayuga. There was an intimate cultural contact between the
Brāhmanical and Jaina scholars at the courts of Anahilavād and Dhaval-
akka, and there is nothing to be wondered at if Bālacandra, who was a Brāh-
min before he became a Jaina ascetic (para 124), takes this motif from the
Bhagavata Purāņa, and makes its poetic application while delineating the life
of Vastupāla. Moreover, we may compare here the songs of Vaitālikas at
the end of canto IX with at least two such descriptions from Sanskrit liter.
ature-one from the Raghuvaṁsa (V. 65–76) and the other from the Naisadha
(XIX), in which while arousing Aja and Nala, respectively, from slumber,
the Vaitālikas describe sun-rise at length. The songs of the Vaitālikas in
the S'iśupālavadha (XI), while they arouse Krsna from sleep, also may be
compared..
159. Cantos ten to thirteen describe at length Vastupāla's pilgrimage,
which does not materially differ from the account given in the Kirtikaumudi
and the SukȚtasamkīrtana. In the fourteenth canto the poet says that the
number of religious places, temples, resting houses, dwelling places. for
the Brāhmins, and tanks built by Vastupāla at various towns, villages and
moutains is so great that it baffles the attempt of poets to count it,
like stars in the heaven ( XIV. 9-10). Then follows an allegory describing
Vastupāla's death, which is of particular interest, because it is not to be found
anywhere else: "Once, the old Age, the messenger of Dharma, töld Västúpāla
that Sadgati (felicity), daughter of Dharma, was longing for him and her
parents had decided to marry her to him. Absorbed in her thoughts, Vast-
upāla was attacked with fever of love, and resolved to go to Satruñjaya to
marry her. This resolve was brought to the notice of Dharma by his servant
Āyurbandha or limit of life. Dharma was pleased with the errand and fix-
ing the time for marriage, sent his messenger Sadbodha or good knowledge.
The messenger told Vastupāla that Dharma called him on mt. Satruñjaya
for marriage in the morning of sunday, the fifth day of the bright half of
Māgha, in samvat 1296. Vastupāla called his son Jaitrasimha, his wife
Lalitādevī, and his brother Tejapāla, and gave them instructions and advice
for their guidance. After seeing the king, he set forth for Satruñjaya. He
ascended the hill, and on the day of the marriage the temple of Adinātha
was profusely decorated. Dharma gave his daughter to Vastupāla before
Ādinātha, and then took him to heaven, where he was received with exultation
by the Lord of heaven". It is quite possible that the poet may have been
inspired in preparing this allegory by the Moharājaparājaya of Yaśaḥpāla,

describing. Kumărapāla's marriage to Kępāsundari, the daughter of king
Vivekacandra (para 32 ).
160. Aparājita Kavi has described Bālacandra as an adept in the Vaid-
arbhī style, and spoken very highly of his poetic capacities ( see the verse
quoted in the beginning of para 123). We may say that the praise is not
underserved, because though the life of Vastupāla was made the subject of
a Mahākāvya by two previous poets like Someśvara and Arisimha, Bālacandra
has acquitted himself quite worthily in writing a third one on the same theme.
His language is imbued with a distinct poetic fervour, which gives an imprint
of personality to his compositions. His descriptions, though generally long
and elaborate, are charming and full of vivid images. Description of Sarasvatī
appearing in the poet's Yoganidrā (I. 58–70); description of Anahilavā? (II),
which is a fine blending of the actual with the imaginative; short but striking
description of the port of Stambhatirtha (III. I7-23); realistic description
of the battle with Samkha, which refers to the actual historical participants
in the combat (V)-can be cited as some of the illustrations.
161. A verse put in the mouth of Vastupāla on the eve of his minist-
erial appointment is a charming example of Slesa —
अत्यर्थमर्थमुपढौकितमाद्रियन्ते तं च प्रभूतगुणितं पुनरर्पयन्ति ।
न्यस्ताः पदे समुचिते गमिताश्च मैत्री शब्दाः करिव नृपस्य नियोगिनः स्युः ।।
(III. 79)
And the following verse addressed to the king reminds a similar one
in the Kirtikaumudi (III. 77) quoted on p. 93-
न्यायं यदि स्पृशसि लोभमपाकरोषि कर्णेजपानपधिनोपि शमं तनोपि ।
सुस्वामिनस्तव धृतः शिरसा निदेशस्तन्नूनमेष मयकाऽपरथाऽस्तु भद्रम् ।।
(III. 80)
Crushing rejoinder to the messenger of Sankha, who suggested Vastu-
pāla to come in the former's service

A fine poetic fancy-

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASTUPĀLA
The Dharmābhyudaya or Samghapaticarita of Udayaprabhasüri
162. The Dharmābhyudaya or Samghapaticarita of Udayaprabhasūri
is another Kāvya in which we find Vastupāla as a character. I have taken
it last in this section on the historical Mahākāvyas, because only its two
cantos-first and last-contain matter which is historical, while the rest is
deroted to Dharmakathās based on Jaina mythology. The Dharmābhyud-
aya is divided into 15 cantos and at the end of each canto a few laudatory
verses in praise of Vastupāla are appended, the Granthāgra of the whole work
þeing 5041 ślokas.
163. The first canto begins with salutation to Jina, and then praises
the knowledge, scholarship and poetic merits of Gautama, the disciple of
Mahāvīra, Haribhadra, Sidhhasena Divākara, Hemacandra, Naracandra and
Vijayasena; speaks about the greatness of the Saṁgha or the four-fold Jaina
community comprising the Sādhu, Sädhvī, Śrāvaka and Srāvikā and eulogizes
the greatness of Vastupāla. After this the poet has mentioned in one verse
(I. 17 ) the name of his work, and given the genealogy of his spiritual precep-
tors (I. 18–25), right upto Vijayasenasūri. Then Vastupāla is described as
going to Vijayasena to hear religious instruction. The teacher tells him
about three kinds of Prabhāvanā Dharma, viz. Aştāhnikā festival, Ratha-
yātrā and Samghayātrā, and instructs about the ceremonials to be observed
while doing the Samghayātrā (I. 48–106).
164. Then the Acārya narrates to Vastupāla several Dharmakathās to
illustrate the religious merits to be attained by doing good to others, observing
celibacy and being merciful to other creatures. Cantos II-XIV are devoted to
such Kathās taken from the Jaina mythology. Cantos II-VI describe the life
of the first Tīrthamkara Rşabhadeva or Adinātha and also of his sons Bhar-
ata and Bāhubali, ending with the Nirvāṇa of Bharata. The sixth canto
gives a history of the Yaksa Kapardin, the guardian deity of Satruñjaya,
and dilates on the greatness of the temple built there by Bharata and later
on repaired by great men of the past, like Sagara Cakravartin, Rāmacandra,
Jāvada, Silāditya, and Āśuka and Bāhada, ministers of Sidhharāja and
Kumārapāla, respectively (VI. 67-83). This account, though in the nature
of a digression, is quite suitable in a work, the ultimate aim of which is to
describe a great pilgrimage to Satruñjaya. The eighth canto contains a life of
Jambusvāmin, who had taken the religious vow on the first night after marri.
age, having abandoned the eight beautiful wives, and the ninth canto gives
the story of a prince Yugabāhu to eulogize the fruits of penance. The cantos
X-XIV describe at great length the life of Neminātha, the 22nd Tirthamkara,
from his previous births upto his Nirvāụa, the Granthāgra of these five cantos
being 2142 ślokas. Contemporary history, again, comes into prominence
in the fifteenth canto, which describes the pilgrimage thus inspired by the
religious instructions of Vījayasenasūri. After the coming down of the Sam-
gha from Satruñjaya, two stations are mentioned which are not referred
to by any Kāvya treated before-they are Ajāhara Nagara? and Kotinagara
1 Ajābara is at present a small village near Unā in Southern Saurāştra,

CHAPTER VI - MAHĀKĀVYAS
103
(modern Kodinār on the southern coast of Saurāṣtra) (X1. 12). Verses
25-31 give a list of public works of Vastupāla, which is supported by other
contemporary writings. At the end, the author gives a Prasasti supplying a
genealogical list of the Acāryas of the Nāgendra gachha, to which he belonged
(vide para 111).
165. The poem has been characterized by the word Lakşmi, occuring in
the concluding verse of each canto, and has been called Lakşmyamka in the
colophons. To characterise their poems by words which were lofty and
auspicious was a well-established convention among the Sanskrit and Prākrit
poets, and in this connection I may point out that the Kirātārjunīva of
Bhāravi is characterized by the word Lakşmī, and Siśupālavadha of Nāgha
by the word Srī, the Setubandha of Pravarasena by Anuraya (skt. Anurāga ),
the Haravijaya of Ratnākara by Ratna, etc.
166. The Dharmābhyudaya is called a Mahākávya in the colophons at
the end of each canto;' we do not know if the colophons are from
the pen of the author or from that of Vastupāla who copied it; but the contents
of the work noted above would show that technically it cannot be called a
Mahākāvya, as it does not conform to the rules laid down for such a
composition. Really speaking, this is a Caritra or biographical account as
its alternative title, viz. Samghapaticaritra, suggests. Among the Jainas
there was a tradition of composing the Caritras of historical as well as
mythological personages, in the simple Purāna style, the principal metre
being the Anustup; such poems, including those comprising the lives of the
Tīrthamkaras were sometimes called the Mahākāryas, the title probably
signifying the lives of the great or the compositions which can be considered
great from religious point of view.. We cannot say that such works were
called Mahākāvyas through ignorance of the technique of the literary
Mahākāvya, because the lives of Tīrthamkaras written by well-known scholars
like Māuikyacandra are called Mahākāryas, though they do not conforin
to the rules laid down by Dandin and others (para 182 ).
167. The Dharmābhyudaya is a collection 'of several Kathās including
the lives of two Tirthamkaras, and the bulk of it has been written in easy,
flowing, but at the same time matter of fact style, which does not give much
scope to long descriptions and other poetic luxuries. This style is affected
in a number of Kathā-works written by the mediaeval Jaina authors both in
Sanskrit and Prākrit, in which the aim is to narrate rather than to describe.

mythology, it has a political and historical significance. It gives the story
of king Suratha contained in the Saptaśatī or Devīmāhātmya in the Adhyāyas
81-93 of the Mărkandeya Purāna, but presumably hints at the same time
at political misfortune and re-establishment of the power of king Bhimadeva
II, as suggested before (para 48 and 75).
169. The Surathotsava is divided in 15 cantos containing 1082 verses
in all. In the first canto the poet pays his homage to various deities, devoting
the first five stanzas to Bhavāni or Durgā. He then renders his obeisance
to him who “in the temple of his poem placed the image of the fame of
Rāma" and to the son of Satyavatī” as well as to their works, the Rāmāyaya
and the Mahābhārata. Several other poets are also mentioned with
admiration-Guụādhya, the author of the Brhatkathā, Subandhu, Kālidāsa,
Māgha and Murāri. In the words of Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar, who has
given an excellent summary of the Surathotsava in one of his reports,
"the poet then devotes a good many stanzas to such general subjects as
poetry, good men, wicked men, etc., and afterwards introduces his hero
Suratha to his readers. The first canto ends with the mention of his
Viśyavijaya or conquest of the world. At the beginning of the second
canto, soine of Suratha's counsellors are represented to have played into
the hands of his enemies, who with their assistance vanquished him and
deprived him of his kingdom. Suratha then betook himself to a forest, where
he met a Muni or säge to whom he recounted his misfortunes. He advised
him to have recourse to austere practices (tapas ) in order to propitiate
Bhavānī and narrated the glorious deeds of that goddess. Sumbha and
Niśumbha had obtained from Brahmadeva the boon of freedom from death
at the hands of any but a woman, and through the virtue of that boon they
made themselves all-powerful and oppressed all creatures. The gods
thereupon went to Brahmadeva and laid their complaints before him.
Brahmadeva explained to them the nature of the boon the demon had
received, and advised the gods to go to Umā or Bhayānī and entreat her
to kill S'umbha. Thus ends the third canto.
170. "The Gods then went to the Himālayas, a description of which
in accordance with the orthodox rules of poetry constitutes the fourth canto.
A description of the seasons, all of which came to wait upon the gods iu
the course of their march, follows in the fifth, and a description of moon-rise
in the siath. The seventh canto opens with a description of a sun-rise and
then Bhavani is represented as going out to gather flowers. Then she
goes to the Gamgā to bathe, and as she is returning the gods see her from
a distance and sing her praises. They then lay their complaints before her
and implore her to kill the Daitya S'umbha. She allays their fears and prom-
ises to destroy the demon. In the eighth canto, Bhavānī transforms herself
into a beautiful maiden and resides on a peak of the Himālayas. The report
spreads that a beautiful maiden has appeared on the Himālayas, and reached
the ears of S'umbha. He sends a person to propose to her a marriage with
himself. Bhavānī tells the messenger that she has vowed that that man
only shall be her husband who will fight with her while she is riding a lion,

Page 154****************************************************************************************
CHAPTER VI - MAHĀKAVYAS
105
The messenger goes back to S'umbha and informs him of this. S'umbha
wonders at the woman's oddity and sends a demon of the name of Dhum-
ralocana to induce her to give up what she called her vow, and, if she rema.
ined still obstinate, to use force and bring her away. Dhumralocana goes to
Bhavānī and while about to execute his master's commands, he is reduced
to ashes by the power of the goddess. Then in the ninth canto S'umbha
is represented as marching against Umā in person with a large army; the
fight between them is described in the tenth, and the death of S'umbha in
the eleventh.
171. "Having heard of this glorious deed of Bhavāni from the mouth
of the Muni, Suratha makes up his mind to propitiate her by the severest
austerities. These are described in the twelfth canto; and in the thirteenth,
Pārvatī sends a beautiful woman to test his firmness, but he is proof against
her blandishments and goes on with his religious exercises. Then in the
fourteenth, Bhavāni is pleased and manifests herself to Suratha; she pro-
nounces a benediction, and promises his supreme sovereignty for a thousand
years and the dignity of the eighth Manu, after the present or seventh is over,
in a future life. In the meanwhile, such of the counsellors of Suratha as were
faithful to him destroyed those who had acted as traitors and sent men in
all directions to trace him out. One of them reached at last the forest
where Suratha had been practising austerities and gave intelligence of his
being there to the counsellors. They then went to the place with a large
number of followers and conducted Suratha to his capital, where he enjoyed
supreme sovereignty in accordance with the promise of Umā.”] In the
fifteenth canto Someśvara gives the history of his family and his own and at
the end deyotes a few verses to the praise of Vastupāla. I have already
given a summary of this canto in the fifth chapter (para 69-71).
172. If Someśvara's Kirtikaumudi is written in the Vaidarbhi style, his
Surathotsava tries to affect the Gaudī style, and his model there seems to be
the Kirātārjunīya and Siśupālavad ha rather than the works of Kālidāsa. Though
the language of the Surathotsava is simple in comparision with these two diffi-
cult masterpieces of Sanskrit poetry, it abounds in Ślesas, in the use of rare
and umcommon words and the Sabdālamkāras. The tenth canto, which
describes the fight between the goddess and the demon is full of all kinds of
Citrakāvyas, just like the 15th canto of the Kirātārjunīya and the 19th canto
of the ſisupālavadha, which are also devoted to the description of fight and
contain the Citrakāvayas. It appears that there was a tradition among the
writers of Mahākāvya, which delighted in describing the fights by means of
various kinds of Citrakāvyas, though these were really speaking an obstacle to
the proper depicting of the tumultuous and rapid action of a battle.
173. The poetic merits of the author of the Kirtikaumudi are conspicuous
even in this poem. Some of Someśvara's descriptions here are such as can
· be compared with the best ones in the Kirtikaumudi. The description of God

plight (III), and that of the grandeur of the - Himalayas-full of alliterations
and puns (IV)-in which the poet may have been inspired to some extent by
the first canto of the Kumārasambhava, can be pointed out as illustrations.
The cantos IV and X are also notable, which are devoted to the descriptions
of the six seasons and battle-scenes, respectively,
174. I may quote here few verses illustrating Someśvara's poetic art in the
Surathotsava. When Suratha, deserted by his ministers, enters the woodlands
the poet gives a good example of Dhyanikāvya-
विशन् वनादेव वनान्तराणि सान्द्रद्रुमश्रेणिनिरन्तराणि ।
भाति म भिन्नाजनसंनिभानि धनादिवेन्दुर्धनमण्डलानि ॥
(II. I8)
Though the poem generally follows the difficult poetic models of
Bhāravi and Māgha, at some places we get a fine blending of simplicity and
real poetry. As for example, spring in the description of six seasons-
कटाक्षिता कैरपि चुम्बिता परैः कृतोपभोगा मधुपैश्च कैश्चन ।
मधु क्षरन्ती विरराज माधवी नवीनरूपा गणिकेव कामिभिः ।।

Beginning of spring:

(V.56)
It is generally believed that there is no clear mention of glass-bangles
in Sanskrit literature;a but it is noteworthy that VI. 105 expressly refers to
glass-bangles worn by women-
___ का च काचवलयावलिशब्दैराजुहाव हृदयं दयितास्य ।
which shows that the ornament was fairly common in Gujarat in the times
of Someśvara.
1 This verse is also found in the UR, II. 31.
2: "I have not come across any definite reference in Sanskrit literature to
the use of the glass-bangles, but I think that they began to be used
sometime about 8th-9th contury, i. e. in the early mediaeval period. Their
use seems to have been brought by the foreign tribes like the Hūņas and
the Gurjaras coming from Cental Asia"-Dr. V. S. Agrawala quoted by

CHAPTER VI - MAHĀKĀVYAS
107
The Naranārāyaṇānanda of Vastupāla
· 175. The Naranārāyaṇānanda is a Mahākāvya composed by Vastupāla,
Its subject-matter is taken from the Vanaparvan of the Mahābhārata and it
describes the friendship of Nara and Nārāyaṇa or Arjuna and Krəņa, their
rambles in the Raivataka park and the carrying away of Krsua's sister
Subhadrā by Arjuna. The poetic model of the author is Māgha and to a
certein extent Bhāravi. In the compositions of these two master-poets as well
as in that of Vastupāla, the theme is taken from the Mahābhārata, the subject-
matter is very scantly and large portions of the poems are taken up by
conventional descriptions such as those of the city', the king and his court,
the rise of the sun and the moon and gathering of flowers, and on certain
occasions by lengthy dialogues All the three poets have affected a style,
ornate and more artificial that artistic for the modern taste, though in this
respect Vastupāla is comparatively simple than his predecessors. Like
Bhāravi and Māgha, Vastupāla also has devoted one whole canto (XIV)
to the description of a fight by means of various kinds of Citrakāvyas,
and all the forty verses in that canto represent so many varieties of the
Citrakāvyas, some of them very rare even in the realm of ornate Sanskrit
poetry.
170:
176. The Naranārāyaṇānanda is divided in 16 cantos, comprising 794
natamenyanada
verses in all. It begins without any formal salutation to any deity, like
17
the Kumārasambhava, the Kirātārjunīya, and the S'iśupālavadha and
the Naişadha. The first canto describes the city of Dvārakā, the capital
of Krsna, and the second describes Krsya's assembly and his coming there.
Then the keeper of the Raivataka garden comes and presents him with
flowers and informs that Arjuna is staying in the garden. Krsna becomes
eager to see his dear friend, and in the third canto he comes to the
Raivataka and embraces Arjuna. Both the friends sit in a pleasure-grove
and talk. The fourth canto describes the six seasons which simultane-
‘ously held their sway in the Raivataka, and then the moon rises as if to
have a look at both these friends. The following three cantos ( V-VII) are
devoted to the descriptions of sun-set, moon-rise, drinking and love-sports,
-setting of the moon and the sun-rise. Arjuna and Kysua spent the whole
night in conversation. In the eighth canto Balabhadra, the brother of Kršņa
goes to Raivataka, and the poet takes the opportunity to give a description
of his army. The cantos nintha and tenth describe the flowers and the
water-sports. Beautiful Subhadrā was seen by Arjuna as she was returning
from her bath, and both were mutually attracted by love. Then Arjuna
and Kršņa enter Dyāravatī. The eleventh canto describes Arjuna's pangs
Prof. Handiqui as meaning 'glass-bangle' (Yaśastilaka and Indian Culture,
p. 123). It is difficult to say whether the meaning of the word of was
... extended to denote glass as distinct from natural crystal, which is its
usual meaning in Sanskrit. So our contention that the quotation from the
Surathotsaya contains the earliest indubitable reference so for discovered to
glass-bangles under the name 99% still holds good.

of separation, when a lady messenger of love comes and informs him about
Subhadrā's condition, who was equally love-smitten. Arjuna reads the
love-letter sent by Subhadrā and sends a word to her that she should meet
him in the Raivataka park. The twelfth canto describes Subhadrā going
to Raivataka for worshipping Kāmadeva, when Arjuna carries her away.
The watch-men inform Baladeva, who moved by anger taunts Krsya about
the behaviour of his dear friend, to which Krøya replies that Arjuna is a
worthy bridegroom for Subhadrā, and she is also deeply in love with
him, and hence there was no cause for Baladeva to become angry. The
cantos thirteenth and fourteenth describe the fierce battle between the
Yādava army on the one hand and Arjuna on the other. But in the end
Krsna intervenes, stops the fight and takes Arjuna back to Dvārakā. The
fifteenth canto describes the decorations and festive scenes in Dvārakā, and
the marriage of Arjuna and Subhadrā. In the last and the sixteenth canto
the poet gives an autobiographical account beginning from his ancestor
Caụdapa, and ends the work with the following verse expressing humility:
उद्भाव द्विश्वविद्यालयमयमनसः कोविदेन्द्रा वितन्द्रा
मन्त्री बद्धाञ्जलिर्वो विनयनतशिरा याचते वस्तुपालः ।
स्वल्पप्रज्ञाप्रबोधादपि सपदि मया कल्पितेऽस्मिन् प्रबन्धे
भूयो भूयोऽपि यूयं जनयत नयनक्षेपतो दोषमोषम् ॥
Some poet patronized by Vastupāla has appended one or two verses
in his praise at the and of each canto. The number of such verses iş
18 in all.
177. The Naranārāyaṇānanda appears to have established itself in the
poetic world within a short time after its composition, as the sixth verse of
its first canto is quoted in the Sūktimuktāvali of Jahlana (vide para 64), and
one more verse (XIV. 16) is to be found in the Kāvyakalpalatā (p. 103) of
Amaracandrasūri. As we have seen, the bulk of the poem is taken up by
conventional descriptions, but even there the poetic distinction does not
remain concealed, and there are a number of poetic flashes which remind us
of beautiful verses from Bhāravi and Māgha, and even the poem as a whole
maintains a certain level, which is not to be commonly found in the authors
of the Sanskrit Mahākāvyas during the mediaeval times. Suggesting beauti-
fully the apparent contradictions in Krsua's character the poet says:
पुपोष मित्राण्यपि निर्ममोऽसौ गतस्पृहो राज्यमपि प्रतेने।
जघान शत्रूनपि शान्तचेताः प्रभुः प्रजैकार्थकृतावतारः॥
(I. 42)
And the meeting of Krşua and Arjuna in Raivataka after a very long
time:
उरसि रसिकयोस्त्रयोः प्रमोदाद् दृढपरिरम्भविभिन्नभूषणेऽपि ।
द्रुतमतनुत तारहारलक्ष्मी स्मितरुचिविच्छुरिताश्रुबिन्दुपतिः ।।

A fine fancy about the disappearance of darkness at the time of sunrise:

The Bālabhārata of Amaracandrasūri
178. The Bālabhārata of Amaracandrasūri is a sort of epitome, in its
subject-matter, of the famous Mahābhārata, as its very name suggests. The
author has called it a Mahākāvya, and being characterized by the word Vīra at
the end of each canto, this poem as well as his Padmānanda Mahākāvya are
known as Vīrāmka. Like its prototype, the Bālabhārata is divided into 18
Parvans, each of which is further subdivided into one or more contos, the
sum total being 44, including the last canto which gives the Prasasti. The
Granthāgra of the whole work, as given in the last verse of the last canto is
6950 slokaś. The author has so arranged the work as to look like a Mahākāvya,
adhering to certain technicalities laid down by the writers on poetics, though
the subject-matter of the Mahābhārata is too bulky to be condensed in a single
Mahākāvya. In the beginning of every canto except the last, the author has
devoted one verse to the praise of Vyāsa, thus praising him 43 times in 43
verses, a fact which shows his great respect for the author of the original epic.
The seventh canto of the Adiparyan is devoted to the description of the spring
and cantos eight to eleven to collection of flowers and water-sports, moon-
rise, drinking and love-sports, etc. The twelfth canto gives a splendid
description of the Khāụdava-forest, which was burnt by Arjuna. We find
description of seasons in the fourth canto of the Sabhāparvan, and that of
fights in the Droua and Bhīsmaparvans. The author has depicted the
sentiment of pathos in the Strīparvan, when the women of the Kaurava
family are mourning the loss of their kith and kin.
179. But inspite of all these efforts to present the work as a Mahākāvya,
it is more of an outline summary of the story of the Mahābhārata rather than
a real Mahākāvya of the literary type. In compressing the original, Amara.
candra has concentrated on the story-part of the Mahābhārata, almost
omitting its didactic and religious matter. That is why the Parvans from the
description of in and loves to collecis devote

wished that Vastupāla should pass through that ordeal as the latter was
suspected by him of mismanaging the state-revenue, but the king was
checked by Lavanaprasādą, who was living at that time,

Adi to the Udyoga are given a considerable space, while the Sānti and the
Anušāsana Parvans which are the main didactic and religious portions of
the Mahābhārata are allotted only one canto each. The story of all the latter
Parvans is also told very briefly. Though the work of a Jaina ascetic,
the Bālabhārata was very well-known in the Brāhmanical literary world, and
that popularity is to be accounted for by the fact that this poetical synopsis
of the famous epic, though faithfully following the original, is an independent
Kāvya at the same time.
The Padmānanda Mahākāvya of Amaracandrasuri
180. The Padmānanda Mahākāvya or Jinendracarita is another work of
Amaracandra, which is midway between a Mahākāvya in the technical sense
and a religious Caritra. The work has for its subject the mythical account
of the first Jaina Tīrthamkara Adinātha. It is divided into 19 cantos, and
its Granthāgra is 6281 ślokas.' The religious Caritras generally prefer one
principal metre, viz. Anusțup, while this work has tried all the well-known
metres of classical Sanskrit poetry in the style of the Mahākāvya and has
devoted one whole canto (XI) to the description of the seasons. In addition
to the life of Adinātha, the hero, it includes a number of legends and anec-
dotes, religious and philosophical discourses and discussions, which reveal
its character as a sectarian work, Inspite of the didactic material it does not
lack poetic quality. The author, in this Kāvya, appears to be particularly
fond of the Arthāntaranyāsas, and we find a number of verses which would
be highly prized as Subhāṣitas. The author shows a mastery, over classi-
cal Sanskrit and its literary diction.
: Caturviṁs'ati-Jinendra-Samkşipta-Caritāni by Amaracandra
181. It would be apposite here to treat of the Caturvimśati-Jinendra-
Samkşipta-Caritāni, though it is neither a Mahākāvya nor a long Caritra of
one Tirthamkara. If the Padmānanda Mahākāvya is an account of the first
Jina, this work supplies short accounts of all the 24 Jinas, including the first,
and as such forms as if an appendix to the former, though composed before
it (para 106). It is divided into 24 chapters and comprises 1802 blokas
in all. The author has to treat of all the Jinas in a short space and naturally
he does not get scope for any poetic luxuries. The main topics treated in
every chapter, that is, in case of every Jina, may be outlined as under:(1) The
previous birth or births, (2) the parentage, (3) explanation of the proper name
given to the Tirthamkara, (4) the days of entering the embryo, birth, renun-
ciation and salvation, (5) the height of the Caitya-vřksa, (6) the Parivāra con-
sisting of the Ganadharas (apostles), male and female ascetics, those conver-'
sant with the 14 Püryas, those having the Avadhi-ſñāna and the Manahpar-
yava-Jñāna, the Kevalins, those endowed with the Vaikriya-labdhi (power to

both sexes etc., and (7) the duration of life with the specification of the peri-
ods passed as a youth, a crown-prince, a ruler (where possible), a Chadmastha
(one who is imperfect) and an omniscient being."
The S'āntināthacaritra and Pārs'yanāthacaritra of Māņikyacandra
182. Lastly, we come to the poetical compositions of lānikyacandra-
viz. his S'āntināthacaritra and Pārsvanāthacaritra, which are called Mahākāvyas
in the colophons of the manuscript copies, according to the tradition among
the Jainas which many a times referred to the cligious Caritras as the
Mahākāvyas, as mentioned before (para 166). S'āntitātha is the 16th
Tīrthamkara, while Pārsvanātha is the 23rd, and the lives of these two Jinas
along with those of several others, viz. Adinātha, Neminātha and Nahāvīra,
form the most popular literary themes for the Jaina poets, and a large
number of poems both in Sanskrit and Prākrit have been written about
these two Jinas. Both the works are not printed as yet, and are available
only in manuscript-form. The Sāntināthacaritra is divided into eight cantos
and its Granthāgra is 5574 blokas,* while the Pārsvanāthacaritra has nine
cantos having the Granthāgra of 5278 slokas. The bulk of both the works
is devoted to the previous births of Jinas ( 6 cantos in former work, while 4
cantos in the latter ). The narrative of these poems generally follows the fifth
and ninth Parvans of the Trişasti-salākāpuruşacaritra of Hemacandra, which
gave, respectively, the lives of these two Tirthamkaras, and also the relevant
portions of the Adipurāņa of Jinasena and Uttarapurāna of Gunabhadra.
Both the works are written in the simple Purāṇa style, the principal metre
being Anustup, and the legend of these two Jinas forms the frame-work into
which numerous stories, fables and fairy-tales are inserted in the manner
so familiar in Indian narrative literature. In no way do the contents
conform to the technical requirements of the Mahakāvya, but being the
compositions of a renowned scholar like Māņikyacandra these two works
present good examples of Jaina narrative poetry.

Characteristics of Sanskrit drama
183. Drama is another popular form of Sanskrit literature, which is
considered to be the highest poetic achievement of Sanskrit authors. It can
show a continuous history of more than twenty centuries, from the times of
Ašvaghosa upto the most recent times. The earliest form of dramatic litera-
ture in India is represented by the Rgveda-dialogues between Saramă and
Paui, Yama and Yamī, Viśvāmitra and the rivers, Pururavas and Urvasi etc.,
the last one being the first version of the Pururayas-Urvaśī story, which
forms the subject-matter of a famous play by Kālidāsa, viz. his Vikramo-
rvasīya. Oldest references to the acted drama are to be found in the Mahā.
bhāsya (about 120 B. C.), which mentions the performance of Kamsavadha
or slaying of Kaṁsa and Balibandha or binding of Bali, two episodes from
the life of Vişnu. From this and from several other references it is believed
that the Sanskrit drama was developed in connection with the cult of Vişnu-
Krşņa, and that the earliest acted representations were, therefore, like
the mysteries of the Christian middle ages. That the drama had a
rich and varied development in India is also attested by the fact that
in addition to a large number of plays there are a number of elaborate treati-
ses on dramaturgy and acting, the oldest being the Nātyaśāstra of Bharata
(circa 300 A. D.). The Sanskrit drama is generally divided into two varieties-
Rūpaka and Uparūpaka. The Sāhityadarpaņa of Viśyānātha (circa 1450 A.D.)
divides the Rūpaka into ten varieties and the Uparūpaka into eighteen.
184. The number of acts in a play varies from one to ten. The variety
known as Nātikā has four acts, while the minor dramatic types like Praha.
sana, Bhāụa etc. have only one act. Every Sanskrit play begins with a
prologue, which opens with Nândī or benediction invoking the favour of God
for the welfare of the audience. Then follows a dialogue between the Sūtradhāra
or stage-manager and one or two actors, which gives some information
about the play and its author, and introduces at the end, one of the characters
of the plot in a particularly dramatic situation. The stage does not remain
vacant until the end of the act and no change in locality takes place until
then. Before a new act begins, sometimes an interlude known as the Viskam-
bhaka or Praveśaka is inserted, which makes the audience aware of the events
which occurred during the interval between the two acts, and mentally prepares
them for the events which are to occur. The play closes with a Bharatavākya
or the prayer for general prosperity and it is put in the mouth of one of the
principal elderly characters of the play. The Sanskrit play is a mixed compo-
sition containing prose-dialogues and lyrical verses. The dialogues are some-
times very commonplace serving only to introduce lofty lyrical stanzas, which
describe the scenes, situations or personalities or sometimes contain high

113
reflections. It is also well-known that different characters in a Sanskrit play
speak different dialects according to their social position. Heroes, kings,
Brāhmins, and other men of high social status speak Sanskrit, while Prākrit is
spoken by women and also by men of lower social status. Even in case
of Prākrit, its different sub-dialects are employed for those persons, according
to the rules prescribed in the Natyaśāstra. The story is always terminated
"happily, and there is no tragedy as such in Sanskrit drama. Not only that,
nothing deeply tragic, e. g. death, is allowed to occur on the stage. The
texts on dramaturgy allow nothing very harsh or indecorous on the stage, and
the audience never witnesses such things like the utterance of a curse, fighting,
kissing, eating and sleeping.
185. Though the number of the extant Sanskrit plays can be counted by
several hundreds, the best specimens which number not more than twenty,
are from the pen of the ancient masters like Bhāsa, Kālidāsa, Sūdraka,
Višākhadatta, Harsa and Bhavabhūti. Many of the later authors have taken
some composition of one of these older writers as a model, and thus have more
or less imitated the creations of a more vital dramatic tradition. Even when
the creative period in the history of Sanskrit drama as well as literature
in general came to an end by the early mediaeval times, the scholastic
traditions were zealously maintained, and theory and practice of drama
were being cultivated at the royal courts and under the patronage of
the richer section of the society. As already pointed out in the first chapter,
not only were a number of dramas composed and performed in Gujarāt of
the Caulukya period, but Hemacandra also wrote on dramatic theory in the
eighth chapter of his Kāvyānuśāsana and his pupil Rāmacandra, who was him-
self a dramatist, wrote the Nātyadarpana, a voluminous work on dramaturgy.
During the times of Vastupāla, i. e. in the later Caulukya period also this
tradition continued, and we know about five plays composed by the poets
in the literary circle of Vastupāla, out of which one, viz. the Kākutsthakeli of
Narendraprabhasūri is not extant. We shall make here a critical survey of
the remaining four.
The Ulāgharāghava of Somes'vara
186. First we take the Ullāgharāghava of Someśvara, a play in eight acts,
dramatizing the story of the Rāmāyana. The only available manuscript of
this very rare work, which has remained almost unknown to the students of
the Sanskrit drama, is preserved in the Bombay Government collection
of manuscripts deposited at the Bhandarkar Institute, Poona (no.
343 of 1884-86), and even in that, eleven folios in all (1-5, 18, 39, 40, 71,
73 and 87) are missing. Thus we miss the historically very important
prologue in this manuscript, but I was fortunate enough to get that portion
from a copy of the work made by the late Mr. T. M. Tripāthī of Bombay,
who had taken down the whole of the Poona manuscript, but had supple-
1 Though this has been a general rule in the later Sanskrit drama, it appears
that in earlier plays like the Urubhamga of Bhāsa, the convention was not
observed, for we find Duryodhana dying on the stage in that short drama.

the inn, angry. Pan After a
mented the missing section from some other manuscript, which I was unable
to discover from his pricate collection. The Granthāgra of the play is 2100
blokas, as is noted in a later hand on the last folio of the Poona manuscript.
187. Looking to the contents of the play~in act I, after the Nandi,
Satānanda, the Purohita of Janaka, refers to the grief of the king that his
daughter Sītā will now be separated from him, that is, the play begins after the
marriage of Rāma and Sītā. Dasaratha and his two sons and Sītā take
Tanaka's leave and start for their capital. After a while the chamberlain
Haridatta informs how, on the way, angry Paraśurāma was pacified by Rāma,
and Janaka goes to inform the inmates of the harem about this great success
of his son-in-law. From a Viskambhaka in the beginning of act II, containing
a dialogue between two servants, we know that Dasaratha has decided to
install Rāma as the king and has called for his Purohita Vasistha. Then
Rāma and Sītā, with the garden-keeper, move about the pleasure-garden
and the pleasure-pond, and enjoy the beauty of the place. Meanwhile
Dasaratha calls Rāma and bids him to remain ready to take charge of the
onerous duties of state-affairs. It is the time of evening, and the stanzas of
the Vaitālikas describing the evening twilight are heard from the back-ground.
The chamberlain informs Daśaratha that queen Kaikeyi requests him to
come to her place. Before going there, the king again tells. Rāma to remain
ready for the coronation-ceremony. In act III, from the conversation of two
maid-servants it is inferred that Kaikeyi has decided to obtain two gifts from
the king which the latter had promised her some time ago, and that one was
the banishment of Rāma and the other was the coronation of Bharata in his
place. Then Rāma drives in state to the palace, witnessing the festivities in
the city, but coming to the residence of Kaikey7, he and Sumantra find the old
king vainly attempting to persuade the queen, so that she may not insist upon
her demands. The king faints when he sees Rāma. At this juncture enter
Kausalyā, Sumitrā and Sītā, and are stunned to know the turn which the events
have taken. Angry Laksmana enters with drawn bow, asking who is bold
enough to banish Rāma. But Rāma pacifies him, and bidding farewell to all
retires to the forest, and grief prevails in the whole kingdom.
188. The whole of act IV is utilized for supplying information regarding
the events that occurred after the banishment of Rāma. The act is devoted
to the aerial travel and conversation of two Gandharvas-Kumudāmgada and
his son Kanakacūļa. We know that Dasaratha is dead; Bharata follows
· Rāma to Citrakūta, but there he is prevailed upon by Rāma to return to
Ayodhyā for the protection of the people; Rāma has killed the demon Virā-
dha; and in the end, he expresses a desire to go to the southern direction.
Act V has a Viskambhaka in the beginning, in which the audience know from
the soliloquy of Mārīoa that Rāvaụa wants to take his help in the abduction
of Sītā and that the ears and nose of Sūrpanakhã were cut by Laksmana and

115
also that the demons residing in the Janasthāna were killed. Then enters
Rāvana and forcibly carries away Sītā. Jațāyu, king of the vultures, comes
to Sītā's help, and fights with Rāvaņa, but he is not successful, and from the
speech of Ghorāksa, Rāvana's attendent, we know that Jatāyu is fatally
wounded. Rāma and Laksmana, not finding Sītā in the hut, start for her
Search, and know the details of her carrying away from Jatāyu. Jatāyu advi-
ses Rāma to go to the Pampāsaras in the south, where he will make friends
with Sugrīva and other monkey-chiefs, and thus a suggestion is made as to
how it will become possible for Rāma to attack Lamkā. Act VI begins
with the dialogues of three demons, viz. Mālyavān, Sãrana and Sūka, from
which the audience know that Vāli was killed by Rāma and that Hanuman had
burnt Lamkā; Vibhişaņa advised Rāvana to return Sītā to Rāmā, but he was
insulted and consequently went over to Răma's camp. Then Amgada comes
to Rāvaya's court for a peace-mission, but his mission fails and there follows
an interchange of recriminations. The battle-cries of the monkeys are heard
from the background, Rāvana, from the terrace of his palace, takes a view
of Rāma's army, and the chief warriors are pointed out to him by Sūka. In
the same way Rāma and Vibhīşaņa see Rāvana's army from the peak of
mountain Suvela.
189. Almost the whole of act VII is a dialogue between Kāpatika, who
was a spy of Lavaụa, the lord Mathurā and a friend of Rāvaụa, and a demon
named VỊkamukha. We know that Rāvaya has been killed, Sită has
come out pure from the fire and Vibhisaụa is installed on the throne of
Lamkā. Kāpatika says that he would try his best still to create difficulties
in the way of Rāma. In the end, Vibhisana's voice is heard from the
background requesting Rāma to sit in the aerial car Puspaka for going to
Ayodhyā. Act VIII begins with the aerial journey of Rāma to Ayodhyā.
Sitā asks him about various places coming on the way and he satisfies her
curiosity, Kāpatika takes the guise of a young Muni, and hastily goes to
Ayodhyā where the news of Rāvana's death have not reached as yet.
There he gives false information that Rāvaņa in his aerial car is coming
to attack Ayodhyā having killed both Rāma and Lakşmana. The army
is ordered to remain ready and Kausalyā and Sumitrā, struck with grief,
prepare for burning themselves alive. At this juncture enters the aerial car,
Bharata aims an arrow at Vibhişana taking him to be an ally of
Rāyaṇa, but Vasistha who knows everything checks him, and the plot
of Kāpatika is found out. The concluding portion of the play (folio 87 )
is missing, but it can be easily surmised that it must have depicted the
reunion of the family, and in the end there must have been a Bharatavākya
in the mouth of Rāma. We may mention here that in the beginning of each
act, except the first, the poet has put one verse in praise of Vastupāla, which
speaks of his close association with the patron.
190. Thus the Ullāgharāghava is a long drawn out play, possibly
having as its model the Anargharāghava of Murāri ( before the gth century
A. D.), a play in seven acts. There is a series of Rāma-dramas, ending

Page 165****************************************************************************************
116
LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASTUPALA
with the word Rāghava, which seem to have some connection with one
another. We are in darkness regarding the Udāttarāghava of Māyurāja,
which is known only by reference, and we are not able to say anything
about its relation with the Anargharāghava of Murāri, who may either have
succeeded him or preceded him. Murāri seems to have been imitated by
Jayadeva (circa 1200 A. D.) in the Prasannarāghava, which is also a
Rāma-play in seven acts. Murāri's play was very popular in Sanskrit
literature, at a time, and he has been spoken of very highly in anthologies,
and a large number of commentaries were written on his play. The play was
zealously read and studied also in mediaeval Gujarāt, and Naracandra
and his Guru Devaprabha, both of them contemporaries of Vastupāla, have
composed commentaries on it. A third commentary was written by
Jinaharsa in the 15th century. And it is no wonder if Someśvara was
influenced by it. Just as act IV of the Ullāgharāghava is entirely taken
up by the dialogue of two Gandharvas, Kanakacūda and Kumudāmgada,
the later part of act VI of the Anargharāghava is similarly devoted to the
talks between Ratnacūda and Hemāṁgada, who are also Gandharvas,
These dialogues in both the plays serve the same purpose, viz. to inform
the audience about the events that have already occurred. Dialogues of
Mälyavān, Sūka and Sāraya are found almost in identical places in act
VI in both the plays. VIII. 29–30 of the Ullāgharāghava are mere
imitation of the VII. 97–98 of the Anargharāghava; and the whole of the
act VIII in the former play seems to have been inspired by act VII of the
latter, though here one may be tempted, to say that the poet may have
also seen the portions describing Rāma's return to Ayodhyā in canto XIII
of the Raghuvamsa and act X of the Bālarāmāyaṇa of Rājasekhara
(circa 900 A. D.).
191. The Ullāgharāghava betrays some influence of the Abhijñâna-
sākuntala. The scenes in which Sītā goes to Ayodhyā and the grief of
Janaka at the separation from his dear daughter is expressed-are reminiscent
of similar scenes in the fourth act of the great drama of Kālidāsa. When
Someśvara wrote-
नवपरिणीता दुहिता गच्छन्ती पतिगृहाय बन्धूनाम् ।
परमार्थवेदिनामपि वैक्लव्यं विरचयत्येव ।
(I. 10)
he must have in his mind the following half-verse from the Sakuntalā,
put in Kanva's mouth-

name by the plays like the Anargharāghava.

And Satānanda's instruction to Sītā-
शुश्रूषा श्वशुरे ननान्दृषु नतिः श्वश्रूयु यांजलिः (१ बद्धांजलि: ?)
पत्यो तत्परता सुनर्म च वचस्तन्नित्रवर्ग शुचौ ।

(I. 21)
appears to have been based on the famous verse in the Sakuntalā spoken by
Kayva, beginning with the words TTT TETO (IV. 17). In the second act of
the Ullāgharāghava, Rāma protects Sītā from the bee which was attracted
by the fragrance of her mouth and addresses him a verse Tê TT HITO
(II. 35), which is inspired by a similar scene in the first act of the Sakuntală
and the verse 971975İ TPEO (I. 20).
192. The Sanskrit drama was generally under the influence of the
court, and though the audience was mixed, its worth was judged by the
learned who were intent on discerning poetic beauties or defects. The result
was that the poet attempted to introduce as many lyric verses as he could,
and consequently the action and dialogues suffered. This process can be
seen in full development in Murāri, Rājasekhara and other later dramatists,
in whom we find subordination of action to description, and the degeneration
of the description into a mere exercise in style and in the use of alliteration."
We find these features also in Someśvara, he being the child of his age. At
some places he has made the things too lengthy, e. g., whole of the fourth
act is devoted to the long and tedious dialogues between two Gandharvas, the
second act describes the beauties of the garden, and a part of the last act
gives large number of verses in epic style about several geographical places
from Lamkā to Ayodhyā. This was partly due to the fact that the plays
for their reputation depended largely on being read, not witnessed, however
important it may have been for the poet to secure the honour of public
performance,
193. But the merit of Someśvara's work lies in the fact that though it
exhibits all these characteristics of the later drama, prose as well as verses
in it are written in an elegant and effective style, which has always marked
his compositions, as we have seen before. He has tried to dramatize the
whole of the Rāmāyaṇa, but has utilized his long and unwieldy subject-matter
in a judicious way, as a result of which his acts generally do not degenerate
into something like separate plays, as has happened in case of the Bālarāmāy-
aņa of Rajasekhara. A number of lyric verses can be cited as poetic achi-
evements of Someśvara. Rāma being abashed at his praise for his valour
before Paraśurāma, expresses exemplary modesty-

मातः क्षिते तपनतात विभो नभस्वन् सर्वं हि वित्थ तदिदं वदत प्रसह्य ।
का दुर्दशेयनधुना मन वर्तते यन्नूी तु गच्छति न गच्छति जीवितव्यम् ।।
(III. 18)
Touching farewell of Rāma to Ayodhyā and its people-
भास्वगोत्रचरित्रचित्ररुचिरप्रासाद तुभ्यं नम-
स्त्वां वन्दे सुकृतानुरक्तजनतामेथ्यामयोध्यां पुरीम् ।
आपृच्छे पुरवासिनः सविनयं युष्मानिहायुष्मति

(III. 35)
And a charming description of the moon-rise-
ब्रह्मास्त्रं मन्मथस्य त्रिभुवनवनितामानमीनावकृष्टये
कैवर्तः कैरवाणां प्रियसुहृदमृतस्रोतसां शैलराजः।

(IV. 53)
Rāma's dejection when he knew that Sītā was carried away-
दृष्टिः स्पष्टं तटगतमपि वीक्षते नाश्रुमिश्रा
दूराहाने न हि पटुरयं बाष्पकुण्ठश्च कण्ठः। .

The Datāmgada of Subhata-a. Chaya Nataka.
194. The Dūtāmgada of Subhata is a brief one-act play depicting the
peace-mission of Amgada to Ravana's court. It is interesting to note that
the poet does not make claim to originality, but on the contrary says that
he has borrowed from former poets. A number of verses in this play have
been traced to other works. The latter half of the first benedictory verse is
quoted by Namisādhu ( 1069 A. D.) in his commentary on the Kāvyālamkāra
(II. 8) of Rudrata. The fifth verse is found in the Hitopadesa (circa 900
A. D.) and in several recensions of the Pañcatantra, while the ninth is quoted
by Ksemendra (Inth century A. D.) in his Suvrttatilaka (p. 13), ascribing it
1 स्वनिर्मितं किञ्चन गधपंचबन्धं कियत् प्राक्तनसत्कवीन्द्रैः।
प्रोक्तं गृहीत्वा प्रविरच्यते स रसाढ्यमेतत्सुभटेन नाट्यम् ॥ (last verse)

to Bhavabhūti. Moreover, Subhata has taken a number of verses from the
Bālarāmāyaṇa? of Rājasekhara, and also from the Vahūnātaka. It is quite
possible that a number of other verses also may be from the older poets.
195. In the beginning of the play we find that Ampada is appointed
to go to the court of Rāvana to demand the return of Sītā. Then enters
Rāvaņa, and with him his queen Mando darī and brotner Vibhīsaņa, who
entreat him to make peace with Rāmı, but Rīyawa gets enraged at the
suggestion and drives away his brother. At this juncture the door-keeper
announces the arrival of Amgada, and some heated conversation follows
between Răma's messenger and Rāvana. Then enters the apparition of
Sītā created by the Rāksasa's magic, which sits on Rāvana's lap, and
Amgada is quite puzzled to see it. But the next moment two Rāksasīs
come, bringing the news that Sitā is trying to commit suicide hearing some-
thing untoward about Rāma, and Amgada is delighted to know that the
form in Rāvana's lap is not real Sītā. Rāvana declines to hand back Sītā
and Añgada returns after trying to impress upon him the power of Rūma;
we learn shortly afterwards that Rāvana has met his doom.
Interpretation of the word Chāyā Nātaka; Characteristics
of the Chāyā Nātaka
196. The prose-portion in the play is very scanty, and the bulk of
the play is taken up by verses, a number of which are borrowed material,
as I have just pointed out. Poetic merits of the work are negligible, but
it is important from another point of view, because it is called a Chāyā
Nāțaka or shadow-play in the prologue, and is one of the oldest available
works among the Sanskrit plays to which the technical name Chāyā Nātaka
is applied. This type of drama is not mentioned in the list of Rūpakas
and Uparūpakas, and we have to ask the question—what is meant by the
Chāyā Nāțaka ? We get some clue to the characteristics of this type of
drama from another play, viz. Dharmābhyudaya of Meghaprabhācārya,
which is called a Chāyā Nātya Prabandha, and in which a definite stage-
direction is found, to the effect that, when the king expresses his intention
to become an ascetic, a puppet is to be placed inside the curtain in the
attire of an ascetic (996arate Qatari FFT 7114:, P. 15). Unfortuna-
tely, the date of the Dharmābhyudaya cannot be finally settled, but it is
certain that it was composed before 1217 A. D. (= 1273 V, S.), because a
palm-leaf manuscript of the work written in that year is preserved in the
1 Verses 46, 47, 51, 52, 53 and 54 are to be traced respectively to IX. 53, IX.
55, IX, 56, IX. 58, IX. 59 and X. 21 of the Bālarāmāyaṇa.
2 Keith, op. cit., p. 269 n.
3 Keith, op. cit., p. 55. It is interesting to note that the Ullāgharāghava
of Someśvara has been called a Chāyā Nāçaka in the colophon in the
Poona manuscript at the end of the third act, as follow-fà ftatuit:
श्रीसोमेश्वरदेवस्य कृतावुल्लाघराघवे छायानाटके चतुर्थोङ्कः । Other acts have no colophons,
and the play is not described as a Chāyā Nātaka in the prologue or the
Prasasti; and this single reference remains only a matter of curiosity,

Gujaratitlic life of as its manuscript
Samgha Birņdār at pāțan. The play has taken as its theme the life of
a Jaina sage named Dasārnabhadra, it was acted in a temple of Pārsvanātha,
as mentioned in the prologue, and its author was a Jaina Sādhu most
probably from Gujarāt, as its manuscripts are found in Gujarāt. Samāmſtam,
delineating the life of Neminātha, by some unknown Jaina author from
Gujarāt, is another short play which has been called a Chāyā Nātaka in the
prolcgue (...1997: SfiataFTLIGT 951FETTO È faaf: THEPETITEETSE TYT SAATTORI
TATER FIH J1291728#PATATI I p. I). The date of this play is not known.
197. In any case, we might conclude that the Chāyā Nátaka was a
literary piece to be recited by the performers of puppet-show. The word
Chāyā Nātaka can be translated as "imitation-play", i. e., a play with a lot
of verbal borrowings from other literary works. This applies to the
Dūtāṁgada, as just pointed out (para 194). Rajendralal Mitra, however,
gives a different interpretation, and identifies the Chāyā Nātaka with the
entracte in a play. He explains the word Chāyā Nāțaka as "drama in the
form of a shadow", i. e., reduced to the minimum for representation in such a
form. But the Dūtāñgada, the Dharmābhyudaya and the śamāmịtam do
not give any clue which would help us in deciding if this interpretation is
correct. Professor Luders has taken the Dūtāmgada as the type of the
Chāyā Nātaka, and thence deduced its characteristics; viz.- the prevalence
of verse-often epic in character-over prose, the absence of Prākrit, the
large number of characters, and the omission of the Vidūsaka; and
on this basis has considered the Mahānātaka and the Haridūta also
as Chāyā Nātaka. But we cannot take these characteristics as peculiar
to the Chāyā Nāțaka, because the Dūtāmgada, the Samāmrtam and the
Dharmābhyudaya have some Prākrit dialogues, and in the case of the
last work the prose-portion predominates over the verses, unlike in
the Dūtāmgada. Any way, it is certain from these three works which
are called Chāyā Nāțakas by their authors, that the Chāyā Nātaka was a
short and simple composition in one act. But we are left in the dark
regarding its other characteristics and the exact manner of its representation,
Whatever part the shadow-plays of puppets might have played in the
evolution of the Sanskrit dramas the literary type known as the Chāyā
Nāțaka appears to be comparatively late, because it has been never alluded to
in works on dramatic theory. Whatever may be the correct interpretation
of the word Chāyā Nāțaka, we can say with certainty that the three extant
Chāyā Nātakas, viz. the Dūtāmgada, the Samāmrtam and Dharmābhyudaya,
are from Gujarāt, and if they really indicated shadow-play, one may say
that in mediaeval Gujarāt recitation of elegant Sanskrit prose and verse must
have accompanied these puppet-plays.

ndra. It has taken for its theme the Jaina version of the famous legend /
king Sibi and the pigeon occurring in the Vanaparvan of the Mahābhārata an
also in the Jātaka (no. 499). In the Jaina story, the hero is king Vajrāyudh:
who is the Tirthamkara Sāntinātha in one of his former births, and it occui
in its oldest form in the 21st chapter of the Vasudeva-Hindi of Samghadās
.(circa 500 A. D.), and later on in the fifth Parvan of Trişastiśalākāpuruşacari
ra of Hemacandra and in numerous other works. In the prologue of tł
play the Sūtradhāra gives good many details about Vastupāla and his anci
stors and also about the poet and his spiritual teachers. Then follows a Visl
ambhaka, containing a dialogue between two dancing-teachers narned Kalal
amsa and Kalakaytha, from which we know that king Vajrāyudha has onl
recently returned after accomplishing a world-conquest, and that he is a ma
of great piety. Kalahamsa infers from the throbbing of both of his eyes thi

following verse

on which the fruition of the main action in the play is based. Meanwhile
a great uproar is heard from the background, and a frightened dove chase
by a hawk enters. The dove seeks shelter from the king, which the latte
is ever-ready to extend, but the hawk is very hungry and demands his food
and faints. The king offers him sweet-balls, but he being a carnivorous anin
al can not partake of them. Then the king decides to give him the flesh,

over the whole there is practi pranks of the ster, and also belo by the religio
199. The work is an example of a play composed and performed for the
propagation of the Jaina religion in the manner of the Moharājaparājaya
(para 32), the Prabudhharauhiņeya (para 38) and the Dharmābhyudaya
(para 196). Consequently, greater part of it is occupied by the religious
discussions between the king and his minister, and also between the king and
the hawk. Sometimes the pranks of the Vidūşaka bring a lively touch, but
on the whole there is practically very little action, and the verses predominate
over the dialogues, so much so that we find not less than 137 stanzas in this
short play. Some of the verses are quite noteworthy. When the Vidūsaka
raises doubts regarding the existence of another world the king makes him
silent with the following illustration-
करस्थमप्येवममी कृषीवलाः क्षिपन्ति बीजं पृथुपङ्कसङ्कटे।
वयस्य केनापि कथं विलोकितः समस्ति नास्तीत्यथवा फलोदय:।।

And description of the shining sabre in the king's hand-

Finally, when the gods praise the greatness of Vajrāyudha, he express-
es his modesty in very simple but eloquent words:

The Hammīramadamardana of Jayasimhasūri
200 The Hammīramadamardana of Jayasimhasūri is especially notewor-
thy, because it is a drama on a contemporary historical event. Of historical
dramas we have very little in Sanskrit literature in comparision with the
plays based on mythology. Two plays of Višākhadatta-the Mudrārāksasa
and the Devicandragupta, the latter being known only through the quotations
in the Nātyadarpaya of Rāmacandra and the Srmgāraprakāśa of Bhoja-are
famous. We know of the Lalitavigrarāja Nātaka composed by Somadeva
(circa 1153 A. D.), in honour of king Vīsaladeva or Vigraharāja of
Sākambhari, and also of the Pratāparudrakalyāņa (circa 1300 A. D.)
of Vidyānātha, inserted in his treatise on rhetoric, the Pratāparudraya-
sobhūsaņa, as an illustration of the drama, which celebrates his patron,
and of the Pārijātamañjarī (1231 A. D.) of Madana. We have already
mentioned in the first chapter several historical plays composed and
performed in Gujarāt-viz. the Karnasundarī of Bihlaņa, the Mudri-
takumudacandra Prakarana of Yasascandra, the Moharājaparājaya of
Yasahpāla, the Candralekhāvijaya Prakarana of Devacandra, and the Gamgā-
dāsapratāpavilāsa of Gamgādhara. Several of these plays make use of
mythological motifs and they are historical only in a limited sense. The

Hammīramadamardana takes for its theme a purely historical incident
viz. the repulse of the Muslim attack by Vastupāla and Vīradhavala, and
has treated of it in a manner which reveals that the author had almost
first-hand information of the contemporary events. The word Hammira
is a corrupt form of the Arabic word Amīra meaning "a noble,' which seems
to have been used here to denote the Sultan of Delhi, who has been some.
times called by the name Milachrikāra in the drama.
201. The Hammīramadamardana is a five-act play. The author claims
(p. I) that it includes all the nine sentiments, in contrast to some Prakaranas
exploiting the sentiment of fear, with which the audience has been surfeited,
In act I after the prologue, enter Viradhavala and Tejapāla, the subject
of their talk being the extraordinary merits of Vastupāla as a statesman.
We also know that Turuska Hammīra and Yādava Simhana seek an
opportunity of attacking Gujarāt, and that they may hope for aid from Samgrā-
masimha, nephew of Simha, the lord of Lāța. The spies of Lāyaṇyasimha,
Tejapāla's son, supply important information and king Vīradhavala expresses
desire to attack Hammira. But Vastupāla warns him against rashness
in pursuing the enemies too far and advises him to take the aid of the
Mārvāà princes. In act II we find that the advice has been followed,
as related by Lāvanyasimha. Then a spy Nipuụaka enters with the tale
of his adventures; he entered Simhana's camp, passed himself off as a spy
on Vīradhavala's movements, reported that the king was ready for an
attack on Hammīra, and persuaded Simhaņa to wait in the forest of the
river Tapti for a favourable opportunity to attack Vīradhavala after his
forces have been weakened by battle with Hammīra. Through the
machinations of his brother Suvega, who was also a spy in the service of
king Devapāla of Mālvā, Nipuņaka succeeds in creating an impression on
Simhaņa that Samgrāmasimha was in the opposite camp, and in frightening
the latter into flight. Vastupāla comes on the stage. His spy Kušalaka
informs him that Samgrāmasimha is preparing for an attack on Stambhatirtha
Vastupāla takes precautions for its defence, and summons Bhuvanapāla.
Samgrāmasimha's minister, with whom he arrives at an understanding,
assuring Vīradhavala of that Prince's aid. In act III, a spy Kamalaka
informs about the fate of Jayatala, the king of Mevāạ. Terrified by the
attack of the Mlechhas, some people in despair flung themselves into wells
burned themselves in their houses or hanged themselves, until he depresse
the foe and heartened the people by announcing the approach of Vīradhavala
at whose name the Turuskas fled in terror. What Vastupāla is doing fo:
success against the Mlechhas after he had disposed off other foes has beer
shown by a conversation between two spies, Kuvalayaka and Sighraka
which forms the Pravesaka to act IV; Vastupāla has induced the Caliph
of Baghdād by a false report to instruct Kharpara Khān to send Milachrīkār:
to him in chains, and he has won over several Gurjara princes by promising
them the lands of the Turuskas when they are defeated. Then ente

pressed hard by Kharpara Khān as well as Viradhavala. Milchrīkāra does not
desire to retreat, but he and his minister fly hastily when they hear the sound
of approach of Viradhavala's army. Vīradhavala is disappointed at not being
able to capture his foes, but obeys Vastupāla's counsel against rash pursuit,
Act V is very interesting, as it describes the return of the triumphant king and
the minister Tejapāla to Dhavalakka from the scene of action. Vīradhavala
has been depicted as mounted over a Naravimāna, which presumably means
an aerial car in the form of a man. After passing over Mount Abu, the
seat of the God Acaleśvara, the Vasişthāśrama and the sages living there,
they come to Candravatī, the capital of the Paramāra kings. Then they
approach the town of Sidhhapura, where the sacred Sarasvati flows eastwards
(777 RIT: FACETIRIZ aratJEFELHË 19:19A AT, P. 47), and see the temple of
the Bhadramahākāla, by which is meant the famous shrine Rudramahālaya
built by Mūlarāja. Then they see Anahilavād, the capital of Gujarāt, and
are highly delighted at the sight of the great lake Sahasralimga. Going
southwards, they see Karşāvati ( same as Asãpallī on the site of modern
Ahmedabad) on the bank of the river Sābhramatī, held by Lavanaprasāda,
and finally reach Dhavalakka, where the queen Jayataladevi was eagerly
waiting for the king. The places are described in a highly rhetorical style,
and the idea of the aerial travel from Ābu to Dhavalakka seems to have
occurred to the poet's mind by the descriptions of such travels from Lamkā to
Ayodhyā in the numerous Rāma-dramas and also in the Raghuvamsa (vide
para 190 ). After the return of all to Dhavalakka, we know that Vastupāla
has intercepted at sea Radi and Kadi, Milchrīkāra's preceptors, returning
from Baghdad, and that Milchrīkāra has been forced to enter into a friendly
alliance in order to secure their safety. Vastupāla and Vīradhavala congra-
tulate one another. Finally, the king enters Siva's temple, where the god
presents himself before him and grants him a boon.?
202. Though the Hammiramadamardana is primarily meant to eulogize
the greatness of Vastupāla and Tejapāla, and also of king Vīradhavala, natura-
lly it throws some important light on contemporary history. We also come
to know how the system of spies worked in those days. Being a production
of the later mediaeval Sanskrit literature, it is written in a highly ornate and,
artificial style; however, the dialogues are forceful, and the poetry is charming
and abounds in choice similes. The characters of Vastupāla, Tejapāla and
Vīradhavala are well-marked and full of life and the depiction of the aerial
travel suggests that the poet is intent upon doing something imaginative,
There is only one female character in the play, viz. queen Jayataladevī, and
it seems that the poet has introduced her to delineate the erotic sentiment in
the beginning of the fifth act. If we consider her to be the heroine, naturally
We should take Viradhavala as hero, in whose mouth the Bharatavākya is
also put. On the other hand, Vastupāla is the main character in the play,
and his figure looms large over all the events. Probably, the poet has
intended him as the counsellor and the guide-rather a Guru in the political

sense-of Viradhavala. His role may be compared with that of Cāņaky
in the Mudrārākşasa, in which Candragupta is the hero, but the mai
burden of action falls on his Guru.
203. The play abounds in lyric verses, though there is no such grea
disparity between the extent of the prose and verse, as we find, for example
in the Dūtāmgada or the Karupāvajrāyudha. There is a remarkabl
fancy in the following description of the evening:
नीलानि पट्पदकुलानि हसन्मुखीनां लीनानि भान्ति हृदयेषु कुमुदतीनाम् ।
दूराभ्युपेतनि नकान्तकरान्तसमयीयूषशान्तविरहानलसंनिभानि ।।

And the chamberlain gives a poetic account of his old age in the
following verse-

NARACANDRA'S GLOSS ON THE ANARGHARĀGHAVA
204. It will be convenient here to treat of Naracandra's Tippana on
the Anargharāghava Nāțaka of Murāri, as its subject pertains to drama.
As we have already seen, Devaprabha, Naracandra's guru, had composed
a commentary on the same play, but we would not study here the works
of Devaprabha, because though he was a senior contemporary of Vastupāla,
he cannot be considered one of his literary circle, in the sense in which
Naracandra can be. We have no evidence whatsoever to suggest that
1 Vide p. 73, footnote 3.

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMĀTYA VASTUPĀLA
Anarghataracandra's er meaning of that no occa
the literary activity of Deraprabha was patronized by Vastupāla or by any
of his family-members. The work of Devaprabha as well as that of Nara-
candra are unprinted and available in manuscript form. The commentary of
Deraprabha is a detailed and elaborate work, its Granthāgra being 7100 blokas,
while the work of Naracandra is a lippana or gloss, its Granthāgra being 2450
slokas,a i. e., only about one third of the work of his Guru. Thus
Naracandra has not aimed at writing a full-fledged commentary on the
Anargharāghava, the reason may be that his Guru had already composed
one. Naracandra's work being like modern Notes' is concerned only with
the elucidation of the meaning of the text, and the text not being a scientific
work like the Nyāyakandalī, he had no occasion to propound any independent
views, as he had in his Tippana on the Nyāyakandalī (vide ch. XVII).
It appears that in the Tippaņa on the Anargharāghava, the author desired
to supply a handy guide to the students, as the play of Murāri attracted a
large number of students in mediaeval Gujarāt. In this work, Naracandra
has never cited an authority or discussed a figure of speech, and seldom
has he given any quotations. He has not discussed the technicalities of
Sanskrit: drama nor has he dwelt upon the explanations of the technical
terms. Though Naracandra was a great scholar, he has produced this
work in a very simple form, which would be useful to the beginners in
literary studies. Perhaps, that is the reason why the number of the extant
manuscripts of Naracandra's work is much larger than of the manuscripts
of the commentaries of Devaprabha and Jinaharsa, which would show
that Naracandra's gloss had proved to be useful and popular among
the students.

CHAPTER VIII
PRAS'ASTIS
The literary form of Pras'asti and its development
205. Prasasti or panegyric is one of the most interesting forms of
Sanskrit literature, because though written in ornate Kārya style, the
Praśastis deal with historical personages and contain much that is helpfu
for the reconstruction of the past history. In the earliest Indian literature
there is frequent mention in the Brāhmanas and the Upanişads of the
"Gāthā Nārāśamsī" or "songs in praise of men.” These songs are connectec
with the Dānastutis of the Rigveda and the Kuntāpa hymns of thi
Atharvaveda, and are in a way precursors of the heroic episodes in the
epics, for their contents are glorious deeds of the warriors and princes
and the scholars believe that these Gathās developed into epic poems o
considerable length, centring around one hero or one great event.?
206. Later on, we find the Prasastis in the form of inscriptions, the
notable examples of which we find in the Gupta age. Harişena's Praśast
of Samudragupta, inscribed on the Allahabad pillar ( 375–390 A. D.)
Girnār inscription of Skandagupta ( 456 A. D.) and Vatsabhatti's Prasast
of the sun-temple at Mandasar (Mālava Samvat 529, which accordin
to Bühler is equivalent to 473-4 A. D. ) deserve special mention. Thes
and several others are the specimens of the court-poetry zealously cultivate
under the patronage of kings or sometimes of ministers, as in the case
Vastupāla. Even after the days of Hindu suzerainty were over thi
tradition of composing a Prasasti especially to commemorate the buildin
of monuments continued upto most recent times. In Gujarāt and Rājasthāi
especially among the Jainas, there is a characteristic form of the Prasast
viz. the Grantha-prasasti or "panegyric at the end of the book," Th
Jaina authors generally gave long Praśastis at the end of their composition:
supplying detailed account of themselves, their Gurus and their gachha
Moreover, the Prasastis of those lay followers under whose auspices th
books were copied down and also of those who bought religious books ani
donated them to deserving monks and nuns for attaining merit have als
been given at the end of manuscripts. A large number of such Prasasti
have been published in the reports of scholars like Peterson and Bhandarka,
and also in the descriptive catalogues of the Jaina Bhāndārs at Pātan anı
Jesalmer, and in collections like the Jaina Pustaka Prasasti Samgraha
Such Prasastis yield a wealth of information on the history of a large numbe
of aristocratic and upper middle-class Jaina families of mediaeval Gujarat.
207. A typical Prasasti is simple in structure. After a benediction
it proceeds to describe the donor or the builder of the monument. Whe
the donor or the builder is not identical with the reigning prince, the Praśast
Cadds something about the latter. In both the cases it gives som

genealogical information. Then it describes the donation and enumerates
the privileges or conditions accompanying it, or describes in Kāvya style
the structure built by the patron. It also sets out generally the name of
the architect who constructed it, the priest who consecrated it, the poet
who composed the Prasasti, the scribe who wrote it on copper or stone,
and the artisan who engraved it. There are slight variations in the form
according as the Praśasti is inscribed on a temple, an image, a public
building, a copper-plate or is appended to a manuscript. The historically
interesting part is generally the genealogy and the heroic or pious deeds
mentioned therein. Some Praśastis are very shortmonly of a few lines,
while others extend to more than a hundred lines or verses. Some Praśastis
are written in prose, some in verse, while others in a mixture of prose
and verse; and their value as history and poetry varies within a wide range.
Pras'astis commemorating good deeds of Vastupāla and Tejapāla
208. Vastupāla and Tejapāla have to their credit a large number of
inscriptions_both long and short-but we shall take into consideration only
those which deserve to be called independent Kāvyas. We shall also
review such poems which though not inscribed anywhere were composed
as panegyrics and as such deserve to be reviewed here. All these poems
have Vastupāla and Tejapāla as their central figures, except one Prasasti,
viz. the Vaidyanāthaprasasti of Darbhāvati, extolling the Vaidyanātha temple
and its renovator king Vīsaladeva, composed by Someśvara, one of
Vastupāla's literary circle. As the central theme of most of the Praśastis
is Vastupāla and his good deeds and as almost all of them indulge in
unqualified praise according to the traditional style, they are not more
than mediocre in literary merit. However, they have remarkable flashes
of poetry in certain places.
The Ābu Pras'asti of Somes'vara
209. The Abu Prasasti of Someśvara is intended to commemorate
the building of the temples on Abu, and contains 74 verses in different
metres. First two verses praise the goddess Sarasvati and Neminātha,
the cheif diety in the Ābu temple, and the third verse contains a short
description of Anahilavād. Then follow a genealogy of the builders and
admiring references to their parents, brothers and sisters (vv. 4-24). In
verses 25–29 the poet mentions Arņorāja, who was 'an ornament of a
clan of the Caulukyas' (viz. Vāghelās), and his son and grandson
Lavaņaprasāda and Viradhavala. Then we find a description of Abu
and a genealogy of the Paramār kings ruling there, beginning from their
mythical origin from the sacrificial altar of Vasiştha upto Somasimha,
the then ruler, and his heir-apparent KȚsyarāja (vv. 30–42). Again,
there begins an eulogy of Vastupāla and his family-members his wife
Lalitādevi and son Jayantasimha, Tejapāla and his wife Anupamā, and
also elder brother Malladeva and his wife and son (vv. 43-58). Then
the poet refers to the building of the temple by Tejapāla and installation
of the statues of ten of his family-members on elephants, looking like-ten

129
Dikpālas coming to salute the Jina (vv. 59-65). Verses 66-68 eulogize
in hyperbolic terms the good deeds of Vastupāla, and 69-71 mention the
Ācāryas of the Nāgendra gachha, from among whom Vijayasenasūri had
performed the installation-ceremony of the temple. Verse 72 bestows
benediction on the temple and its builder, and in 73 Some vara mentions
himself as the author. And the last verse invokes the favour of Neminātha
and goddess Ambikā on this panegyric of Vastupāla's family, and two
sentences in simple prose mention the name of the engrayer and the date
of installation.
Prose-portion in the Girnār inscriptions
210. Among the Girnār inscriptions of Vastupāla, there are six long
inscriptions which deserve the status of independent Praśastis. The
prose-portion in all the six inscriptions occurs in the beginning, and being
almost literally identical in all of them, presumably is the composition
of one author, whose name, unfortunately, is not known. It is noteworthy
that the prose-portion contains some useful information and important
dates regarding the history of Vastupāla's family, and as such, is useful
for the history of Gujarāt of the mediaeval Hindu period.
Somes'vara's verses in the Girnār inscriptions
211. In the Girnār inscriptions, after the aforesaid prose-portion, there
occur a few verses by way of the panegyric of the builder-verses which
are expressly mentioned as the composition of individual poets. Out of six
inscriptions, verse's in two (HIG no. 207 and PJLS no. 38–1; HIG no.
209 and PJLS no. 40–3) are from the pen of Someśvara. The first inscription
has 9, while the second has 16 of Someśvara's verses. All the verses contain
nothing more than conventional panegyric. Though the literary merit of the
Praśastis is bound to be mediocre by reason of the very condition in which
they are composed, Someśvara succeeds in giving some good poetic touches
Speaking of the poetic achievements and administrative efficiency of Vastupāla
he says-
विरचयति वस्तुपालश्नुलुक्यसचिवेषु कविषु च प्रवरः। न कदाचिदर्थहरणं श्रीकरणे काव्यकरणे वा ।।
About Tejapāla he says-
तेज पालः सकलप्रजोपजीव्यस्य वस्तुपालस्य । सविधे विभाति सफलः सरोवरस्येव सहकारः॥'
And he describes how the fame of Vastupāla has spread everywhere
उदारः शूरो वा रुचिरवचनो वाऽस्ति न हि वा भवतुल्यः कोऽपि क्वचिदिति चुलुक्येन्द्रसचिव ।
समुद्भूतभ्रान्तिर्नियतमवगन्तुं तव यशस्ततिर्गहे गेहे पुरि पुरि च याता दिशि दिशि ॥
The Vaidyanātha Pras'asti of Somes'vara
212. Someśvara has got to his credit another very important Prasasti
of historical value, viz. the Vaidyanāthaprasasti of Darbhāvatī, even if we
do not consider his lost Prasasti of the Viranārāyanaprāsāda, built by king

Viradhavala at Dhavalakka (para 73). The Vaidyanāthaprasasti was intended
to commemorate the reparation by King Visaladeva of the temple of
Vaidyanātha Vahadleva or Siva in the form of divine physician. The
Prasasti is a long poem of 116 verses and bears the date of V. S. 1311
( 1255 A. D.), when both Vastupāla and Tejapāla were already dead some
years before. Unfortunately, the two slabs bearing the Prasasti are very
badly worn out. The writing on one slab is almost wholly obliterated,
and no line on the other is now left entire, and consequently we can hardly
make out a single verse in its entirety. Still, we can see that the fragments
of verse six are identical with the Kirtikaumudi II. 2, and verse 14 with
the Kirtikaumudi II. 99. Available portions of verse 25 agree with verse
27 of the Ābu Prasasti of Someśvara. Even from the scanty fragments
of the Prasasti, it can be said that the major portion of it extolls the
warlike exploits of kings of Gujarāt and of the Vāghelā chiefs, and
especially of Vīsaladeva. Verse 45 refers to defeat of the lord of Dhārā
and of the ruler of Deccan at the hand of Vīsaladeva. With verse 80 begins
apparently the account of Visaladeva's building operations. We hear of
the erection of one or several temples of Siva (vv. 81 and 91), and of
the restoration of a temple of the Sun, called Mülasthāna" (v. 92), of
another temple which resembled a peak of the mountain of Hara,' i. e.
Kailā sa (v. 93), and that he who in form resembled Cupid renovated the
Prākāra,' i. e. the enclosure, probably of some other temple. Verse 102
says that in his country the sound of the Vedas, chanted by indefatigable
Brāhmins who were gladdened by fees given at great sacrifices, (ever)
meets one's ears. In the concluding portion of the poem (vv. 109 ff.),
Someśvara speaks of the officials and architects connected with the building
of the temple, of himself, of the writer and the engraver of the Prasasti.
The fact that two verses from this Prasasti have been included in the
Sūktimuktāvali of Jahlaņa (para 77) is an eloquent testimony of the poetic
fame which it enjoyed, and if we get a transcript of it from some old
manuscript, as in the case of the Sukſtakīrtikallolinī of Udayaprabha and
the Vastupāla-Tejapālapraśasti of Jayasimhasūri, it will be deemed a notable
literary discovery.
Udayaprabha's verses in a Girnār inscription and his
Sūkytakīrtikallolini
213. Then, coming to the Prasastis composed by Udayaprabhasūris
we may first mention his 9 verses in one of the Girnār inscriptions (HIG
no. 212 and PJLS no. 43–6). But his principal contribution to this
domain of literature is the Sūkņtakīrtikallolini, a long Prasasti of 179
Ferses. As its very name suggests, it is a panegyric of the good deeds
of Vastupāla. After usual salutation to the deities, it describes at considerable
length the valour of the kings of the Cāvaļā dynasty (vv. 9-18), and
devotes not less than fifty verses (vv. 19-69) to the kings of the Caulukya

dynasty. Then follows the praise of Viradhavala and his ancestors (vv.
70-97); a genealogy of Vastupāla and the praises in Kārya style of the
minister and his family-members naturally follow (17. 98-137). Verses
137–140 mention his warlike deeds, and 141-149 refer to his pilgrimages.
After giving a genealogy of the Acāryas of the Nāgendra gachha (vv.
150–157 ) and praising Vijayasenasūri (vv. 158–61 ), the author enumerates
the Dharmasthānaparamparā or the large number of public and religious
buildings of Vastupāla, which he had built in obedience to the instruction
of the Acārya (vv. 162-77). Verse 178 supplies the name of the author
and the last verse gives the conventional blessing. The Prasasti does not
contain any new historical information, which we do not get from other
sources, though its importance is not to be minimized, as it refers to many
facts which might prove very useful as corroborative evidence.
Udayaprabha's Pras'asti of the Upās'raya at Stambhatīrtha and the
Vastupālastuti
214. The Prašasti of an Upāśraya built by Vastupāla at Stambhatīrtha
is a composition of Udayaprabha. It contains 19 verses and a few lines
in prose, and has nothing more than the genealogy and the conventional
praise of the builder and his religious teachers. The Vastupālastuti of
Udayaprabha is a collection of 33 eulogistic verses. The work as a
whole does not seem to have been occasioned by a particular incident or
to be intended to commemorate some good deed, but looks like a systematic
arrangement of the author's laudatory verses in praise of Vastupāla, and
it is quite possible that the individual verses might have been composed
on particular occasions, though nothing definite can be said on that point,
There are some beautiful verses in the Praśastis by Udayaprabha, and I
might quote here a few of them. He praises the speech of Vastupāla in
a very charming manner-
पीयूगादपि पेशला शशधरज्योत्लाकलापादपि स्वच्छा नूतनचूतमञ्जरिभरादप्युल्लसत्सौरभाः।।
वाग्देवीमुखसामसूक्तविशदोद्गारादपि प्राञ्जलाः केषां न प्रथयन्ति चेतसि मुदं श्रीवस्तुपालोक्तयः ।।
And expressing wonder at the contrast between his merciful mind
and warlike deeds, the poet says-
चेतः केतकगर्भपत्रविशदं वाचः सुधाबन्धवः कीर्तिः कार्तिकमासमांसलश शिज्योत्लावदातद्युतिः।
आश्चर्य क्षितिरक्षणक्षणविधौ श्रीवस्तुपालस्य यत् कृष्णत्वं चरितैरपास्तदुरितैलोकेषु भेजे भुजः ।।
Making a charming use of Blesa which is a favourite literary figure
with Sanskrit poets, the poet again praises his patron-
सूरो रणेषु चरणप्रणतेषु सोमो वक्रोऽतिवक्रचरितेषु बुधोऽर्थबोधे।
नीतौ गुरुः कृतिजने कविरक्रियासु मन्दोऽपि च ग्रहमयो न हि वस्तुपालः ॥3
Naracandra's verses in the Girnār inscriptions and his Vastupālapras'asti
215. Naracandrasūri has to his credit the metrical portion in two in-
scriptions on Gimnār (HIG no. 208 and PJLS no. 39-2; HIG no. 211 and

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMÄTTA VASTUPĀLA
PJLS no. 42-5). The first inscription has 7, while the second has 11 laudatory
verses. Naracandrasūri's Vastupālaprašasti is a panegyric in 26 verses. In
the first rerse the poet salutes the first Tirthamkara ķşabhadeva and in the
second verse he mentions Vastupāla, Tejapāla and their ancestors, while the
rest of the poem is devoted to conventional praise of the patron. About the
merits of his patron the poet says-
agar-fez-fareaen-ha-hati-hat:12Fafirari: featshu ant a ante 112
Vastupāla's proficiency in use of arms and his generosity have been
praised in following words-
रणे वितरणे चात्र शस्त्रैर्वस्त्रैश्च वर्षति । अमित्रमित्रयोः सद्यो भिद्यते हृदयावनिः ॥
Narendraprabha's verses in a Girnār inscription and his two
Pras'astis of Vastupāla
216. 13 laudatory verses in a Girnār inscription (HIG no. 210 and PJLS
no. 41-4) are from the pen of Narendraprabhasūri. His longer Vastupāla-
prasasti of 104 verses is of some importance from historical and literary poin-
is of view. After saluting the first Jina and Mahādeva in a punning verse,
the poet extolls the kings of the Caulukya dynasty (vv. 2-12), and then those of
the Vāghelā dynasty (vv. 13-17). Then we are told about the ancestors of Va-
stupāla (vv. 18–24), and also about his personal merits (vv. 25-28). Verse
29 says that Vastupāla fixed his mind on religion, and verses 30–31 mention
his pilgrimages, after which follows a long list of temples, public places, etc.,
built and repaired by him at different places (vv. 32-98). Verses 99–104
refer to the Acāryas of the Nāgendra gachha of which Vastupāla was a foll-
ower, and also to the author himself and his Gurus. Narendraprabha's se-
cond Vastupāla-prasasti in 37 verses is entirely devoted to conventional praise
of the two brothers and of king Vīradhavala, whom they were serving, and
does not refer to any historical event in particular.
The Vastupāla-Tejapāla-Pras'asti of Jayasimhasūri.
217. The Vastupāla-Tejapāla-praśasti of Jayasimhasūri is a panegyric in
77 verses commemorating the installation of golden flag-staffs by Tejapāla on
the Devakulikās or small shrines in the temple of Muni Suyratasyāmin which
was known as the Sakunikāvihāra at Brgukachha. Like a number of Pras-
astis which we have reviewed, this also contains the genealogy of the Caulukya
(vv. 4–32) and the Vāghelā (vv. 33–38) kings, and that of the donor Vastupāla
(vv. 39–51) and also a list of his good deeds (vv.52–62). Verses 63-71 describe
how Jayasimhasūri, head priest of the shrine and the author of this poem,
requested Tejapāla for installation of golden flag-staffs, and how Tejapāla acted
accordingly after obtaining the consent from his elder brother. The rest of the
poem bestows conventional blessings, in high-ilown language, on the golden
staffs, the temple and the two ministers, and in the last yerse the poet mentions
his name,

The Darbhāvatī-Pras'asti
218. Now, we would review a Prasasti, the text of which is lost, and the
author unknown, but the detailed contents of which are available from the
Vastupālacarita of Jinaharşa. While Tejapāla returned from Godraha
(Godhrā) after defeating and capturing Ghughula, the chief of that place (vide
para 52), he built the fort of Darbhāyatī and also constructed some
temples in that city. The Vastupālacarita expressly mentions that Tejapāla
had installed two slabs of a Pras'asti or inscription in the walls of
a Jaina temple built by him there, and concludes the account of the public
works of Tejapāla in that city by the words-h HTATETT, meaning thereby
that these details have been taken from the above-mentiored Prasasti. The
Darbhāvatīpraśasti mentioned by the Vastupālacarita is clearly different from
the Vaidyanāthaprasasti of Someśvara to which we have already referred,
because the contents of the two are altogether different from each other. Though
we are not in a position to reconstruct the text of the original Prasasti, it would
be suitable here to give a translation of the relevant verses of the Vastupāla-
carita-“Accompanied by the tributary chiefs the son of Aśvarāja arrived at
the town of Darbhāvati, which was rich like the capital city of the Vidarbha
country (62). The wise one, finding that the residents of the town were
affected with the pain of the shaft of terror of the rulers of Pallī, forgetting all
other thoughts, constructed round the town ramparts which touched the sky
and were made resplendent by the statues of Mālrāja and other kings. It had
various courses, it afforded shelter to the virtuous, (and was meant) so to say,
for the comfort of the gods moving in the sky without a support. He thus
removed every fear of the helpless travellers, as the Sun removes the mass of
darkness. The birth of such persons is, verily, good for humanity (63-66).
He built there the temple of Jina-lord Pārsva, which was marked with golden
pitchers, was like Kailāsa, the chief of the mountains, and looked brilliant on
account of the line of fluttering banners. It had the Toranas and the statues of
his forefathers, was like collirium of nectar for the eyes of the triple world, and
had one hundred and seventy temples of Jina around it. The image of
Kumāradevī, the mother of the chief minister, riding an elephant and holding a
garland of silver-flowers in the hand, shines in the porch, like the mother of the
first Jina. There he also constructed other famous monuments with a view to
please the heart of the Caulukya king ( 67-70), such as these-in the assembly.
hall of the Vaidyanātha temple in the town of Darbhāvatī, Tejapāla placed
twentyone pitchers of gold (71). He, who was the chief among the victorious,
built a Jaina temple in the front of the adytum of the Vaidyanātha Mahādeva,
in which he put the statues of his master (i. e. king Viradhavala), his beloved
queen, as well as his own image and the images of the younger and elder
members of his family (72). He also put nine sacred gold pitchers in the
Udyotas or sky-lights of the nine partitions, and they looked like illuminators

(73). In the two doors of the western and the northern verandah he placed
two (slabs of the) Prasasti? speaking of his auspicious fame (74). Having
constructed a beautiful step-well full of sweet water, called Svayamvara, he
made the earth full of the relish of the fresh ambrosia (75). In front of the
northern gate of the abode of Vaidyanātha he erected high Torana of
white marble (76). Here his brother (i, e. Vastupāla) built with white
marble a porch for the bull (Vrsa-maņdapikā) in two storeys adorned with
golden Kalasa, in front of the residence of the king (77). He also built at the
confluence of the rivers Revā and Uru in the Kālakṣetra the temple of Vire-
svara which he so named after the name of his king (i. e. Vīradhavala) (78).
At the sacred place called Kumbheśvara he built five abodes of ascetics, with
all the materials for religious performances (79). This is in the Darbhāvatī
Prasasti."
219. The Authenticity of the contents of the Darbhāvatīprasasti supplied
by the Vastupālacarita is corroborated by the fact that the installation of golden
pitchers in the temple of Vaidyanātha has been also mentioned by the Sukrta-
samkīrtana (XI. 344), the Sukštakīrtikallolini (vv. 175-76), and the first
Vastupālaprasasti of Narendraprabhasūri(vy. 48-50). The putting of the statues
of king Viradhavala, his queen and several of the minister's family-members
has been referred to in the two latter works, while all the three are unanimous
in saying that the golden pitchers were put in place of those carried away by
king Subhatavarman of Mālavā, when he attacked Gujarāt. Unfortunately,
we are unable to get the original text of the Darbhāvatíprasasti, and hence the
literary evaluation of the work is not possible.
Grantha-Pras'astis in praise of Vastupāla and his son Jaitrasimha
220. It has been pointed out earlier that Vastupāla had established three
manuscript-libraries at Anahilavād, Stambhatīrtha and Brgukachha, at a heavy
cost of money (para 61). It is an old tradition, especially among the Jainas,
that the persons who established such libraries or who got a large number
of manuscripts copied down for such purposes would have their Praśastis app-
ended at the end of each of the manuscripts (para 206), and we may believe
that the manuscripts in the libraries established by Vastupāla also must have
contained such Prasastis. But unfortunately, there is no trace now-a-days of
those libraries. The Tapā Gachha Bhāndār at Pātap has a palm-leaf manu-
1 The original reads as got roata TEHETSGI I have translated in
this way the word treat which is in the duel, because the closing words
after verse 379 are sa chatteit, which shows that there was only one
Prasasti, and not two. It was customary in old times to inscribe one
Kāvya on two slabs and to put them on two different doors or two sides of
the main door. Even to-day we can see that the two slabs of the
Vaidyanāthaprasasti of Someśvara have been put on two door-sides of the
famous Hirā Bhāgol at Darbhāvatſ. It may be remembered here that
the Prasasti which we know of from the Vastupālacarita was composed
to commemorate & Jaina temple built by Tejapăla in front of the
Vaidyanātha temple.

script (no. 8) of the Jītakalpa-cūrņi-ryākhyā of Śricandra sūri, copied down
in V. S. 1284 (1228 A. D.). The text proper is completed on folio 107, while
the subsequent folio (which bears the figure 108 in a later hand, the original
page-figure having become illegible) has four verses in praise of Vastupāla.
These four verses are respectively numbered from 37 to 40, and not referring to
any historical incident in particular they indulge in hyperbolic praise of the con-
ventional type that is found in some of the Praśastis. It seems that these
four verses are concluding portion of a long Prasasti of 40 verses. Sereral foc
lios, subsequent to folio 107, of the said palm-leaf manuscript are presumably
lost, and they must have contained the verses 1–35 of the Prasasti; some un-
critical reader of the later times, not cognisant of the loss of these verses, may
have written the figure 108 on the last folio, under the impression that no port-
ion of his manuscript is missing. Anyhow, we can assume that the said ma-
nuscript may be a rare remnant of one of the public libraries established by Va-
stupāla, and that the extant verses on the last folio form the part of a longer
Grantha-prasasti, which must have been appended at the end of the manuscri-
pts in those libraries. This inference is supported by the fact that the above-
mentioned four verses are not to be seen in any other available poems pertain-
ing to Vastupāla, and hence we are justified in assuming that they are from
an independent Prasasti-kävya praising him. It may be rightly inferred that
Jaitrasimha, Vastupāla's son, was also instrumental in the copying down of a

STOTRAS
The Stotra in Sanskrit literature
: 221. Stotra or hymn is one of the well-practised forms of Sanskrit litera-
ture, and some of its productions are very remarkable specimens of lyrical
poetry. In fact, of all the types of Sanskrit literature, the hymn is the oldest,
because the earliest religious book of India, viz. the ægveda, is a collection of
hymns. These hymns have for their subject Agni, Indra, Varuņa, Uşas, and
many other deities. In course of time, with the change of religious ideas and
forms of worship, Visyu and his various Avatāras and Siva became the princi-
pal deities; and hymns began to be composed about them. Sakti in her
various forms was also worshipped and hymns were addressed to her. The
epics have a large number of hymns to various gods and goddesses uttered by
different characters, and the Puranas and the Tantras afford many specimens
of hymns, and we also find that collection of a hundred or thousand names of
a god or a goddess become numerous. But the Stotra has established as an
independent variety of lyric poetry, and the great popularity enjoyed by the
Sivamahimnastotra, the Sivāparādhakşamāpanastotra, the Sūryaśataka of
Mayūra, and a number of Stotras-both long and short-ascribed to Samkarācārya
is an eloquent testimony to its value as a poetic form, and upto the most
recent times the literary form of Stotra has been cultivated throughout India.
The Rāmas'ataka of Somes'vara
222. Among the literary works of the men of letters patronized by Vastu-
pāla we find the composition of a number of Stotras also, the most noteworthy
among them being the Rāmaśataka of Someśvara. The Rāmaśataka is unprinted,
and available in manuscript-form. It is a hymn to Rāma in one hundred verses
as its very name suggests, and the metre uniformly used throughout is the
Sragdharā. Verse 101, which is not, really speaking, the part of the hymn proper,
is in the Upajāti metre and mentions the name of the author. The hymn praises
Rāma, and is evidently modelled on the Sūryaśataka of Mayūra and the Caudi-
šataka of Bāņa, which are also hundred-verse hymns in the Sragdharā metre,
and were popular in Sanskrit literature. The praise in the Rāmaśataka follows
the course of biographical events in Rama's life. Verses 1-6 are devoted to
his birth and child-plays and verses 6–8 to his training in various lores. Then
we find protection of Viśvāmitra's sacrifice by Rāma (vv. 9-11 ), the killing
of Tādakā and other demons (vv. 12–15), redemption of Ahalyā (vv. 16–19),
Rāma's coming to Mithilā with Vīs'vāmitra, breaking of Siva's bow and
marriage with Sītā (vv. 20–31 ), going back from Mithilā and meeting Paras'u-
rāma (vv. 32-39), Das'aratha's desire to install Rāma as the king and
Rāma's going to the forest (vv. 40–56), wanderings in the forest, the abduct-
1 The Jinaśataka of Jambu Guru (pablished in the Kāvyamālā, Vol. VII)
also is in 100 Sragdharā verses and appeațs to have continued the
same tradition,

ion of Sītā, and Rāma's meeting with the monkeys (vv. 57-71), Hanumān's
meeting with Sítā, building of the bridge on the ocean and the attack on
Lamkā (vv. 72-81), battle of Rāma and Rāvaya and the killing of the latter
(vv. 82-85), Sītā's purification in fire, Rāma's coming to Ayodhyā, and corona-
tion in the end (vv. 96-100).
223. Again, in this Stotra we find Somesvara as a poet of high calibre.
As pointed out earlier, though his Rāmas'ataka has been modelled on the Sūry-
aśataka and the Candisataka, it is nowhere a verbal imitation of these older
poems; we can only say that the poet was inspired by the popularity of these
works. The Rāmaśataka is entirely free from the artificiality of some of the
latter hymns-on the contrary, it has the quality of Prasād or perspicuity, like his
Mahākāvya, Kirtikaumudi. It has that heart-felt fervour and devotion required in
this type of lyrical poetry. These one hundred chiselled verses in Sragdharā
also speak for the author's mastery over the longer metres. And this one
hymn is enough to reserve a place of honour in the Stotra-literature for its
author, Someśvara. I may quote here a few specimens from his poem. The
poet praising Rāma refers to his childhood-
पर्य के पङ्कजन्मानितलविचलत्पाणिपादप्रवाल:
खेलन् बालः प्रमोदं प्रथयतु मिथिलानाथपुत्रीपतिर्वः ।
पित्रोः पोतप्रतीतिः समभवदुचिता पुंसि यस्मिन् पुराणे
पारं संसारवार्द्धन हि परमपरस्तं विना नेतुमीशः ।।
(v. 2)
The poet describes in a charming verse as to how different persons
looked at Rama
पुण्यानां प्राक्तनानां फलमिति जनकनान्तरात्मेति मात्रा
साक्षादक्षीयमाणप्रणयनिधिरिति भ्रातृभिश्च त्रिभिर्यः ।
नीतिमूर्तीत्यमात्यैः परपुरुष इति शानिभिः शायमानः
प्राप प्रौढिं क्रमेण दृढयतु नितरां राघवः सः श्रियं वः ।।
(v.6)
How the vernal beauty welcomed Rāma when he entered the forest
सन्दोहे पादपानां विकिरति कुसुमस्तोममुच्चैः पिकानां
गीते नृत्यं श्रितासु व्रततिषु मरुता कीचकेषु ध्वनत्सु ।
संगीतं काननेन प्रथितमिव मुदा यत्र नाथे त्रयाणां
लोकानामभ्युपेते स भवदवभयात् पातु पीतांबरो वः॥
(v.55)
Look to the Māyā of Râma: Rāvana attained salvation, because he was
killed by Rāma, but while living he experienced the pains of hell, as he saw
the relatives dying before his own eyes:
तस्माद् वः सर्वसिद्धिर्मवतु भगवतो भूरिमायाप्रपञ्चः
पञ्चत्वं प्राप्य यस्मादगमदमरतां राक्षसः सोऽपि सम्यक् ।
किन्तु श्रीकान्तकान्ताहठहरणमहापातकात्तेन काम-
व्यामोहान्धेन बन्धुक्षयनिरयरुजः सेहिरे जीवतेव ।।
(7.92)

138 LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMÁTYÁ VASTUPÅLA
The Stotra in Jaina literature
224. Since very old times the Jainas also have vied with the poets of other
sects in the sphere of religious lyrical poetry, as in almost all the literary forms.
The Jaina literature can show a large number of Stotras in praise of various
Tīrthamkaras and other deities as well as some philosophical Stotras, both in
Sanskrit and Prākrit. Some of them are written for purposes of the cult,
while several others are worthy of being appreciated as lyrical poems too, the
earliest known hymn being the Uvasaggahara-stotra, a hymn to Pārs'vanātha
in 5 stanzas, ascribed to Bhadrabāhu, who is believed by some scholars to
have lived in the second century after Mahāvīra's death. According to Muni
Sri Punyavijayajī, this Bhadrabāhu is identical with Bhadrabāhu, the author of
the Niryuktis on several Jaina Sūtras, but different from his name-sake who is
the author of the Cheda Sūtras, and that helived in the first half the of 6th century
A. D. (vide Mahāvīra Jaina Vidyālaya Rajat Mahotsaya Granth, pp. 185–201).
Among other old and well-known Stotras of the Jainas, the Bhaktāmara-stotra
of Mānatumga and the Kalyāṇamandira-stotra of Sidhhasena Divākara3 and
the Svayambhū-stotra of Samantabhadrat deserve mention. After that,
right upto the 19th century we find numerous Stotras composed by the Jaina
ascetics including the great Hemacandra as well as by lay adherents, in
Sanskrit, Prākrit and Apabhramsa as well as in old Gujarātī and several other
regional dialects, and a few collections of such stotras like the Kāvyamālā,
Vol. VII, the Jaina Stotra Sandoha and the Jaina Stotra Samuccaya have
already been published.
The Stotras by Vastupāla
225. Among the Stotras composed by the lay adherents those by Vastu.
pāla are remarkable not only because they are from the pen of a notable histo-
rical personality, but also because they are not devoid of literary merits of
the religious lyrics. Vastupāla has four Stotras to his credit. (i) The
Adinātha Stotra is a hymn to the first Tīrthamkara in 12 verses. The hymn
is called HatType, because in it the author expresses his ardent longings in reli-
gious and philosophical matters. In the last verse the author mentións him-
self as the recamaraq: or minister of the Gurjar sovereign. (ii) The
Nemistava is a hymn to Neminātha in 10 verses, the hymn proper being an
Astaka containing eight verses, because in the last two verses the author
introduces himself. Here (v. 9) the poet calls himself real or a spiri-
1 Winternitz, A History of Indian Literature, Vol. II, p. 431. The Sūtra-
kṛtānga Sūtra contains a chapter called atrie (Skt. aita) which is, really
speaking, a hymn to Mabāvīra.
12 Acoording to some lists of teachers, Mānatunga lived as early as the
beginning of the 3rd century A. D. Other traditions point to the 5th,
7th, 8th or 9th century as his period (Ibid, p. 549).
3 Some have put Sidhhasena Divakara in the earlier centuries of the
Christian era, while others believe that he flourished as late as the 7th
century A. D. (Ibid, p. 477).
4 Samantabhadra is not later than the 7th centry A. D. For his time, vide
Mahendrakumar Shastri, Prameyakamalamārtanda, intro., pp. 30–32.

2and there it inakos'a (v. 337), and in the Praband heality of Dhar:
tual son of Sarasvati. (iii) The Ambikā Stotra is a hymn in 10 verses to
Ambikā who is the Sāsana-devatā of Neminātha and also the Kuladeyatā of
the Prāgvāta community to which Vastupāla belonged. This is also an Astaka,
because in the 9th verse, there is a prayer for blessings to the devotee and
the roth verse mentions the author. Here Ambikā is described as 'the blessed
one, born on the Himālayas' and 'Haimavati. (v. I), 'Kuşmāņdi,' (vv. 2, 3,
and 4), 'honoured by Purusottama' (v. 6)and also as 'Sarasvati' (v.9), which
shows how the Jaina and Brāhmanical elements were inextricably mixed in
the later Jaina patheon. (iv) The Arādhanā is a simple devotional lyric in 10
verses, speaking about the emptiness of worldly existence and reality of Dbar-
ma. Its first verse ( 7 H Ariano) is found in the Prabandhacintămani (.
234), and the Prabandhakos'a (v. 337), and the Purātanaprabandhasamgraha
(v. 202), and there it is put in Vastupāla's mouth when he was in his last
days (vide para 63 ). Praband has are probably right in doing so, because in the
last verse the author expresses his resolve to abandon food and thus desires
to attain death by fasting like a pious Jaina.
226. If the Naranārāyaṇānanda shows Vastupāla as a remarkable poet
who attempted the form of the Mahākāvya, in these hymns we see him as a
good lyric poet. The hymns are full of devotional fervour and at the same
time reveal the author's command over literary style. A few examples will
be sufficient to prove this. In what an ardent manner the author expresses
his longing in the Adinātha Stotra-
संसारव्यवहारतो रतिमऽतिव्यावर्त्य कर्त्तव्यतावार्तामप्यपहाय चिन्मयतया त्रैलोक्यमालोकयन् ।
श्रीशत्रुञ्जयशैलगह्वरगुहामध्ये निबद्धस्थितिः श्रीनाभेय कदा लभेय गलितज्ञेयाभिमानं मनः॥
(v. 5)
आस्यं कस्य न वीक्षितं ? क न कृता सेवा न के वा स्तुताः ? तृष्णापूरपराहतेन विहिता केषां च नाभ्यर्थना।
तत् त्रातर विमलादिनन्दनवनीकल्पैककल्पद्रुम त्वामासाद्य कदा कदर्थनमिदं भूयोऽपि नाहं सहे?॥
(v.9)
And his lofty praise of Neminātha also deserves notice
जयत्यसमसंयमः शमितमन्मथप्राभवो भवोदधिमहातरि९रितदावपाथोधरः।
तपस्तपनपूर्वदिक्कलुषकर्मवल्लीगजः समुद्रविजयाङ्गजस्त्रिभुवनैकचूडामणिः॥
(v. I)
The Sarva-Jina-Sádhāraṇa Stavana of Naracandra
227. The Sarva-Jina-Sádhāraṇa Stavana of Naracandra is a hymn in 11
verses of Mālinī metre. As the very name of the poem suggests, it is not
addressed to any particular Jina, but it is a hymn in general terms, such as
would apply to all the Jinas. The hymn hardly possesses any noteworthy
feature, except that every foot of each stanza begins with a charming
alliteration, e. g.
हरसि हरसिताभिः सूत्रितज्ञानलक्ष्म्या नयन नयनमाभिस्त्रातरशानपङ्कम् ।
तमसि तमसितिना लोकमाक्रान्तमिन्दुः करनिकरनिपातैः किं न शुभ्रीकरोति ॥
(v.7)
1 The verse is also found in the PK (v. 291) and the PPS (v. 172). It is
noteworthy that in both these works the verse bas been correctly ascribed
to Vastupāla.

CHAPTER X
ANTHOLOGIES
armález Parded by wted, and
Two types of Sanskrit anthologies
228. Anthologies are compilations of verses on several topics. They may
be the composition of one author, like the Subhāşitaratnasandoha (994 A. D.)
of Amitagati or a selection from earlier authors, like the Kavīndravacana samuc-
caya (end of the roth century A. D.) and like several other well-known antho-
logies compiled thereafter. In the anthologies of the latter class, sometimes the
names of the poets are given with the individual verses, and as such they are
important for the history of literature, though in the majority of cases we
have no evidence to determine the dates of the poets. But in this chapter
we have to deal with the anthologies of the former class, viz, those from the
pen of a single author. They are the Karņāmộtaprapā of Somes'vara and the
Viyekapādapa and the Vivekakalikā of Narendraprabhasūri,
The Karnämrtaprapā of Somes'vara
229. The Karyāmrtaprapā is a collection of religious, devotional and
didactic Muktakas composed by the author, and contains 217 verses in diffe-
rent metres. The work is unprinted, and available only in manuscript-form.
Some of its verses can be traced, as will be seen in the next paragraph, to
some of Somes'vara's other works, while others cannot be so traced. They
may have been from some other lost works of the author of which these
might have formed a part, or more probably, they may have been new composi-
tions for this particular purpose. In the colophon, the work has been designated
as a Subhasitāvali or collection of Subhāşitas." That the aim of the author is
mainly religious and didactic is clear from the Mañgalācaraụa, which extends
to first nine verses. The author salutes to Krsya and Siva to make an end
of his Karmas, then salutes the sacred Ganges and pays homage to the three
Vedas residing in his own mouth (v. 5), and in verse 7 he says that the aim
of his work is 'good instruction' (Sadhubodha). The work is divided into 14
different sections, each devoted to a single theme, like Lakşmi or wealth
(V. 10-19), desire (vv. 20–25), anger (v. 26), greed (v. 27), form of the
Kali (vv. 28–39), censure of bad kings (vv. 40-56), the bad people
(vv. 57-65), the learned men (vv. 66-70), fate (vv. 71-79), indifference to
worldly objects (vv. 80–109); in addition, there are miscellaneous poems
(V. 110-45) which contain a number of Anyoktis, verses on quietism (vv.
146-62), didactic verses (VV. 163–96), and lastly, prayer to Kršņa (vv. 196-216),
which contains some verses in praise of Siva also. The last verse refers to the
poet.
230. Verse 109 of the Karņāmặtaprapă describing the sorry plight of
Awahilayād, capital of the Gurjar land (guga efosafat Hausto ) can be
traced to the Kirtikaumudi (II. 104). Verse 108 (Page:get of Tib)
1 इति श्रीठकुरसोमेश्वरविरचिता कर्णामृतप्रपा सुभाषितावली संपूर्णा ॥

Page 190****************************************************************************************
CHAPTER X- ANTHOLOGIES
141
also dilates upon the same topic, but is not to be found in any of the author's
known works. Among the Anyoktis, the verse 124 (मासान् मांसलपाटलापरिमल०)
is to be found in the Prabandhakos'a (v. 329 ) and the Vividhatīrthakalpa
(p. 80), and in both these works it is correctly ascribed to Somes'vara.
Verses 106 and 107 (तिष्ठत्येव तवान्तिके० and तानेव स्तुमहे महेश०) are in memory of
the departed king Sidhharāja Jayasimha. Verses 177-96 seem to have been
composed under the influence of the Carpatapañjarikā Stotra ascribed to
Samkarācārya, as both metre and style suggest. As for example,
वित्तं तदखिलमपि परिगलितं प्रादुर्भूतं शिरसि च पलितम् ।
तदपि न हृदयं विषयवितृप्तं संसेवितुमभिलष्यति कृष्णम् ॥
इयमपि दशनश्रेणी पतिता सा च समाप्ता जगदधिपतिता ।
तज्जगदाश्रयमाश्रय देवं हृदय विरंस्यसि दुःखादेवम् ।।
सत्पात्रेषु न दत्तं दानं मन्ये तत्तव दौस्थ्यनिदानन् ।
प्रणतः कचिदपि न स गोविन्दस्तदयं प्रहरति कालपुलिन्दः ।।
(५. 177-79)
These may be compared with the following verses of the Carpata-
panijari-
अङ्गं गलितं पलितं मुण्डं दशनविहीनं जातं तुण्डम् ।
वृद्धो याति गृहीत्वा दण्डं तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशापिण्डम् ।। .
(v. 6)
गेयं गीतानामसहस्रं ध्येयं श्रीपतिरूपमजनम् ।
नेयं सज्जनसंगे चित्तं देयं दीनजनाय च वित्तम् ॥
(v. 13)
Though Somes'vara has given these 20 verses as a part of his
anthology, they form an independent didactic-philosophical poem and as such
deserves notice.
231. If the Kirtikaumudi shows Somes vara's success in the Mahākāvya
form, his Karžāmộtaprapā testifies to his being equally an adept in the
composition of the Muktakas. It is noteworthy that the author maintains
almost the same poetic level throughout the work, and most of the verses
from the Karụāmrtaprapă can be cited as excellent examples of gnomic and
didactic poetry. The diction is very simple and forceful, and one feels as if
the author is inspired by a religious motive. I shall quote here a few verses.
In the beginning the author bows to the three Vedas which reside in his mouth,
and which are like a medicine prepared from three bitter roots for persons
like himself, afflicted by ignorance-
विषयरसनिरन्तरानुपानप्रकुपितमोहकफोपगुम्फितात्मा ।
त्रिकटुकगुटिका मिव त्रिवेदी वदनगतामहमन्वहं नमामि ॥
(.5)
At another place he praises the Dhīra or stout-hearted fellow-
कुरुतां विधिविरुद्धं तत्कृतमनुमोदतां च पिशुनजनः । न मनागपि धीरमनाः कुप्यति तसै च नस्मै च ।।
(v.78)
He has a fling at the rich people, generally averse to learning-

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASTUPĀLA
धत्ते व्याकरणं न कोऽपि कवितां कुत्रापि नार्थत्यसौ तक मर्कटवन्न कोऽपि निकटीकर्तु कदापीच्छति।।
वेदादुद्धिजते जनस्तदपरं नैवाल्ममप्यस्ति मे भ्रातल्प पणेन केन तदहं वित्तं धनिभ्यो लभे॥
(v. 98)
The author expresses his heart-felt desire for doing religious meditation
in a lonely place-
नगोपान्ते कान्ते क्वचिदपि निकुळे श्रुतिजपैरुपेन्द्रध्यानैर्वा सकलमपि कालं गमयतः।
हिमाकारं हारि त्रिदशत टिनीवारि पिबतः कदा कन्दैर्वृत्तिर्मम शमरतेरीह भविता ।।
(v. 152)
And he is determined to worship the feet of Dāmodara in any
circumstances
स्वयं श्रीरायातु प्रकृतिचपला यातु यदि वा शिवाः कश्चिद वाचो वदतु यदि वा वक्तु विरसाः।
तथाप्येते भ्रातर्न खलु विलसामो न च वयं विषीदामो दामोदरचरणचर्यासु रसिकाः॥
(v. 159)
He advises ignorant in the following expressive words
चित्तं दमय मा कूचे वृत्तं संस्कुरु मा वपुः । गीतां च शृणु मा गीतं पुरुषं पश्य मा स्त्रियम् ॥
(V. 164)
In the end he prays the divine father to save him--the poet-from
worldly existencer
त्वमसि न तथा तात ध्यातःप्रमादितया मया फलम भिमतं निःशङ्कस्त्वां यथाऽहमिहार्पये।
तदपि करुणात्मानं मत्वा भवन्तमुपाश्रितस्तदवतु जवान्मामेतस्माद् भवाभिभवाद् भवान् ।।
(v. 216)
It hardly requires to be said that certain sections of the anthology
betray influences of the Nītiśataka and the Vairāgyaśataka, though it is
to the author's credit that those influences are not verbal, but only
in the matter of treatment and style. It is but natural that a later poet
like Someśvara should derive inspiration from a great predecessor like
Bhartphari.
The Vivekapādapa and the Vivekakalikā of Narendraprabha
232. The Vivekapădapa and the Vivekakalikā are two collections
of verses on Jaina religious and philosophical topics from the pen of
Narendraprabhasūri. Unfortunately, the only palm-leaf manuscript (no.
52 of the incomplete section, in the Samghavī Pāķā Bhāņdār at Pāțaụ)
in which these two anthologies are found is fragmentary, and hence the
works are available in a fragmentary state. From the figures on the
last folio of the Vivekapādapa we know that the complete work would
contain 421 verses, but only 109 verses are available from the extant
folios. In the same way the Vivekakalikā has 110 verses, but 69 out
of them are to be found in the manuscript. Extant portion of the former
work is uniformly in the Anustup metre, except the two Pras'astis lokas
which are in the Sārdūla and the Vasantatilakā respectively, while the
latter work is composed in a variety of metres. Though the author has
intended both the works as collections of verses on Jaina religious topics,
many of the slokaş aſe in the nature of sayings on general morality, good

conduct and human virtues. Though the writings of Narendraprabha
cannot be compared in literary merit with the Karụāmſtaprapā, his verses
are simple and touching. As for example, he gives a verse on the value of
mercy in human life-
दयादयितया शून्ये मनोलीलागृहे नृणाम् । दानादिदूताहूतोऽपि धर्मोऽयं नावतिष्ठते ॥
(VP, V. 24)
Praising the Guru he says-
दिनं न तपनं विना न शशिनं विना कौमुदी श्रियो न सुकृतं विना न जगती विना विक्रमम् ।
कुलं न तनयान्विना न समतां विना निर्वृतिगुरूंश्च न विना नृणां भवति धर्मतत्त्वश्रुतिः ॥
(VK, V. 12)
The author gives several good verses on speaking truth, out of which
one may be quoted-
विवेकस्य प्राणाः श्रुतरसरहस्यं शुभधियः प्रकारः प्राकारः सुचरितपुर स्योन्नततरः।
गुणानां जीवातुः प्रशमदमसन्तोषनिकषः सुखश्रीपयंको वचनमनलीकं मुकृतिनाम् ॥
(VK, Y.39)
And he pays homage to Jõāna or knowledge, fancying it to be a
divine being-
किं कृत्यं किमकृत्यमेव किमुपादेयं च हेयं च किं देवः कश्च गुरुश्च कः किमथवा तत्वं कुतत्वं च किम् ।
संसारश्च क एव मुक्तिरपि केत्येवं यतः सर्वतो निश्चीयेत विवेकिभिर्भगवते शानाय तस्मै नमः॥

torical anecdote wahandhacintamani on
the Vividha-Tīr-
CHAPTER Xİ
PRABANDHAS
The Prabandha a's a form of literature; Prabandha as material for history
233. The Prabandha is a forin of literature peculiar to Gujarāt and Māl-
vā, and especially cultivated by the Jaina writers. The name Prabandha
is given to a historical anecdote generally written in simple Sanskrit prose,
and sometimes in verse. The Prabandhacintāmaņi of Merutuīga (1305
A. D.), the Prabandhakos'a of Rājas'ekharasūri ( 1349 A. D.), the Vividha-Tīr-
tha-Kalpa of Jinaprabhasūri (completed in 1333 A. D.) and the Bhojapra-
bandha of Ballāla (circa 16th century A. D.) are well-known instances of the
Prabandhas in prose, while the Prabhāvakacarita of Prabhācandra sūri (1277
A. D.) is a collection of Prabandhas in verse. Rājas'ekhara, the author of
the Prabandhakos'a, has tried, in the introductory portion of his book," to
make a distinction between a Caritra and a Prabandha. According to him,
the Caritras are the biographies of the Tīrthamkaras, of the Cakravartins or
sovereigns according to the Jaina mythology, of ancient kings, and also of
the religious pontiffs upto Arya Raksitasūri, who died in the year 557 after
Mahāvīra or in 30 A. D. Accounts of the persons who flourished after Arya
Raksita, monks as well as laymen, have been given the name Prabandha by
Rājasekhara. We cannot say whether Rājas'ekhara has some older authority
for making this distinction or whether it is of his own making. Whatever the
case may be, this type of distinction in nomenclature has not been always
observed in actual compositions, because the works dealing with the life
of persons like Kumārapāla, Vastupāla and Jagaậu who flourished as late as
in the 12th and 13th century have been styled as Caritra, e.g. the Kumārapa-
lacaritra of Jinamaụdana (1335-36 A. D.), the Vastupālacaritra of Jinaharsa
(1441 A. D.) and the Jagaðucaritra of Saryānanda (14th century A. D.).
Though the Prabandhas deal with historical personages, the motives with
which they were written "are to edify the congregations, to convince them
of the magnificence and the might of the Jaina faith and to supply the monks
with the material for their sermons, or when the subject is purely of worldly
interest, to provide the public with pleasant entertainment." Therefore, the
Prabandhas should be treated not as so many real histories or biographies, but
only as material to be critically used for historical purposes.
The Prabandhāvali of Jinabhadra
234. The work with which we are to deal here is the Prabandhávali of
Jinabhadra, which being composed during the life-time of Vastupāla for the
instruction of his son Jaitrasimha (para 117), is the oldest collection of the
Prabandhas discovered as yet. The only available manuscript of this work
contains 40 Prabandhas in prose-most of them dealing with historical persons
and topics pertaining to Gujarāt, Rājasthān and Mälvā, while a few give
stories taken from folklore. It has come down in a form, which cannot be

called complete. There appears to be some interpolations in the text, because
it refers to certain events, which occurred after the death of Vastupāla, and a
Prabandha (viz. the Valabhībhanga-Prabandha) has been literally copied
down from the Prabandhacintāmaụi. Two Prabandhas from the work under
review (viz. the Pãdaliptācārya Prabandha and the Ratnas'rāvaka Prabandba)
have been adapted in the Prabandhakos'a." There we cannot say that these
portions have been copied down and interpolated in the work under review
by some later writer or copyist, because the style of this work is very simple
and rudimentary as intended for some elementary student of Sanskrit, while
that of the Prabandhakos'a is comparatively cultured and elevated, which
shows that the author of the Prabandhakos'a has taken these two chapters
from the Prabandhāvali of Jinabhadra, making some stylistic and linguistic
improvements. It may be said on the whole that the later Prabandhas app-
ear to be indebted to the Prabandhāvali for some of their matter, and that
is why it is included by Jinavijayaji in the Purātanaprabandha samgraha,
which forms a companion-volume to the Prabandhacintāmaņi. It is notewor-
thy that the Prabandhāvali quotes in the Pșthrītāja Prabandha four Apab-
hramba verses, three out of which are traced in a corrupt form to the Prthvītāja
Rāso ascribed to the poet Canda, a friend and contemporary of the last
Hindu sovereign of Delhi. These citations have gone a long way to show that
the published Pșthvīrāja Rāso is not a later work in toto, as some scholars
are inclined to believe, but that the Râso has very old nucleus, which is ear-
lier than at least 1234 A. D., the date of Jinabhadra's work.
235. The Prabandhāvali has got a peculiar literary importance. It is an
example of a type of literary medium in which Sanskrit was, so to say,
vernacularized. It popularized the knowledge of Sanskrit and served as a
stepping-stone to the more advanced study of Sanskrit, at least among the
Vais'ya classes of the Gurjarades'a. Thus the language of the Prabandhāvali
is replete not only with Prākritisms, but also with the words taken from the
regional dialect of the time, so much so that it would be difficult for the
reader who does not know something of Prakrits and of old and modern
Gujaräti to grasp the meaning of certain words and expressions. They are
also found in other Prabandhas and some of the Kathā-works written by the
Jainas of Gujarât, and are generally unknown to other parts of India. It may
be noted in this connection that in ancient and mediaeval India, Sanskrit
was not merely the language of the priestly class and the scholars. It was also
the language of the court and of diplomacy, and it was a spoken language
down to comparatively recent times. In Gujarāt, even after the establish-
ment of Muslim rule the legal documents were written in a colloquial Sans
krit, and they were accepted by the courts for the purpose of registration.*
Sanskrit was even understood by a considerable part of the population which

cholars, was a pound prose. The Sput such books
that the Jaina authried to approach tular-Sanskrit, as the nor-
ith a similmernacular-Semeral publica
did not itself use it. "Of course, the Sanskrit spoken or understood by those
who were no scholars, was a popular and colloquial one, not the highly
artificial language of Kārra verse and prose. The speakers of this colloquial
Sanskrit did not study Pāṇini or Hemacandra, but such books as the
Mugdhāvabodhamauktika. The Svetāmbar authors of Gujarat used this
Colloquial Sanskrit in their stories in order to make them intelligible to their
public."? Not that the Jaina authors were incapable of expressing themselves
in literary Sanskrit, but they tried to approach the general public by the
style which may be described as a type of 'vernacular-Sanskrit,' as pointed
out above, and may be compared with a similar mixed language of the nor-
thern Budhhists, known as the 'Gāthā Sanskrit,' the language of works like the
Lalitaristara and the Mahāvastu. Prof. Zachariae has published a list of
words which exclusively occur in the Kāshmīrian authors, and Prof. Schmidst
has supplemented this list. It would be interesting from literary, linguistic
as well as from the cultural point of view if such a list—which is bound to be
a lengthy one—is prepared from the Jaina writers of Gujarāt. Dr. Hertel in his
edition (pp. 291-95) of the Pañcākhyāna of Pūrụabhadra and Dr. Upādhye
in his introduction (pp. 101-10) to the Brhat Kathākośa of Harişeņa, also a
a Jaina writer from Gujarāt, have given lists of words peculiar to Jaina Sans-
krit occurring in their respective texts; and a large number of these words
can be shown as related etymologically, phonetically and semantically to the
forms prevalent in old and modern Gujarātī. I shall give here a short, but
representative list of such words from the Prabandhāvali (pp. 13, 32;

Prabandha of Padmanābha, composed in 1456 A. D., I. 93). Some words of
Persian and Arabic origin like (p. 36; Persian Duruish a religious man',
and retâ (p. 86; Arabic Ji asjid 'a mosque') are also adapte:here. Some of
the words cited above are also to be found in other ver Indo-Aryan langu-
ages of India, but that does not weaken our main ar_ument, because the
author lived in Gujarāt, and it is but natural that he adapte à certain colloquial
words and expressions from the spoken language with which he was most
familiar.
236. Though the Prabandhūvali of Jinabhadra is written in this type of
Sanskrit prose, it is occasionally sprinkled with a number of verses in Sans.
krit, Prākrit and also in Apabhraniša. The Apabhramša verses are inostly
in the Dūhā metre, and they appear to have been taken by the author from
Tolk-literature. It would be interesting to refer in this connec-
tion to the Apabhramśa verses put in the mouth of Sonaladevi
queen of Khamgūra, the chief of Jirnadūrga (modern Junāgadh),
when he was slain by the forces of Sidhharāja Jayasimha. The
Prabandhāvali quotes 13 such verses (pp. 34-35). Sis out of these are found
with slight variations in the Prabandhacintāmaņi (p. 65 ), which was composed
71 years later, and it has two more which are not available in the Prabandha-
vali. All these verses are still widely current in the folk-lore of Gujarāt and
Saurāstra, though naturally they are found in the modern linguistic grab.
But their prevalence throughout a long period extending over more than seven
hundred years speaks for the popularity of this kind of folk-literature, speci-
mens of which have been preserved in the works like this Prabandhāvali.

CHAPTER XII
A COLLEOTION OF JAINA DHARMAKATHĀS
Dharmakathā-literature of the Jainas
237. Narrating entertaining stories and listening to them are deep-
rooted in human nature, as we find from the folk-lore of all the countries of
the world. The folk-stories have been adapted in literature merely as
charming fiction or have been utilized for various purposes, both secular and
religious. Talking of Indian literature, the lost Bịhatkathā of which Prākrit
and Sanskrit versions are found in the Vasudeva-Hindi (about 5th century
A. D.), and the Kathāsarit-sāgara and the Bșhatkathāmañjari (both composed
in the 11th century A. D.) was a great store-house of secular stories, collected
with the sole purpose of literary entertainment. The Pañcatantra is a famous
story-book in which the folk-tales are utilized for teaching worldly wisdom
and also the elements of politics, while the 'Jātaka and the large number of
stories found in Jaina literature are the instances of Dharmakathā or story
used for religious purposes.
238. Budhhists and the Jainas were great story-tellers, because story
was one of the means by which their religious precepts could be preached in
a popular form. The Jaina canon is traditionally divided into four Anuyogas
or sections, of which one is the Dharmakathānuyoga which deals with
religious stories, and the Jñātādharmakathā has been considered as a repre-
sentative text of that section. The Prākrit and Sanskrit commentaries of the
Jaina canonical works contain not only a mass of ancient traditions and lege-
nds, but also numerous folk-tales and stories, and the versified Caritras of the
Tīrthamkaras and other religious personalities were often used as frame-work
in which all types of stories could be inserted. But apart from all these,
the Jaina authors have to their credit a vast story-literature in Sanskrit,
Prākrit, Apabhramsa and modern Indian languages. “All these works, be
they stories in plain prose or in simple verse or elaborate poems, novels or
epics, are all essentially sermons. They are never intended for mere enter-
tainment, but always serve the purpose of religious instruction and edification."
239. The Jaina literature can show scores of story-works, but a great
majority of them have been composed after the roth century. As we go to
the earlier centuries the number of available works progressively decreases,
and we hardly get ten works in all composed during the first millenium
after Christ. Padalipta's great religious novel, Taramgavati (before the
5th century A. D.) is known only through a shorter version prepared
by Nemicandra about 1000 years later; and other ancient works like
the Malayavatī, the Magadhasenā, the Bandhumati and the Sulocană are
known only through literary references. The Vasudeva-Hiņdi of Samgha-
dāsa is a Jaina version in Prākrit of the lost Bịhatkathā, and presents itself as

a monumental remain of the Jaina Dharmakathā-literature which flourished
after the Agama-period. The Samarāicca-kahā of Haribhadrasūri, the
Kuvalayamālākathā of Udyotanasūri and the Upamitibharaprapaīcakathā of
Sidhharşi are three other old Dharmakathās, to which I have already referred
in the first chapter. The Bșhatkathākośa of Harisena is a collection of
Dharmakathās composed in the roth century A. D. In later times the
Jainas, in addition to composing long and elaborate Kathā-works on the
ancient model, also compiled books of stories," in which the stories are either
inserted within a frame-story, in the manner familiar in Indian narrative
literature or else they are just told one after another.
Kathāratnākara of Naracandrasuri
240. The Kathāratnākara or Kathāratnasāgara of Naracandrasūri with
which we have to deal here is a work belonging to the later category. It is
unprinted and available only in manuscript-form. The Granthāgra of the
work is 2091 s’lokas;' It has been divided into 15 Taramgas or chapters
and each chapter contains a story illustrating the merit attained by adhering
to some principle taught by the Jaina religion. It is possible that the author
may have been inspired, in calling his work Kathāratnākara and dividing it
into Taramgas, by the Kathāsaritsāgara of Somadeva, though there is no simi-
larity between their contents. The whole work has been written in the
Anuştup metre, but the concluding verse of every chapter is in a different
metre. Virtues like chastity, penance, giving donations, humility, non-killing
of living beings, non-stealing, serving the elders, not envying others, repeating
the Nayakāra Mantra for attaining religious merits, etc. have been extolled in
these stories, by showing how the principal characters got the fruit of these
moral and religious practices either in this or in the next birth. The narrative
is dull and monotonous in style, and the work has to give nothing very val-
uable from the view-point of literature. Though it is from the pen of a sch-
olar like Naracandra and composed at Vastupāla's request (para 119) it
seems to have been written with an eye on a purely religious audience, prob-
ably for the daily Vyākhyāna, and the principal aim of the author seems to
impress on the mind of the lay adherents the importance of good conduct
from the point of view of the Jaina religion. It may be noted here that the
Kathāratnākara is a collection of Jaina religious stories composed in comp-
aratively earlier times, as the majority of the Kathākos'as are later than
our author. 3

CHAPTER XIII
APABHRAMŠA RĀSAS
A short history of the Rāsaka or Rāsa
241. Though this book is mainly devoted to Sanskrit literary
contribution of the literary circle of Vastupāla, it would not be inappropriate
here to review two Apabhramsa Rūsas composed by the poets of the
circle, because they are also a part of the great literary activity patronized
by the minister. These two Rāsas are the Revantagiri Rāsu, of Vijayasena-
sūri and the Abu Räsa of Palhapaputra. But before coming to these
poems we shall consider what is to be understood by the literary form
of Rūsa or Rāsu (Skt. Rāsaka) which was very popular in Apabhramsa as
well as in old Gujarātī literature.
242. The Rāsaka was not meant for mere recitation or reading,
but was composed with a view to be sung and danced. This type of
composition which whould be compared to ballet dance, must have been
originally a piece of folk-dance and music. Later on, when a comprehen-
sive survey of the different types of actable literary compositions was
made, they were classified under two main heads- (i) the one included
the compositions which mainly provided for recitation and acting, and
(ii) the other provided for singing and dancing. The Rāsaka from which
the form Rāsa or Rāsu is derived comes under the latter head. The
oldest extant reference to this classification—which includes Dombikā,
Bhūra, Prasthāna, șidgaka, Bhānikā, Rāmākrīda, Hallīsaka and Rāsaka-is
found in the Abhinavabhāratī of Abhinavagupta (circa 1000 A. D.), and
there Rāsaka has been defined as follows-
अनेकनर्तकीयोज्यं चित्रताललयान्वितम् । आचतुष्पष्टियुगलाद्रासकं मसृणोद्धतम् ॥
from which we know that the Rāsaka was a Geya Rūpaka, was full of ..
charming rhythm, in which a number of dancing women took part, in
which a maximum of 64 pairs were allowed to play, and which was at
times soft and excited. Later on, we find that the classification and
definition mentioned above were adopted by Hemacandra in the Kāvyānu-
Sāsana (VIII. 4) and by Vāgbhața II in his Kávyānusāsana (p. 18).
Rāmacandra, the pupil of Hemacandra, in his Nātyadarpaņa (Vol. I, pp.
214-15) and Visvanātha in Sāhityadarpana (Kane's ed., pp. 104-5) have
also given the characteristics of Rāsaka and Nātya-rāsaka. It appears
that in older times, the folk-dances were current in different parts of India,
though we have no definite evidence to say in what particular parts the
particular type of folk-dance prevailed. In this connection we have an
interesting legendary account in the Samgitaratnākara of Sārņgadeva (circa
1200 A. D.), which appears to have preserved some historical traditions.
We find therein that Siva created the Tāņdava type of dance, while Pārvatī
created the Lásya type of dance. Pārvatī taught this dance to Usā,

the daughter of Bāpāsura and wife of Anirudhlia, the grandson of Sri Krana;
and l'isā, in her turn, taught it to the Gopis of Dräravati, and they taught
it to the young women of Saurastra, through wlion it spread throughout
the world. This tradition is corroborated by the prevalence of different
types of folk-dances known as Rāsas, Rāsarlas, Garabās and Girabis prevalent
in Gujarāt and Saurāstra even to-day.
243. From all this it may be surmised that the Rāsaka or Räsa
was a type of folk-dance, compurable to the Rası-Kritā of Kha described
in the Bhāgayata and other Purānas, and also to tlsi Garubā dance peculiar
to Gujarāt (alternatively known as Risa ); it was later on avlarted as a
literary piece to be acted, mostly in Prākrit. That the Riisa is actually
played in public is evident from several literary references. The last verse
of the Revantagiri Rāsu refers to the actual performance of the Rāsi-
रंगिहिं ए. रमइ जो रानु सिरिविजयसेन सूरिनिम्नविउ ए ।
नेमिजिणु तूसइ तानु अंबिक पूरद मणि रली ए ।
"Jina Neminātha will favour those who plar with enthusiasm this
Rāsa composed by Sri Vijaya senasūri, and goddess Ambikā will fulfill
their desires."
The Saptakşetri Rāsu (1271 A. D.) speaks of two types of
Rāsas-viz. Tālārasa and Lakuțārasa. By the former category is
meant that kind of Rāsa-dance in which the timing was given by clapping
of hands, while the latter category which is known in Gujarāt as Dāndia
Rāsa, denotes that in which the timing is given by the short sticks (Lakuta )
held in the hands of the dancers. Laksmanagani, the author of the
Supāsanāhacariya (1143 A. D.), has described the action in the Rāsa-dance
as केवि उत्तालतालाउलं रासयं, and thus he refers to that type of Rāsa. in which
timing was given by clapping of hands.
244. Thus it is clear that the Rāsa as a folk-dance and as adapted
in literature was originally meant to be performed. We get a number
of Rāsas from Gujarāt in Apabhraía or a post-Apabhramsa dialect which
was current in the province, the oldest available specimen of this literary
form being the Bharata Bāhubali Rāsa of Salibhadrasüri (1185 A, D.).
Later on, in Old Gujarāti the Rāsa form became stereotyped and generally
denoted the versified narratives from the Jaina mythology which were
recited in Upāśrayas, and we have to put hundreds of works in this
category.
. .. The Revantagiri Rāsu of Vijayasenasūri
245. The Rāsa is generally divided into Bhāsa (Skt. Bhāşā) or
Kadayaka, or sometimes as in old Gujarāti literature into Dhāla, which

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHÅMÅTYA VASTUPÄLA
may be translated as "rhythmical verse-paragraphs". The Revantagiri-Rasu
of Vijayasenasűri has four Kadavakas and 62 verses in all. The first
Kadavaka, after the benediction, refers briefly to the beautiful Soratha
country (Southern Saurāṣtra) where Girnār is situated (vv. 2-5), and
gives the genealogy of Vastupāla, mentioning the instruction imparted to
him by Vijayasena sūri and the pious deeds which it inspired (vv. 6-II),
and describes the joy of the pilgrim-caravan on seeing the vernal beauty
at the foot of Girnār (vv, 12-20). The second and the third Kadavakas
give some old history of the Girnār Tirtha and an account of the temples
built there by Vastupala, the second Kadavaka being interspersed with
some good descriptions of the wood-land. The last Kadavaka praises
goddess Ambikā and Neminātha, and dwells at some length on the religious
greatness of Girnär. The style of the work is very simple and unassuming.
Poetically the composition is interesting, and description of Girnar in
the second Kadavaka may be regarded as worthy of note-
जिम जिम चडई तडि कडणि गिरनारह, तिम तिम उडई जण भवण संसारह ।
जिम जिम सेउजलु अंगि पलोट्टए, तिम तिम कलिमलु सयलु ओहट्टए ॥

(vv. 2-4)
"As the people ascend the slopes of Girnār, they close (the doors of)
the house of worldly existence. As the limbs perspire with exertion, impur-
ities of the Kali are washed away. As the winds, cool with the waters of
streams, are blowing gently, the burning caused by the worries of worldly ex-
istence are ended instantly. Cooing of the cuckoo, cry of the peacock and
sweet humming of the bees are heard. While ascending the steps (of the
mountain), the Srāvakas see on the right side (the park) Lakhārāma. The
peak of Girnār, enclustered by a large number of clouds, charming on account
of many streams and black like the bees and the collirium, looks beautiful.
(It is Gimnār,) where the land having golden colour and full of various kinds
of minerals, looks resplendent; where the celestial herbs are shining, and
which has impenetrable, excellent, great and deep caves."
The Ābu Rāsa of Pālhaņaputra
246. The Abu Rāsa of Palhayaputra or the son of Pālhana is a poem in
50 stanzas describing the building of temples on Abu by Vastupāla and Teja-
pala. The poem is divided into Bhâsa and Thavaṇī, which occur alternately.
All the information supplied by this poem is available from other sources,
except the fact that the image of Neminātha installed in the Abul temple was
made at Stambhatirtha, which would show that the image-making and allied
arts were flourishing at the place. Though the poem has nothing noteworthy
from literary point of view, it deserves notice from the historical and linguistic
standpoint as a work describing in the popular dialect a notable event of
Vastupala's times.

ĈH A PTER XIV
WORKS ON POETICS
Development of Alamkāra-literature
247. Though Sanskrit poetry goes back to the second millenium B.C.--or
probably earlier--when the hymns of the Rgveda may have been composed, the
oldest reference to anything concerning to poetics is not found before the 6th
or 7th century B. C. The Alamkāraśāstra is not mentioned in the Vedāngas
nor do we meet with any passage in the Vedic Samhitās, Brāhmaṇas or the
earlier Upanişads in which we may find a real basis for the system of poetics.?
In the Nirukta of Yāska (circa 700 B. C.) we find a reference to the Purnā
and Luptā varieties of Upamã. The Nighantu brings particles like Iva,
Yathā, etc. under the crude term Upamá, and Yáska has cited a definition of
Upamā by Gârgya, from among his predecessors“, which would show that
some elements of Sanskrit poetics are earlier even than Yáska, who is
himself earliest extant exponent of the Veda. The great grammarian Pāṇini
(circa 500 B.C.) uses technical terms like Upamā, Upamita, Sāmānya,
Upamāna, etc. with a facility indicative of the fact that they were in general
vogue before his time, and his grammatical analysis of the general idea of
comparision is the nearest approach among early' writings to the technical
conception of poetics. The Arthaśāstra of Kautilya mentions the excellen-
ces of literary compositions, and defines them in a manner which does
not materially differ from the later writers on poetics.
248. Considerable development of the science of poetics in India can be
seen before the Nātyaśāstra of Bharata (circa 300 A. D.). The work
contains the first available exposition of the Rasa-theory, which played a
noteworthy part in the Sanskrit literary criticism and contains considerable
information upon many topics pertaining to Alamkāraśāstra. In the 16th
chapter of the Nātyaśāstra we get for the first time an outline of the science
of poetics. It enumerates four poetic figures (Alamkāras), ten excellences
(Guņas), ten defects (Doşas) and thirty-six characteristics (Laksaņas) of
poetic compositions. But the earliest authorities on poetics proper are
Dandin and Bhāmaha (circa 600 A. D.), the question of whose relative
priority of age has not been finally settled as yet. "This is followed by a
fruitful and creative stage, ending with Abhinavagupta, in which the theories
of different schools or systems were settled in their general outlines, giving
rise to four distinct schools of opinion respectively represented by the Rasa,
Alamkāra, Rīti and Dhvani-systems. It covers more than three centuries, and
includes some of the great names in the history of the discipline, like those of
Bhämaha, Udbhata and Rudrata; of Lollata, Sankuka and Bhatta Näyaka;
of Dandin and Vamana; of the Dhvanikāra, Anandavardhana and Abhina-

ragupta; of Kuntaka, Mahimabhatta and Bhoja-all of whom helped in a
constructive or destructive way to shape the different currents of thought
which ultimately ran into one stream in the text-book of Mammaţa."
249. Mammata (circa 1100 A. D.) is the most noteworthy figure
among the writers on poetics who came after the Dhvanikāra, Anandavardhana
(circa 850 4. D.) and Abhinavagupta (circa 1000 A. D.). His Kāvyaprakāśa
enjoyed a great popularity and exerted a remarkable influence in the field
of Sanskrit literature, and helped in finally establishing the authority of the
Rasa-dhvani school which was most ably expounded by the Dhyanyāloka.
The Kāvyaprakāśa tries to synthesize in a succinct and scholarly form the
tenents of different schools of Sanskrit poetics in the light of the new doct-
Tine put forward in the Dhvanyāloka. Thus having the merit of an excellent
text-book for the students, combining fulness and conciseness in its treatment,
the Kāvyaprakāśa, though composed in far off Kashmir, began to be studied
throughout the length and breadth of India within a few decades from the
time of its composition, and a large number of commentaries were written on
that scholarly work, so much so that a proverbial saying came into vogue in
Sanskrit that the Kāvyaprakāśa has been commented upon in every house
and yet it has remained a hard nut to crack. Without giving up the accepted
superiority of the Dhvani theory of poetry, Mammata attempted to effect a
compromise among the divergent schools of thought, and his views have been
generally considered the most balanced theory of poetry in Sanskrit. In the
mode of exposition and in the classification of the subject, the Kāryaprakāśa
has come to be regarded as a standard work, and many rhetoricians of repute
thought it a matter of credit to compose commentaries on it, though
they also expressed their views in independent treatises on poetics. Except
in the way of further illustrations, newer definitions and keener classifications
th; science of poetry as described by Mamuaţa has remained almost the
same since his days.3
250. The Kávyaprakāśa began to be zealously studied in Gujarát within
a few years of its composition, as is shown by the fact that the great savant
Heinacandra, who has written his Kāvyānušāsana during the first half of the
Ilh century A. D., has based his Sūtras upon, and has quoted profusely from
the Kāvyaprakāśa--at several places verbatim-and has also mentioned
Mammaţa by name.4 Itis clear that Mammata's work was used as a text-book
in Gujarăt even before the times of Hemacandra. When we bear in mind the
possible date of the composition of the Kāvyaprakāśa (circa 1100 A. D.) and
that of the Kavyānuśāsana (about 1143 A. D.), the fact seems to be more remark-
able and characteristically indicative of the culturalc ontact in ancient and media-

eval India, when there were no speedy means of communication. It would
be interesting here to note that there was considerable contact in matters (it
learning between Gujarāt and Kashmir. According to the Prabhāvakacaritii,
Somacandra (Hemacandra's name before he was installed as an Acārya) is
described as taking the permission of his Guru to propitiate the goddess living
in Käshmir (TRAITETAAN a). We know from the autobiographical account
given in the last canto of the Vikramāſkadevacarita of Bihlava that scholars
from that land of Sāradā.-as Kashmir was called-used to come to Gujarāt. In
the court of Sidhharāja Jayasimha there was a scholar named Utsāha who was
a great grammarian and whose learning was famous in Säradādesa. It was
this Utsāha who was sent by the Kashmir Panditas with eight grammars
from Kashmir, from which Hemacandra compiled his work? One of the
oldest commentaries on Mammaţa's work is by the Jaina monk Mānikya-
candra who was a friend of Vastupāla, as we have already seen (para 130),
the first commentary being by Kāshmirian Rūcaka or Ruyyaka, the famous
author of the Alamkāra-sarvasva (second and third quarters of the 12th
century). Another very old commentary on the Kāryaprakāča written in
Gujarāt is by Jayanta Bhatta ( 1294 A. D.), a contemporary of king Sāramga-
deva Vāghelã of Gujarāt (vide para 128), on whose work the commentator
Ratnakantha (between 1648-1681) had based his commentary. There are

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MABĀMĀTYA VASTUPALA
two other commentaries on the Kāyyaprakāśa written by scholars from Guja-
rāt, which are not hitherto well-known. One is by Jayānandasūri,? whose
date is not known, and the other is by the great Jaina savant Yasovijaya
( 17th contury A. D.)
The Kávyaprakās'a-saṁketa of Māņikyacandra
251. The brief review of the history of the Alamkāra-literature given
above would show that the Alamkāraśāstra was a branch of learning zealously
cultivated in Gujarat. After Hemacandra and his pupils, Rāmacandra and
Guyacandra (para 26), we can mention the names of three scholars of Vastu-
pāla's literary circle as important writers on Sanskrit poetics. Out of the
works of these three scholars, the Samketa of Māạikyacandra on the
Kāvyaprakāśa is the oldest, the other two, viz. the Alamkāramahodadhi of
Narendraprabliasūri and the Kāvyakalpalatā of Amaracandrasūri, being later
than the Samketa.
252. Māạikyacandra's Samketa is not only one of the oldest, but also
one of the most authoritative commentaries on the Kávyaprakāśa. Its
Granthägra is 3244 slokas, as mentioned at the end of an old palm-leaf manu-
script preserved at the Jaina Bhāụdār at Pāțan. This work is also important
on account of its merit as an expository work. It is entirely free from the
failings so often found in commentaries, viz. absence of explanatory comments
on difficult topics and prolixity where it is not wanted. Though Māạikya.
candra was a Jaina Sãdhu, his erudition in the Brāmanical literature and
philosophy is evident from his exposition and criticism of the text as well
as from the references and quotations given by him. Not only the author
is a scholar and a master of poetics, but he is a keen appreciator and critic of
poetry, and himself a poet of some merit. His original faculty of poetic
appreciation can be seen, as for example, in his commentary on two verses, viz.
gh famaferro (II. 9) and seriame gago (IV. 46), and also on the Kārikās
29 (TKRRIT ZI) and 30 (alias ASTO). He has given a number of quota-
tions from his own poems to make his statements clear. Thus three great
1 JRK, P. 90.
2 Looking to the great reputation of Yasovijaya as a versatile scholar his
commentary on the Kávyaprakāśa should be considered a remarkable
work. Recently Muni Sri Puạyavijayaji has found out an incomplete
manuscript of this commentary from Cambay. The work deserves to be
critically edited and printed even in the incomplete form.
3 PBO, p. 54.
4 Márikyacandra has oited 17 verses in all, which are his own compositions ;
vide pp. 188, 190, 191, 192, 193, 195, 203, 204, 205, 216, 230, 237, 252, 270.
Several of these verses (pp. 203, 204, 205, 216 ) appear to have been taken
from the hymns in praise of Jina, which shows that Māņikyajandra had
composed several devotional lyrios in addition to his Samketa and the two
Mahākävyas (vide para 182).

literary merits scholarship, critical faculty and keen poetic appreciation-are
to be found together in this commentary,
253. The remarkable scholarship and wide reading of Mūdikyacandra have
been attested by the large number of quotations and references given by him.
It also shows the author to be quite at home with the bulk of Alamkara
literature written before his time and also with Sanskrit literature in general.
He has quoted from or referred to Bhatta Nāyaka and his Hrdayadarpaņa
(pp. 4, 8), the Kāvyakautuka (p.5), Pāṇini (pp. 14, 29), Bhatta Kumārila
(p. 16) and Jaimini (p. III). Bhartsmitra (p. 17), the Vakroktikāra (p. 25),
the logician Dharmakīrti (p. 43), Māgha (p. 52), the Udbhatakumārasa-
mbhava (p: 252), the Kādambari (p. 177), the Kumārasambhaya (p. 178)
and the Sakuntalā (p. 195), the Dhyanikāra (p. 200), the Kaythābharana
(p. 216) and the Vidhhaśālabhanjikā (p. 303). Māụikyacandra has also
traced some verses quoted by Mammata to their originals. Thus he has
traced a Prākrit gāthā to the Pañcabāņalilākathā of Anandavardhana (p. 144),
and another gāthā to the Visamabāŋalīlākathā (p. 173). Some other illustrat-
ions are traced to the Pratimănirudhha Nātaka, the Veụisamhāra and the
Mālatīmādhava (p. 264), the Rāghavānanda (p. 91 ) and the Mahābhārata
(p. 86). A verse (IV. 39) has been elaborately traced in the following
manner-ATHISTHITATOT HEARFTU ATAT (p. 57 ), though nothing is defini-
tely known about this Bhatta Nārāyaṇa and the occasion on which this verse
was composed. Māạikyacandra has quoted one verse with the remarks-
TEATATACH (p. 203), and it is quite probable that it may be from the pen of
the author's Guru.
254. Moreover, Māņikyacandra has cited following authors or authori-
ties, and supported or criticized their views-Kaņāda (p. 14), the Nyāya-
kumudacandra of Prabhācandra (p. 14), Mukula (pp. 18, 22, 24), Abhinava-
gupta (pp. 25, 48), Vāmana (pp. 25, 53, 152, 186, 188, 190), Bharata
(pp. 189, 191, 192), Daņţin (pp. 189, 191, 192, 245), Bhoja (pp. 192, 195,
219, 304), Samkuka (pp. 45, 50), Bhatta Tota (p. 43), Lollata (p. 52), Bhämaha
(pp. 120, 189, 213, 287), Udbhata (pp. 121, 174, 187, 212, 259, 272, 294),
Rudrata (pp. 245, 249, 257, 266, 211, 274), Mangala (p. 190), Alamkāra.
1 The author of this lost work was Bhatta Tauta. It has been mentioned
in Abhinavagupta's commentary on Bharata (ch. I).
2 This is a lost.poem. It has been also quoted by Pratibārendurāja in his
commentary on Udbhata (PT, Vol. I, p. 187).
3 The author has not quoted from this book, but has only mentioned it by
name. Possibly it may be the Sarasvatikanthābharaṇa of Bhoja.
This lost work is also mentioned in Abhinavagupta's commentary on
Bharata (ch, XIX). There it is ascribed to Bhima.
5 Vāmana and Mangala are cited simultaneously (TetraTi ASETT a HIT
sfat area l p. 190). Hence Mangala was definitely a rhetorician.
Opinions of Mamgala have been also cited in the Kávyamimāṁsā (3rd
edition, pp. 11, 14, 16, 20) by Rājasekhara and in the Viveka on the
Kāvyānušāsana (IV. 1) by Hemacandra.

cartava (pp. 209, 219),Kohala’ and the Locana (p. 65). It is evident
from the above list lliat some of the authors and works cited in the
commentary are lost centuries ago, and lience references to theni are very
importent from historical and literary point of view.
255. Moreover, Münikyacandra has discussed at several places the
variant readings of lammata and his spoken about their relative merits
(pp. 57, 250), which shows that within about a century after the composit-
ion of the Kivyaprakāśa there had arisen some important variants in the
reddings of the text. While commenting upon a Prūkrit găthā ( 2017TEPÈ 3T
2770, IV. II2), Manikvacandra has given a short but interesting discussion
regarding the interpretation of the Prākrit word qete Or getet, and has cited
several opinions about its meaning, including that of Sātavāhana. Scholar-
ship of Māņikyacandra is also to be seen in his explanation of the following
words of the text-7 TITTER FACHAT'aJET ITT: 579'efiza (IV, 146);
he has said-TET FREATHTTT 75maSEITET: (p. 124). This is a further proof to
show that Mammata was an inhabitant of Käshnīr. The tradition that
Mammata hd written the Kivyaprakāśa upto the Parikara Alamkāra and
the rest of the work was completed by one Alaka or Alața also finds
support from Māmikyacan Ira. Commenting upon the last rerse of the
Kavyaprakisa(इत्येप मार्गों विदुषां विभिन्नो०), Manikyacandra has said-अथ चायं ग्रन्थोऽन्येना-
SECTIOTII Farfia a FaerTIST HECATTE Cerai (p. 304). This shows that
the tradition about the double authorship of the Kavyaprakāśa is very old-
known to one of the earliest commentators and therefore deserves serious
consideration. Māņikyacandra has, at some places, given old Gujarātī equi-
valents of Sanskrit words; e. g.-commenting upon a verse in the Kávya-
prakāśa (Tarraletragico, VII, 143), he says-fac Terriffa 67 ha otta:,
P. 123). The word in question is still used in Gujarāti as fēnes.
: The Alamkāramahodadhi of Narendraprabhasūri
256. Now, we come to the Alamkāramahodadhi of Narendraprabhasūri.
The Granthāgra of the work is 4500 ślokas. Following the masterpiece of
Mammața, the work has been written in the Kārikās and Vịtti. But while
the Kāvyaprakāśa has been divided into ten chapters, the Alamkāramahodadhi
comprises eight chapters, like the Kāvyānuśāsana of Hemacandra who was
the author's great predecessor in Gujarāt. The Kārikās are in the Anustup
netre, but the concluding stanza of every chapter is generally in a different
metre. The number of the Kārikās is 296 in all. The work being styled as
the Alarikāramahodadhi ("great ocean of the Alamkāras' ), its chapters are
called the Tarangas ('waves'). Presumably, the author was tempted to

chronologically older than Māņikyacandra.

employ this terminology by the example of his Guru Naracanırasuri, who
had styled the chapters of his Kathāratnākara as the Taramgas (ville para
240).
257. The author lays no claim to originality. He says that there is
nothing which has not been expounded by the ancient rhetoricians, and hence
this work is merely the selection from their sayings (p. 3). In the Prasasti
(V. 10) he says that he wrote the work after hearing the lectures of his Guru
seeking to entertain the learned and also for the benefit of his ovn acholarship.
But putting the things plainly, the Alamkāramalıodadhi has sinplific i und
extended the subject-matter of the Kārraprakā sa without interfering with its
scientific arrangement, and that can be considered the chief merit of the work.
The author has added some subsidiary matter which is not to be found in the
Kāvyaprakāśa, and that has extended the bulk of his work. He has also
taken a large number of new illustrations either from previous Alamkāra-works
or from general Sanskrit literature, and has thus made his work more readable.
The number of the illustrations cited by Waumata is 602, while the number
of those in the Alamkāramahodadhi is 982. Narendraprabha has done
justice to the contents of the ten chapters of the Kávyaprakāśa in the eight
chapters of his work. The second and third chapters of the Kāryaprakāša
h.ve been representei by the second chapter of the Alamkīraniaho ladhi,
while the subject-matter of the sixth chapter has been alınost omitted
in the latter work; and thus an economy of tivo chapters has been achiered.
The author of the Alamkāramahodadhi has been influenced by Mammata
to such a great extent that at a number of places his Kärikās as well as
Vitti are full of verbal borrowings from the Käshmīrian master (e. g.- p. 6, 7,
14-15, 43, 48, 55-56, 57, 58, 123, 180-82, 183, 184-86, 197, 199, etc. of the
Alamkārainaholadhi), but at the same time the Alamkāramahodadhi betrays
some influence of Hemacandra's Kavyānuśasana . In I. 10, while explaining
the word Sikşå with reference to a poet, the author has quoted almost
verbatim the whole portion dealing with Siksā, that is Kāvisiksă, from the
Alamkāracūņāmaņi on the Kāvyānuśāsana, Moreover, his definition of poetry
is more akin to one in the Kāvyānušāsana than to that in the Kāvyaprakāśa,
and he appears to have taken several illustrations from the two commentaries
on the Kāvyānuśāsana, viz. the Alamkāracüdāmaņi and the Viveka (e.g-no. 5
from the AC II. 170; no. 256 from the AC 1.71 and VK no. 425-281).
Narendraprabha must have also seen Māvikyacandra's Samketa on the
Kāvyaprakāśa with which we have just dealt, because while commenting
upon the Kārikā giving the purpose of poetry (p. 6) he has quoted from the
Hrdayadarpána of Bhatta Nāyaka, just like Mānikyacandra (I. 2). Máyikya-
candra in l. 3 has quoted from the Kavyakautuka (7970#10 ); the
same quotation has been given by Narendraprabha in the Vrtti on I. 7 while
dealing with the subject of Pratibhā. But inspite of all these influences the
fact remains that the Alamkāramahodadhi follows the Kavyaprakasa with
meticulous çare, though generally supplimenting, extending and simplifying
its subject matter,

of the va theory of Rasa hadhibute to the proces de ilustrations to
258. In the beginning of the Vrtti, after praising the highest light, the
author gives a genealogy of his teachers and also a genealogy of Vastupala,
his patron (vv. I-II), and he describes how the work was composed at the
request made by Vastupāla to Naracandra, author's Guru (vy. 15-21). The
first chapter is styled प्रयोजन कारण-स्वरूपभेद निर्णय' Here the author has given
the purpose and definition of poetry in general, and has also defined its three
varieties, viz. Dhvani, Guñibhūtavyamgya and Avara. Tochsgaoia' is the title
of the second chapter, and it is devoted to different powers of words-viz
Abhidhā or primary sense, Laksaņā or secondary sense and Vyañjanā or
suggested sense. In II. 16-20 the author has defined Bandha or compact-
ness of compositions as kartu FTIT TE FEET#4:, and has considered the charm
arising out of Bandha a very important thing in poetry. The third chapter is
hauty. After discussing Abhidhā and Laksaņā, the author now turns to
Vyañjanā or Dhvani. He follows the Kāvyaprakāśa in his treatment of the
production of Dhvani, but has given a number of new illustrations to show how
different circumstances contribute to the process. (pp. 49-53). The portion
about the theory of Rasa has been taken down faithfully from the fourth Ullása
of the Kāvyaprakāśa, though coming to the nine sentiments (III. 13-25), our
author's treatment becomes comparatively fuller in the matter of illustrations
and other secondary details. The author has given 39 varieties of the sugge.
sted sense (III. 63), and then he has multiplied the number to 6123 by
Samkara and saṁsrsti or permutations and combinations of those varieties (III.
64), while the Kāvyaprakāśa (IV. 44) has given the number as 10455. In
the end (III. 64-65), the author says that the Dhvani is the soul of poetry,
and it being cate does not deserve to become an eht, and hence the
Rasavat cannot be a figure of speech-as mentioned by some rhetoricians.
The whole of the third chapter of the Alamkāramahodadhi is, so to say, a
longer and simplified version of the fourth Ullāsa of the Kāvyaprakāśa.
259. The fourth chapter called quit gajalga* deals with this secondary
variety of Dhyani, while the fifth called algorauito deals with the faults of
poetry at considerable length. In this chapter the phrasing of a number of
Kārikas and the Vrtti thereon can be seen to be greatly influenced by
Mammaţa, sometimes to the extent of being almost verbatim extracts from
him. The sixth chapter is styled as mature and is devoted to the treatment
of three poetic merits, viz. Madhurya or sweetness, Ojas or strength and
Prasāda or perspicuity. The author generally follows Mammața, but his
treatment is more detailed and lucid. The seventh chapter, tomada,
deals with the figures of word. While following Mammaţa in general treat-
ment, our author has given more subdivisions, and a number of new illustrations.

The eighth chapter is stucciaria, and is deroted to the figures of serse.
The author has discussed here 70 Alamkāras in all, while the Kāryaprakāśa,
his model, has given 61, and Hemacandra discusses in z1 Sūtras 29 figures of
sense. Our author, though generally following Mammața, has arranged his
figures in a different manner, beginning with Atisarokti rather than Upamā.
He has discussed and illustrated the following nine Arthālarikāras which are
not to be found in Mammata-Ullekha, Parimana, Vikalpa, Arthipatti, l'icitra,
Rasayat, Preyah, Urjasvi and Samāhita (different from Samallii). Though
the figures Rasavat etc. are not theoretically acceptable to the author, he has
included them in his comprehensive treatment, because some other rhetoricians
have accepte i them. By defining and subdividing the figures in a simple
and methodical manner and by profusely illustrating them the author has made
his work scientific as well as interesting, and it can be said without exaggera-
tion that the Alamkāramahodadhi is one of the most notable Alamkāra-works
written by the Jaina authors after Hemacandra and the two Vāgbhatas,
260. Narendraprabha sūri appears to be a man of wide reading and
notable scholarship, from the treatment he has given to his subject, from
the accessory matter that lie has added to the theoretical nucleus found in
Mammața, and also from the authorities and illustrations that he has cited. As
authorities he has cited the following—the Hrdayadarpaņa (p. 6) and its author
Bhatta Nāyaka (p. 57), the Vākyapadiya (p. 15) and the Mahābhāşya (pp.
15-16), Mukula (p. 36), Kayyața (p. 44), Bharata and his commentator (p.
55), Lollata (p. 56), Samkuka (p. 56), Abhinavagupta (p. 58), the grammar
of Hemacandra, though it has not been expressly mentioned by name
(pp. 166, 238, 315, 332), the Dhvanikāra (pp. 182, 183), Vāmana (p. 190),
and Kuntaka (p. 201) whose name is printed in the text as Kuttu(tta )ka.
References to the following authors and works have been given-Kālidāsa
(p. 6), Bharata, Cāụakya, Vātsyāyana, the Sakuntalā and Kādambarī (p. 8),
Anandavardhana (p. II), Kanāda (p. 15), the Kumārasambhava (p. 180), the
Venisaṁhāra (p. 180), the Vīracarita (p. 181 ), the Hayagrīvavadha (p. 181 ),
'the Siśupālayadha (p. 181), the Ratnāvali (p. 181), the Arjunacarita (p. 183),
the Nāgānanda (p. 183) and the Harsacarita (pp. 250, 304).

('composed by the author himself') commentaries on it-viz. the Kavisiksā

of the poets, and were intended to supply a text-book for aspiring

more sistematic consistent and faithful manner, is more well-known
and has been published with the Kāvyakalpalatā more than once, we
shall take it first and shall treat of the Parimala later on. But before that we
should take a bird's eye view of the historical development of the literature
on Kaviáiksă. "These treatises do not deal with the conventional topics of
poetics with its theories, dogmas and definitions, but they are meant chiefly
as manuals to guide the poet in his profession, their primary object being
Kaviſiksā or instruction of the aspiring poet in the devices of the craft..
........... The ancient as well as modern writers on general poetics, no doubt,
touch occasionally upon the question of the practical training of the poet;
and it is not improbable that this, in course of time, formed the object of a
separate study and multiplied these convenient hand-books, of which neces-
sarily we possess comparatively late specimens.” According to Dr. Jacobi,
originally ars poetica in India did not go further than offering suggestions and
advice on matters of poetic craftsmanship and formulating prescriptions for
the practical guidance of the poent. This theme in later literature became a
separate study when the theoretical aspects of the problems involved began
to occupy an important place in the discipline. The cultural equipment of
the poet and his practical training were considered very important in ancient
India, and the poet had to labour long in various fields of learning before he
could please the Sahrdaya or the man of taste. Bhāmaha appears to be
cognisant of the importance of the poet's training, but his remarks on these
points are brief in comparison to Vāmana's, who deals with the subject
elaborately for the first time. While not denying the supreme necessity of
genius or poetic gift (Satkavitva, Bhāmaha I. 4) which consists in Pratibhā
(poetic genius), all writers, early or late, agree in emphasising the necessity
of study and experience. The poet is thus required to be an expert in a
long list of sciences or arts. The earliest is given by Bhāmaha (I. 9), where
grammar, prosody, lexicography, stories based on Itihāsa, ways of the world,
logic and the fine arts are mentioned as sources of poetic material. This
agrees substantially with the list given by Rudrata (I. 18). Vāmana (I. iii.
1-20) deals with the topic in greater detail, and requires the poet to be
conversant with grammar, lexicon, metrics, arts, morals, erotics, politics and,
above all, the ways and means of the world. The Kāvyamīmāṁsā of
Rājasekhara (circa 900 A. D.), a work of comparatively early date, mixes up
the topics of Kaviśikṣā with those of poetics proper, at the same time giving us
a somewhat rambling treatment of various extraneous matters, and includes
the subjects like general geography, conventions observed by the poets, a
disquisition on the seasons and an account of Kavi-gosthi etc., as of importance
for the aspiring poet.

CHAPTER XIY-WORKS ON POETICS

Ksemendra (11th century A. D. )-viz. his Aucityavicāracarcă and Kavi-
kanthābharaṇa-are notable, as they appear to have been written for the guidance
of the budding poets. But at the same time they are not full-fledged text-books
on Kaviśikṣā, but are important in as much as they treat of some practical
issues. Three notable Jaina rhetoricians, viz. Hemacandra and two lās-
bhațas wrote their works with a view to supplying suitable text-books, and
consequently while discussing general principles, they incorporated hints on
matters helpful in the practical task of poetic composition. It would be
interesting to note that both Hemacandra and the younger Tagblata have
borrowed considerably from Ksemendra and Rājasekhara? The oldest
extant full-fledged Kavišikşā-work we get also from a Jaina writer from Guja-
rāt. It is styled as Kaviśikṣā and its author is one ·Jayamangala Acārya.
A very old palm-leaf manuscript of the work has been preserved at the Jaina
Bhāņdār at Cambay. As the work includes a stanza in praise of king
Sidhharāja Jayasimha of Anahilavādi Pātan, the author appears to have been a
contemporary of that king and must haye flourished about the first half of the
twelfth century A. D. The Kāvyakalpalatā of Amaracandra comes about a
century after that. The Kavisiksă of Vinayacandra is a roluminous work on
the same subject, especially interesting because it gives much important
information about history, geography and about literary conditions in mediaeval
India. A palm-leaf manuscript of Vinayacandra's work is available in the
Jaina Bhāndār at Pāțan. The author has been conjecturably put in the first
half of the 13th century A. D.;* but anyhow he is not earlier than the begin.
ning of the 12th century A. D., because he refers to the poet Bihlana."
The Kāvyakalpalatā and its commentary Kavis'ikşā by Amaracandra
263. Thus the Kávyakalpalatã of Amaracandra is one of the oldest extant
works on the subject of Kaviśikṣā, and looking to its fame and popularity, it
can be easily considered the most authoritative and instructive book on the
practical aspect of the poet's work. The Kāvyakalpalată is in the form of
Kārikās, the number of Kārikās as printed in the edition of the Kāshi Sanskrit
Series being 798. The Kaviśiksā Vitti is a running commentary on these
Kārikās, strictly following the text, unlike the Parimala which is rather a free,
rambling exposition of the Kārikās. The Granthāgra of the Kaviśikṣā Vitti is
3357 slokas. A brief summary of the main topics dealt with in the
Kävyakalpalatã and this Vịtti will give an idea of the general scope and nature
of Kaviśiksă works.
264. The Kávyakalpalatã has been divided into four Pratánas or chapters-
viz. (I) Chandaặsidhhi, (II) Sabdasidhhi, (III) Ślesasidhhi, and (IV)
Kārikaeing 798.of Kârikås work.

Arthasidhhi. The chapters are further subdivided into Stabakas or sections,
(i) The first section of the Chandahsidhhi is Anuştup-śasana. Anuştup
being the most popular metre in Sanskrit poetry, the author has first given
practical suggestions for composition in that metre. He has suggested suita-
ble words which would fit in the Anustup, and has also given the method of
scanning the syllables and the mātrās. (ii) The second section is called
Chandobhyāsa. It enumerates the principal metres having 9 to 21 syllables
in a foot, and also the characteristics of the Aryā. For practical proficiency
in metrical compositions the author has advised the practice in narrating
stories and describing cities, daily works and worldly behaviour etc., which
would give depth and range to the studies of the poet. He has also advised
the rendering of one's own or another poet's ideas into the same or different
metres, and conversion of one metre into another. The author has given
illustrations of all these, and thus has helped the student with practical
suggestions. After the student has learnt to compose in a number of metres,
he is advised to know the Marma or secrets of the metres (Kārikā 31 ), and
by comparison and contrast to make liimself proficient in other metres also.
Thus, for example, by adding a long and a short syllable at the end of
Bhadrikā metre we get Rathodhhatā, and by adding along syllable we get Lalitā,
by adding a short syllable after the seventh syllable of the Vamśastha we get
Mañjubhāşinī, and so on (p. II). Thus after learning a few metres the
budding post can be at home with all the principal ones. At the end of the
section the author has given a dissertation on the place of caesura (Yati) in
the metre. (iii) The third section is devoted to words (Sāmanya-śabdā!)
for filling up the verse (Chandah-pūrana), which would be especially useful
for the purposes of extempore poetry. The author has given a list of words
containing one to four syllables which can be put in the beginning and the end
of Anuştup and other metres. He has illustrated both the feet of the Anuştup
in this way, and then has given siinilar treatment to other principal metres,
(iv) The fourth section is entitled Vādasiksā. The author defines Vāda as
by addimasini, and so on(De with all the printihe place
1 Titles of the chapters ending in the word Sidhhi denoting accomplish-
ment deserves notice, because all the chapters of the Sidhhiviniscaya by the
great scholar Akalazhka (circa 643 A. D.) have the word Sidhhi at the
end of their titles, and there are some works of the Vedānts philosophy
like Brahmasidhhi, Iştasidhhi, Advaitasīdhhi, etc. A work on Jyotis by
Udayaprabhasűri is called the Arambhasidhhi (vide para 116 and 301).
Thus the nomenclature of the chapters of the Kāvyakalpalatā is significant,
as it is the result of a scholarly and philosophic tradition which put
emphasis on high accomplishment in learning as well as in spiritual
attainment,
2 In ancient India Våda or learned dispute was a subject of common
importance to all the Săstras and hence there are independent treatises
on Vāda. The Budhhist scholar Vasubandhu has written a work called
Vådavidhi which is extant only in its Tibetan translation (Winter-
nitz, vol. II, p. 632; Sanmatitarka, intro., p. 79), and Sidbhasena Divākara
has composed a Vādopanişaddeātrināśikä which is seventh in his extant
Ekavimšati Drātrimśikāḥ.

follows-
वादोऽनुप्रासयुक्तोक्तिः स्वोत्कर्षः परगया । कुलशास्त्रादिनमः स्वाध्ययन्त्रया
(K. 41)
That is, by Väda is meant pointed sayings full of Inuprasa, praise of
oneself and vituperation of opponents, and interrogation of the opronent)
with regard to his fainily and learning, and declaring one's own learniny. All
these points are duly illustrated in the commentary (p. 21-2.1), anl a list of
words which can be useful in forming Anuprāsa is given (p. 20-21). From
the illustrations we get an idea as to how the learned men an I the poets
rivalled with one another in the assembly of the kings and the ininisters
in ancient and inediaeval India. The title of this section, Palasiksi,
suggests that it essentially deals with Vāclit or learned disputes of
which we get numerous accounts in old literature. (v) The fifth
section is styled Varuya-sthiti, and enumerates subjects fit for descri-
ption by the poets—like king, minister, priests, queens, prince,
commander, country, village, city, lake, ocean, rivers, carilens, forest, her-
mitage, political counsels, messenger, battle, march, hunting, horses, elephants,
rising of sun and moon, marriage, separation, collection of flowers, water-sports,
love-sport, etc. (Kārikā 45). Not satisfied by mere enumeration the author
has given hints as to how to describe these topics, because his book is much
more concerned with practice than with theory. Regarding the minister the
author has said
आन्वीक्षिकीत्रयीवार्तादण्डनीतिकृतश्रमः । क्रमागतो वणिकपुत्रो भवेद्राज्यविवृद्धये ।।
(K. 55)
It is interesting that the minister has been described as coming from
the merchant-class, because in inediaeval Gujarāt the business community
used to work in political service and the author's patron, Vastupāla, was him-
self a member of that community.
Then the author has given a list of poetic conventions (Kavisamayas)
as observed in Sanskrit literature for the guidance of his students.
265. The second chapter, Sabdasidhhi, is divided into four sections.
(i) The first chapter explains Rūdha, Yaugika and Miśra words, and cites
copious illustrations to show that only those words which are well-known
in literature can be used in poetry. (ii) The second section gives a list of
Yaugika synonyms of things and personalities, real or fictitious, generally
occurring in poetry, and advises the reader to choose from these words accor-
ding as he desires to achieve verbal conciseness or elaboration (K. 70).
(iii) The third chapter gives a long list of words which would be useful in
achieving Anuprāsa. Then the author has given a second list of words
having the syllables“ Ka to Ma at the end, for help in writing poetry full of
Anuprāsa and Yamaka. (iv) The fourth chapter explains Abhidhi, Laksanā
and Vyañjanā at length. Then the author has given a list of Lākşanika words
useful in poetry (K, 183–206), suggesting how those words can be employed
as Upamāna and Upameya. This section shows clear influence of the

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATÍA VASTUPALA
Dlivani-school which had established itself long before the times of
Amaracandra.
266. The third chapter Sleşasidhhi deals with employment of double-
meaning, because it played an important part in Sanskrit poetry. It has been
divided into four sections. (i) The first section deals with composing of
words in such a way that they can be read differently according as they are
divided and gives a list of words useful in achieving Ślesa. (ii) The second
section deals with a kind of Ślesa occurring in the description of an object by
analogies, in which the same quality or condition is to be traced in the same
words or in synonyms. (iii) The third section is devoted to the cases of
double meaning, produced by homonyms capable ef widely different inter-
pretations, and (iv) the fourth deals with the Citrakāvyas. The author has
given lists of words useful in composing the Citrakāvyas-e. g., words having
one and two syllables (pp. 86–87 and 94-96), and roots with one syllable
(pp. 92-94), and also a list of words which can be read identically both ways
(p. 100). Different varieties of the Citrakāvya have been illustrated in this
section-viz. Eta, safa, ha faz, 37( EYAT, HelTOYA, quien, and different
kinds of गूढ.
267. The fourth chapter Arthasidhhi has been divided into seven
Sections. (i) The first section is devoted to the study of Alamkāras. First
the author treats of the Upamā. He gives a list of words expressive of
Upamā and also a concordance of particular Upameyas befitting particular
Upamānas (pp. 105-107), and has set forth a number of practical suggestions
for achieving proficiency in verses with good Upamās (pp. 107-8), because
according to him-sqari Pe Fareni qamalga: (K. 36); he has shown how by
making slight changes in the Upamā, a number of other principal Alamkāras
like Rūpaka, Ananvaya, Smaraña, Sandeha, Apahnuti, Vyatireka, Utpreksā,
etc. are produced (p. 109). The Rūpaka has been given a more detailed
treatment. Hints as to how the Rūpaka should be composed and how one
and the same idea can be expressed in different ways are given (pp. III-16).
(ii-iv) The second, third and fourth sections lay down how the objects with
different colours, actions and forms should be described. (v) The fifth
section explains at length how the poet should invent poetic conceits regar-
ding support, surroundings and attributes of different objects, and thus describe
them in a charming manner. Analogy is the principal method of good expression
in poetry (K. 163) and hence the author gives a long list of analogous things-
e. g. sharp, great, auspicious, inauspicious, pure, impure, rapid, slow, strong,
weak, cruel, merciful, or things like great sounds, beautiful men, great
archers, learned kings, and so on (K. 164–248). (vi) The sixth section is
especially important to the student of Sanskrit poetry, because it gives a list
of words expressive of numbers. We get here words expressive of the figures
from one to twenty, and also of a hundred and a thousand (pp. 143-48). It
is a well-known convention among mediaeval Sanskrit authors to mention
the year of composition of their works in a roundabout way by the help of
such Samkhyā-sabdas, without giving the figures directly (cf. para 129] (vii)

The aplete from car as 450
The seventh section offers suggestions as to how to fill up different kinds of
Samasyās. The filling up of Samasyās was a very important thing for a
Sanskrit poet, especially when in public assembly or in poetic disputes, and
our author has not failed to incorporate in his text-book the practical sugge-
stions on that point.
Parimala-anothor Svopajña corimentary on the Kāvyakalpalatā
268. Another Sropajña commentary on the Kavyakalpalatā, riz. the
Parimala, cannot be described as a commentary in the technical sense; it
is a free, rambling exposition of several points of the original text. The
work is not printed. Unfortunately, both the manuscripts of the Parimala that
I could procure from the Jaina Bhāndār at Pātan end at the beginning of the
second chapter (Sabdasidhhi) at almost identical places, and hence I have
not been able to study the whole of this interesting work. A third manus-
cript of the Parimala has been noticed by Prof. H. R. Kapadia in his introduc-
tion (p. 42) to the Padmānanda Mahākāvya, but that also being incomplete
is not useful for our purpose. The Granthāgra of the Parimala has been
given by the Jaina Granthāvali as 1122 ślokas, but it seems to be wrong.
The approximate Granthāgra of the Pāta» manuscripts, both of which are
incomplete from the beginning of the second chapter, has been calculated by
Mr. Murārilāl Nāgar as 4500 ślokas, and we may assume that the entire work
being a commentary on four chapters would not be less than ten or eleven
thousand ślokas. While commenting upon the second section of the first
chapter the author has dealt with prosody at considerable length, and has
treated of the Apabhramsa metres, like Hemacandra in his Chandonuśāsana.
Here the author has laid down the characteristics of six types of Prākrits,
generally following Hemacandra. In the fifth section, Amaracandra has
enumerated different Vidyās, arts and different kinds of weapons, forms of
gods and goddesses, tenents of different schools of philosophy, and subjects
of general knowledge useful for the poet in his craft. The erotic sentiment is
the favourite subject of Sanskrit poets, and hence the author has dwelt upon
erotics, covering all its topics from the classification of different types of
men and women as laid down in the Kāmaśāstra, to love-sports. Then
the characteristics of the Nāyaka or hero and Prātināyaka or hero's rival
as well as those of the Nāyikās or heroines are given. Describing the
nature of all creatures (Sarvajīva), the commentary dwells upon the
characteristics of the creatures without feet ( serpents etc.), bipeds (men,
gods and birds), quadrupeds, and creatures with six feet (bees etc.) which
might prove of use in composing poetry. Moreover, the author has given
Purāṇic geography and something of the geography of India known in his
times. While speaking of division of time, starting from the smallest division,
he comes to the year, and then says-
दैवज्ञानां च चैत्रादिर्लोकानां श्रावणादिकः।
(folio 69)

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHAMATYA VASTUPALA
.
which shows that in the times of Amaracandra in certain parts of Gujarāt at
least, the beginning of the year was considered from the month of Srāvana.
It is interesting to note here that two works of the Jaina canon, viz. the
Bhagavati Sūtra (XVIII. 10) and the Jñātādharına Kathā (p. 107 ) refer to
the ti year, and the Arthas'āstra of Kautilya (Adhikarana II, Adhyāya 7)
also mentions it. After this, the author speaks about the glories of the
seasons-especially the spring, of the trees blossoming in it, and of their Doha-
cas or longings. Thus after mentioning a great many of details useſul to the
poet, Amarucandra completes his Parimala on the last section of the first
chapter. Then begins the commentary on the second chapter, but both the
manuscripts procured by me end even before the second section of the second
chapter is completed. The Kaviśikṣā Vịtti leaves the list of Yaugic words
(second section of the second chapter ) uncommented, which the Parimala
expounds at length, while the Parimala leaves the first section uncommented
which has been commented upon by the Kaviśikṣā Vịtti.
269. The Kávyakalpalatā and both the commentaries on it consider the
practical, rather mechanical, and not the scholarly or theoretical side of
poetry, and hence do not contain many quotations or references to authori-
ties. In the Kavisiksā Vịtti, Amaracandra mentions his own works-the
Chandoratnāvali, the Mañjarī, the Parimala and Alamkāraprabodha, and at
one place he has cited the authority of the grammarian Sākațāyana (p. 28).
In the Parimala, we find the authority of Bharata quoted (folio 64), and
also of the Chandonuśāsana (folios 2, 9) and the Grammar (folio II) of
Hemacandra. There is a reference to the Mālatímādhava (folio 61), a quotat-
ion from the Raghuvamsa (folio I), from the poet Dhanapāla (folio 9 ),' who
was a contemporary of king Bhoja of Dhārā and lived in the roth century
A. D., and also from Māņikyasūri (folio I), presumably the author of the
Samketa on the Kavyaprakāśa.
270. The above analysis of the contents of the Kāvyakalpalatā would
show how it gives practical instructions for the craft of the poet. It seems from
the manner in which Amaracandra has handled his subject-matter, that he
himself must have passed at some time through the discipline laid down in
the book. The account given by the Prabandhakośa of the testing of the
poetic faculties of Amaracandra by the court-poets of king Vīsaladeva (vide
para 103) is very interesting when considered from this point of view. In
ancient India, poetry was not merely a matter of subjective expression for the
poet. The poet had to try to please a particular audience. When a new
work was published, it was to be submitted to and approved by assemblies
of experts, as we are told by Rājasekhara and others; and the poet was

expected to fulfil all the demands of the theory. Works like the Kāvvakal-
palatā of Amaracandra teach the aspiring poet hos to fulfil those cleman.ls.
From such works we get a glimpse of the methods by which the students
were taught to compose poetry, provided they had some natural talent.
The work teaches the intricacies of metres, shows how to weave out poctic
figures, shows the tricks of producing double meaning an.) inaripuk tin,
complicated schemes of alliteration and rhyming, gives the secrets of quick
compositions and making complete strophes out of broken lines un sentences.
Though on the whole the thing is mechanical, it gives very important liiats
to the young poets and shows to what an extent the author was ? past
master in his craft and an erudite scholar of rhetoric.
271. A number of later writers have been dieeply influencel by the Kārya-
kalpalatā. The Kāvyakalpalatā of Deveśvara (circa 14th century A. 1).) (0-
sely follows in its treatment of the subject and general arrangement the work
of Amaracandra, and at several places Dereśvura luas copied down wholesale
from his predecessor. He borrows literally most of the rules an l definitions,
and repeats the illustrative stanzas. This copying is not sporadic but syste-
matic and is found throughout the work, from which we may infer that Deve-
śvara must have before him the text of Amaracandra's work. A considerable
portion of the treatment given to his subject by Amaracandra has been repro-
duced by Kesavamiśra (16th century A. D.) in his Alamkārasekhara,” though
the latter text deals, besides Kaviśikṣā, with the ordinary topics of poetics.
And to this day, the Kāvyakalpalatā of Amaracandra has cnjoyed the funne
of being a unique text-book on the subject of Kaviśikṣā among the scholars
of Sanskrit throughout India.

272. As is well-known, Vyākarana is one of the six Vedāngas or acce.
ssory sciences to the study of the Veda, which were principally concerned
with the preservation and interpretation of the sacred texts. The Padapātha
of the Rgveda prepared by Sākalya, the Prātiśāklayas and the Sikşās are
works which show what a great care was taken to preserve and pronounce
the texts in their correct form, and from the Nirukta of Yāska (circa 700 B.C.)
we know how etymological and philological discussions were carried on with
the Vedic texts as their data, and how the different schools of interpretation
had established themselves by the times of Yāska. But while discussing
the grammatical problems connected with ancient texts, the grammarians
had to take some cognisance of the current speech of the people also, and it
was probably from this tendency that the secular grammars arose.' The
first available grammar which deals with the current usage of Sanskrit as
contrasted with the archaic language of the scriptures is the monumental
Astādhyāyi of Pāụini (circa 500 B. C.), who cites by name many predecessors
including Sākatāyana (III. iv. iii), Apiſali (VI. i. 91), Sphotāyana (VI. i.
123), Sākalya (I. i. 16), Cākravarman (VI.i. 128), Senaka (V. iv. II2), Gārgya
(VIII. ïïi. 20), and Gālava (VI. iii. 61), testifying to the fact that Pāṇini had
several important works on grammar before him. From Pāṇini's references
to the easterners' some scholars have inferred the existence of the Aindra
school of grammarians which was supplanted by his grammar. In addition
to the great Mahābhāsya of Patañjali (circa 120 B. C.), there are several
accessory treatises on the Sūtras of Pāṇini, out of which may be mentioned the
Vārttika of Kātyāyana (circa 350 B, C.), the Kāśikā Vitti of Jayāditya and
Vāmana (7th century A. D.), the Dhātupātha, the Uņādisūtra traditionally
ascribed to Sākatāyana or Vararuci, and the Phiţsūtra of Santanava; these
were followed by a number of important works, which we are not mentioning
here,
273. After the times of Pāṇini, grammar occupied a very important
place in the literary and scientific studies in India, and every student had to
get at least a working knowledge of the Sabdaśāstra; and in course of time
different schools of grammar arose in different parts of India. The oldest
among these schools was probably the Kātantra, also known as the Kaumāra
or Kālāpa. This school had much influence in Kashmir and Bengal, and
was generally followed by all sections of the people in Gujarāt before
Hemacandra wrote his grammar. The Cāndra Vyākaraya of Candragomin
(circa 470 A. D.) was popular in the Budhhist countries, Kāshmir, Tibet,

Nepal, and reached Ceylon. The Sārasvata school of grammarians cannot
be put down to a date very much earlier than 1250 A. D. The influence of
this school was mostly limited to Gujarāt, Rājasthān, the region around
Delhi and Bengal, and it continued in vigour down to the modern revival of
Pāṇini under the auspices of Bhattoji Dikşita (circa 1630 A. D.) and his
pupils, when all the other schools of grammar began to decline. Among
other noteworthy schools are the Jaumāra school of Kramadīśvara (after
1150 A. D.)4 which takes its name from Jaumāranandi, the most celebrated
writer of the school, and the school of Bopadeva ( 13th century A. D.), the
author of the Mugdhabodha.
274. The Jainas have also got their own systems of grammar, and the
schools af Jainendra, Sākatāyana and Hemacandra have their own tradition
and following. The authorship of the Jainendra grammar has been tradi-
tionally ascribed to the last Jina Malāvīra, but it is the work of Pujyapáda
Devanandi, and on consideration of historical evidence scholars have put it
in the later part of the fifth century A. D. It is a condensation of Pāṇini
and the Vārttikas. Jaina Sākatāyana who belonged to the Yāpanīya samgha
is different from the ancient grammarian bearing that name, and wrote his
Sabdānusāsana in the gth century A. D. Though it was primarily meant for
the Jainas, it was also studied among other communities, if we are to judge
from references in later grammatical literature. We have already seen in the
first chapter how Hemacandra's grammar, which contains the detailed
treatment of both Sanskrit and Prākrit languages, including Apabhraméa,
was written at the request of king Sidbharāja Jayasimha. Hemacandra's
grammar nearly supplanted all other systems of grammar among the Jainas
in Gujarāt, and in the study of Prākrits its position has always remained
supreme. In addition to the commentaries and other accessory treatises
which Hemacandra wrote on his grammar, the Jaina scholars have composed,
right up to the 18th century, and in a few cases even upto this day,
a large number of works annotating, abridging, simplifying and recasting
for the convenience of students the monumental work of Hemacandra.s

CHAPTER XVI
A WORK ON METRICS
Science of metrics in Sanskrit
282. Chandas or metrics, like the Vyākarana, is also one of the six
Vedāmgas. The origin of the vedic metres may probably date back to the
Indo-Iranian period, but the science of metrics can be considered to have
begun from the time when inquiries into the nature of metrics were seriously
made. The earliest attempts are found in Indian literature in the Nidānasūtra
of the Sāmaveda, the S'āmkhāyana Srautasūtra (vii, 2), in the Ķk Prātiśākhya
and also in the Anukramaṇi of Kātyāyana. "Our authorities leave us wholly
in the dark regarding the development of metre between the Vedic and classical
periods of Sanskrit, and it is hardly very profitable speculating exactly why
there grew up in Sanskrit poetry the use of metres with a determined length of
quarter-stanzas or lines, each line being built exactly on the same model,
while the first two and the last two lines were more closely combined than
the second and the third, between which a complete caesura was essential."?
The Sūtras of Pimgala contain a section on the Vedic metres, but the
treatise as a whole is meant as a manual on classical prosody. Among
earlier writers on prosody quoted by Pimgala are Kraustuki, Tandin, Yāska,
Kāśyapa, Saitava, Rāta and Māndavya.? The name of Pimgala became so
proverbial in course of time that the word Pimgala itself came to mean "the
science of prosody", as can be seen from the title Prākṣta Pingala given to a
work on Prākrit metres composed about the 13th or 14th century A.D.
Scholars believe that Pingala is earlier than the chapters XIV and XV of the
Nātyaśāstra of Bharata which deal with metres and the relevant section of
the Agni Purāna. We get numerous treatises on metrics after the time of
these early authorities. A short manual known as the Srutabodha is ascribed
to Kālidāsa, but there are no means of identifying the author with the author
of the Sakuntalā and Raghuvamśa. In chapter CIV of his BỊhatsamhită,
Varāhamihira (circa 550 A, D.) describes various metres simultaneously
with the planetary movements, and by the 11th century A. D. we get the
Suvrttatilaka of Kșemendra, which is noteworthy because the author deals
with his subject not only from the practical, but also from the aesthetic point
of view. In the 12th century Hemacandra wrote his elaborate manual
Chandonuśāsana, which is yery important because of the bulky sections on
the Prākrit and Apabhrañía metres.
The Chandoratnāvali of Amaracandra
283. Amaracandrasūri, who was, as we have seen, one of the
foremost figures in the literary circle of Vastupāla, has also written a work

is much

ess elaborates we have opatnīva.
on metrics, called the Chandoratnārali. Amaracandra comes about a
century after Hemacandra, and being a Jaina writer from Gujarāt, his work
shows considerable influence of Hemacandra, and at times he borrows
wholesale from his great predecessor. The Chandoratnāvali is unprinted as
yet. None of its several manuscripts examined by me has noted its Grantha-
gra, but according to a rough calculation made by me it is about 820 ślokas.
Hemacandra's work is much more extensive, and its Granthyra along with
that of the Svopajña Vịtti is about 3124 ślokas.' Thus the Chandoratnāvali
being only about one-fourth in extent in comparison with the Chandonušāsana,
its treatment is naturally less elaborate, though in general plan it is
remarkably similar to Hemacandra. As we have seen before (para 106
and 269), Amaracandra has referred to the Chandoratnārali in his Kūvyn-
kalpalatā, and it is possible that he might have considered this short treatise
on metrics as a companion-volume to his work on Kaviśikṣā, as both deal
with subjects which are of much practical use in the craft of the poet.
284. The Chandoratnāvali is divided into 9 chapters. The first chapter
is called the pare, and explains the Sanjñās or terminology used in the
work, like quietot, FETTOT, ETI, FIT, Qqh97, TUHHET, E., la, etc. The second
chapter is styled the AH12717.3 It deals with various Samay;ttas, and
in the end treats of a number of Dandakas, and arrangement of Ganas
in them. The third chapter is अर्धसमवृत्ताध्याय' and the fourth is विषमवृत्ताध्याय,
and both deal with the Sama and Vişama metres respectively. The fifth
chapter is HETET14979, and lays down the characteristics of metres like Aryā,
Gīti and their various types. The sixth chapter is styled the FFATTETET,7
and deals with the exposition of prosody matematically developed in
the calculations of combinations. The seventh chapter is ga szty, and
deals with various types of Gāthā, Arya, Galita, Khañjaka, Dvipadī, Khanda-
gīti, etc., which are Mātrāvịttas principally of the Prākrit languages. The
eighth and ninth chapters are described as उत्साहादिप्रतिपादन' and पट्पदीद्विपदीच
789&to radia,10 and deal with Apabhramsa metres like Utsäha, Rāsaka, Dvipadī,
Catuspadī, Rāsāvalaya, Aļilā, Vastu, Karpūra, Kumkuma, Vadanaka, different
types of Dhavalamamgala, Fullaďaka, Jhambadaka, Ullāla, Catuşkala, Şat-
kala, Satpadī and many others. The author has also laid down the numerous
sub-varieties of some of them, has shown how the permutations and com-
binations of the metres can be made, and has given the characteristics of

LITERARY CIROLE OF MAHAMATYA VASTUPALA
Sandhi, Karlavaka and Dhruvā, which are important units in versification in
the Apabhramsa narrative poetry.
285. Amaracandra has cited a number of authorities in his work. In
chapter I and II he has quoted the opinions of Bharata, Jayadeva, Piņgala
and Srayambhū,especially while giving the alternative names of different
metres. In chapter III le has quoted the verses of Dhanapāla (10th
century A. D.) and Hemacandra Chapter VII cites a Prākrit verse in praise
of king Kumārapāla (सिरिमूलरायभूवइकुलगयणमयंक० ) and also quotes from the
Ratnāvali I. 13 (SIAISE12027710). From this chapter begins the treatment of
Prākrit and Apabhramsa metres, and here the author frankly acknowledges his
inclebtedness to the Chandonuśāsana of Hemacandra, which is alternatively
known as the Chandaścūrāmaui.3 Chapter VIII and IX which deal with
Apnblıramsa metres are also very interesting from the literary point of view,
because they quote a number of verses from the Apabhramśa literature,
Some of the verses are taken from the Chandonusāsana, as the author is
deeply indebted to that work. I shall cite only a few illustrations which
are also important from the viewpoint of literary history. At one place
in chapter IX five Dūhās of poet Muñja are compared with the five arrows
of the god of love-
चूडुल्लउ बाहोहजलु नयणा कंचुवि समघण । इय मुंजि रइया दूहडा पंच वि कामहु पंच सर ॥
"Five Dūhās composed by Muñja, containing the words 75630,
बाहोहजलु०, नयणा०, कंचुवि० and समघण० are like the five arrows of Kama.”
Two out of these five Dūhās are also given by the author-
चूडुल्लउ चुण्णीहोइसइ मुद्धि कवोलि निहित्तउ । निद्धद्धउ सासानलिण बाहसलिलसंसित्तउ ॥
"O shy one ! the bangle on your hand, when put on the cheeks,
will break to pieces being burnt by the fire of your breath and then
sprinkled over by the water of your tears."
तं तेत्तिउ बाहोहजलु लिहिणं निरु वि न पत्तु । छिमछिमिवि गंडत्थलिहिं सिमसिमिवि समत्तु ॥
1 Jayadeva bad written a treatise on metrics in the Sūtra style. He has been
quoted as a master of metrics and music by Abhinayagupta (circa 1000
A. D.) in his Abhinava bhārati (Krishnamachariar, Classical Sanskrit
Literature, p. 902) and he must have, therefore, lived before his time.
2 We know of two well-known Apabhrarśa poets-Caturmukha Svaymbhū
and his son Tribhuvana Svayambhū, who lived between the 8th and 10th
century A. D. (M. C. Modi, BHV, Vol. I, pp. 157 ff.). We do not
know whether one of them was identical with Svayambhū quoted by
Amaracandra,
3 प्राकृताधुपयोगीनि छन्दांसि कतिचिद् बुवे । एषां च लक्षणं लक्ष्यं लिखिष्यामि पृथक् पृथक् ॥
श्रीहेमसूरिप्रणीतछन्दश्चडामणेरिह । किञ्चित् किञ्चन चान्यस्माल्लक्ष्य छन्दोऽभिधान्वितम् ।।
(VII. 1-2)
4 cf. CHA, commentary on VI. 20.
5 cf. Ibid. This verse with slight variations in reading is also found in the
Prākrit grammar of Hemacandra (IV. 395).

"So much water of tears could not reach even the breasts. It simply
disappeared (evaporated) on the (very hot ) cheeks, making a sound."
We do not exactly know who this poet Muñja was. The Praban-
dhacintāmaại has nine Apabhramsa verses bearing the name of Muñja?, and
there Muñja is none but the king of Mālvā, who was a great patron of
learning and lived in the ioth century A. D. It is quite possible that the
erotic verses ascribed to Muñja and quoted by Hemacandra and Amaracandra
may be from the pen of this poet-king.

CHAPTER XVII
A WORK ON NYAYA
The Vais'eșika school and the Nyāyakandali
286. Now we take up Naracandra sūri's Tippaña on the Nyāyakandali
of Sridhara (991 A. D.), which is a commentary on the Bhāsya of Prasasta-
pāda (5th century A. D.) on the Vaišeşikasūtras of Kanāda. As is
well-known, the Vaisesika and Nyāya are two of the six traditional Darśanas.
In their earlier stages of development the two grew up as independent
systems of thought. The Nyāya or the discipline of logic really originated
in the earlier discussions in the Brāhmaṇas, which were later on systematized
in the Nyaya section of the Mimāṁsā. In fact, with appropriate variation,
Nyāya or logic was a part of every school of Indian thought-Vedic, yaina
and Budhhist. But in the early centuries of the Christian era the Nyāya,
as systematized by Gautama in his Nyāyasūtras, became a Darsana by
itself, and adopted the Vaišeşika metaphysics to complete itelf as a Darsana,
The Vašeşikasūtras are believed to be probably earlier than the Nyāya-
sūtras." The Vaiseșika was primarily a school of metaphysics, basing
itself on the atomic theory. In its early history it had its own system
of Pramāņa. But later on the Nyāya and the Vaiseșika became cognate
systems, the Vaiśesika giving prominence to the metaphysical aspect, while
the Nyāya emphasised the logical aspect.
287. It is difficult to trace the early history of the seven Padārthas or
categories of the Vaiseșika school; but we can say that the atomic theory
and the theory of Visesas or particulars is very old one, the traces of
which can be found in Pāli literature as well as in the Jaina Canon. The
Milindapañha (circa ist century A. D.) gives the words Niti (i. e. Nyāya)
and Vaisesika. In several works of the Jaina canon like the Sthānāmga
Sūtra (ch. 7), the Samavāyāmga Sūtra (p. 40), etc., and also in the Visesa-
vašyaka Bhāsya (vy, 2451-2508) we find a reference to the school of
thought called the Teräsiya or Trairāśika. The summary of the principles of
this school given by the Jaina works is "clearly Vaiseşika, of the Kanāda
type, nine substances, seventeen qualities, five forms of motion, particularity,
and inherence with, however, three forms of generality somewhat obscurely
phrased."4 The Jainas also accept a sort of atomic theory--the theory of
Pudgalas-for explaining the constitution of matter. Thus there seems to
be some relation between the Jaina theory of matter and the Vaidesika
theory of atoms. This may explain why some Jaina writers in mediaeval
times wrote commentaries on the Vaiseșika works. In fact, Naracandrasuri
was only following this tradition in writing his gloss on the Nyāyakandali

and are conside Steat influence among the waya kandalī of S'rīdharăcări
on the Bhäsya of Prasastapāda, and Rajasekharasüri (circa 1349 A. D.)
in writing his Pañjikā on the same work.
288. Old commentaries on the Bhāsya of Prasastapāda, like the
Vyomavati of Vyomas'ivācārya (7th century A. D.), the Kiraụāvali of
Udayanācārya (984 A, D.) and the Nyāya kandali of Sridharācārya have
always wielded great influence among the students of the Vais'esika school,
and are considered as land-marks in the history of the system. The
Nyāyakandalī, along with other two works, had become popular among
students and was used as a text-book in higher studies of logic. That was
especially the case in mediaeval Gujarat, because two out of a very few
available commentaries on the Nyāyakandali—the Tippaña by Naracandrasūri
and the Pañjikā by Rājasekharasūri_were composed in Gujarät, as I have
just "pointed out; great logician Vādi Devasūri( 12th century A. D.) in his
Syādvādaratnākara has often referred to and also quoted from Sridhara
mentioning him by his name and also as the Kandalikára (e. g.-pp. 328, 412,
416, 852, 923, etc.); and Jayasimhasūri, a Jaina writer from Gujarāt, has
cited with respect the opinion of the author of the Nyāyakandali in his
Nyāyatātparyadipikā (circa 1366 A. D.), which is a commentary on the
Nyāyasāra of Bhāsarvajña (ater AYETTEAR STEFFI #17:, p. 47). We are
to study here the Tippaņa of Naracandrasūri who, as I have already mention-
ed, was not only proficient in Nyāya, but was also an adept in different
Sāstras like poetics, grammar and astrology, and also in Jaina religious
studies (para 119). . .
Naracandra's Pippaņa on the Nyāyakandali
289. The Nyāyakandali expounds the contents of the monumental work
of Prasastapāda, and naturally the author who wanted to write a gloss upon
the Nyāyakandali must be not only, a profound logician, but also a
deep scholar of other systems of philosophy, as Naracandrasuri was,
Naracandra's Tippana is not printed, and is available in manuscript--form
only. Its Granthāgra is 2500 slokas, and as such it is very short in compari-
son to the Nyāyakandalī; still it shows the author's thorough grasp and his
lucid exposition of the subject-matter. Naracandra's work has merit in
another respect too. Though he was a staunch Jaina, he treated the subject
as an adherent of the Vaisesika system, following a great tradition of Indian
savants like "Vācaspati Misra (841 A. D.), who composed great expository
treatises on the texts of the Vedānta, Sãmkhya, Yoga, Mīmāmsă and Nyaya
schools--the tradition of remaining faithful to the work which they were
expounding. A few illustrative quotations would go a long way to show
this.
290. Naracandra writes as follows, commenting upon the words
and शानात्मने occurring in the benedictory verse of the Nyayakandali-अदितीयत्वं
वेदान्ताभिप्रायेण, विवटितानि आश्रितानां बन्धनानि येन स्वयं नित्यमुक्तत्वात् । अथवा महेश्वरोऽपि पुरुषेषु उत्तम

example, the Nvivalomata, on whose work he had would not spare i
इति तस्यैव नमस्कारो, अत्राद्वितीयमिति न विद्यते द्वितीयो यस्य, शानात्मने इति ज्ञानधर्मवते इत्यर्थः । आत्मशब्दो
धर्मेऽपि वर्तते यथा घटत्वं घटस्य स्वरूपं घटस्य धर्म इत्यर्थः। In this. way, though beginning the
interpretation from the view-point of the Vedānta, Naracandra has concluded
it from the stand-point of a Naiyāyika.
___In the same way, commenting upon the half-verse पराजि खानि व्यत्तृणत्
स्वयम्भूः तस्मात् परान् पश्यति नान्तरात्मा quoted by the Nyayakandali (p. 57), Nara-
candra. writes-पराञ्चि खानि इति । ब्रह्मा पराश्चि बाह्यार्थग्राहकाणीन्द्रियाणि सृष्टवांस्तत्कारणादस्मदादिशरी-
रान्तर्वर्तमान आत्मा परान् शरीराद्युपादानयोग्यान् परमाणून पश्यति । परो ह्यर्थ इन्द्रियैरेव ग्राह्यो नात्मना,
इन्द्रियाणि च न परमाणुग्रहणे समर्थानीति भावः । व्यतृणदिति तृहे रौधादिकस्य हस्तन्यां रूपम् ।'
At another place, he explains from the Nyaya-Vaisesika stand-point,
how the external desire of god can arise at the time of Pralaya-atset for
(NK, P.51)। तावत्कालावच्छेदकोपाध्यवच्छिन्नकालसहकृतत्वमेवेश्वरेच्छाया उत्पादस्तस्या नित्यत्वात् ।
एवं प्रयत्नस्यापीति । These illustrations would show Naracandra's method of
treatment of his subject, and they can be easily multiplied. It will be enough
to say that he writes here as a staunch Naiyāyika, and would not spare in
this matter even Srīdhara, on whose work he has commented. As for
example, the Nyāyakandali (p. 9) writes about the blueness of sky visible by
day-time-मध्यन्दिनेऽपि दूरगगनान्तभोगव्यापिनो नीलिम्नश्च प्रतीतेः । on which Naracandra
has criticized as follows-आलोकसद्भावेऽपि मध्यन्दिने गगनव्यापि नीलिमरूपं तमः प्रतीयते इत्यर्थः ।
एतच खसिद्धान्तनिरपेक्षयैवोक्तं, गगननीलिनो नयनगोलकगतनीलिमत्वेन स्वयमभ्युपगमात् ।।
291. It is clear from the work that Naracandra had made a thorough
study of the Nyāya-Vaišeșika literature that was written before his time, and
that he had good grasp of the theoretical differences between the Nyāya and the
Vaiseșika systems. The Nyāyakandalī refutes from the Vaiseșika point of
view the Naiyayika theory regarding the Upamana Pramāna-येऽपि श्रुतातिदेश-
वाक्यस्य, etc. (NK, p. 221), which Naracandra explains as follows-
अथ नैयायिकमतमुपदर्य दूषयन्नाह येऽपि श्रुतातिदेशेत्यादि । At another place he has
referred to the opinion of Bhusana, the commentator of the Nyaya sāra of
Bhāsarvajña", and has compared his view with that of the Nyāyakandali as
to whether the लैङ्गिक ज्ञान is उभयालंबि or एकालंबि. That is as follows-प्रत्यक्षत्वे सति
(NK, P. I17)। प्रत्यक्षत्वे स्तीति, यद्यपि पुरुषो दण्डी, पर्वतो वह्निमानित्युभयत्राप्येकालम्बनत्वमुभयालम्बनत्वं

of Vyomaśivācārya, who was an earlier commentator of Prasastapāda; and it

seems that Naracandra, before writing his Tippaņa, had thoroughly digested
the Vyomavati. This is especially remarkable, because at a number of places
he has traced the view anonymously cited by Srīdhara to the Vyomavati.

293. That Naracandra was a master of the dialectical style of the
logicians is evident from the Vikalpas of the traffata that he has given in
his Tippaņa. The passage throws ample light on Naracandra's capacity as
a logician, and as such deserves to be quoted here in its entirety-

294. The Nyayakandali has refuted at length the views of the Buddhist
philosophy setting them as the Purvapaksa. Hence the author who
writes a gloss or a commentary on the Nyāyakandali must have a thorough
grounding in the Buddhist philosophy, as Naracandrasūri had. The fact
becomes significant when we know that Budhhist logic was one of the main
subjects taught to the students in mediaeval Gujarāt (para 37). A few
illustrative quotations from the Tippaņa will be enough to show Naracandra's
proficiency in Budhhist philosophy-

The quotations show that Naracandra knew Budhhist philosophy as
propounded by different sects of the Budhhists, like Mādhyamika, Sautrānti-
ka, Vaibhāșika and Yogācāra. But for his minute knowledge of the
different philosophical tenets of these sects he could not have exactly
identified them while explaining the Pūrvapakşa in his Tippana.
295. It seems from the Tippana that Naracandra had also studied other
systems of philosophy like Samkhya-Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta. . I shall
present here a few quotations to show his knowledge of each of these
systems.

296. In addition to being a skilled logician, Naracandra was also a
teacher of grammar, as we have already seen while reviewing his Prākṣtapra-
bodha (para 281). In this Tippana also he has given etymologies of numerous
words on the authority of grammar, and has inserted at several places short
grammatical discussions, which show his command over the subject.
297. Naracandra's Tippana also supplies some important historical
information about Sridhara, the author of the Nyāyakandali. We know
from the concluding portion of the Nyāyakandali that Srīdhara was a native
of the Rādha district in the Gauda country, and that he had written his
work at the request of king Pandudasa, who was reigning there. In short,
Pāņqudāsa was the patron of Srīdhara. Now, Naracandra writes at a place
in his Tippana-पाण्डुदासोऽयमिति ग्रन्थकृच्छिष्यः । The Benares edition of the
Nyayakandali (p. 93) reads here as घटोऽयमिति। From this can be inferred
that the manuscript of the Nyāyakandali which Naracandra had got contained
some important variants and that there was a tradition prevalent, at least in
Gujarat, that Pandudāsa was a pupil of Sridhara. Naracandra's Tippana
also notes the name of Bhattacārya as the preceptor of Sridhara-गुरुभिरिन्द्रियजा

bearing on the personal history of the famous author of the Nyāyakandali
is especially noteworthy, because we do not get it from any other source.
298. Thus though Naracandra is a profound logician and a deep scholar
of various Sāstras, he is not free from a common defect found among
the Sanskrit commentators of Sāstra-works. The defect is this—that in
the beginning of the commentary, they write at length, but in the later
portions of the work their treatment becomes briefer, as if they were
fatigued by their literary effort. While expounding the Nyāyakandali, Nara
candra has written at sufficient length on the Dravyagrantha which comes
in the beginning. His treatment becomes progressively shorter as we go
further. The gloss on the Guyagrantha is shorter in comparison with that
on the Dravyagrantha ; Karma and Sāmānya are hastily passed off, nothing
is written on Višesa, and Samavāya has been treated in three or four lines
only. it is possible, however, that in the Tippaya Naracandra intended
to supply a handy guide-book to students, just like his Tippaụa on the
Anargharāghava and also his Prākſtaprabodha, and probably the Tippana
may have been in the form of lecture-notes, in which case the treatment he
has given to the subject can be assigned some reason.

CHAPTER XVIII
WORKS ON ASTROLOGY
Literature on astrology
299. Jyotiş meaning both astronomy and astrology was one of the
oldest branches of learning cultivated in India, it being one of the six
Vedāmgas. "In the Brāhmaṇas and the Sūtras we find recognition of
the idea of a lucky star, and the Dharmasūtras demand that the king shall
have an astrologer just as he has a house-chaplain, while the Arthaśāstra
ranks the court-bards, the servants of the chaplain and astrologer among
the lower court-functionaries." From the great work of Varāhamihira,
viz, his Brhatsamhita (circa 550 A. D.), we know the names of several
authorities on astrology, like Asita Devala, Garga, Vrdhha Garga, Nārada
and Parāśara, whose works are not extant-from which we know that a
number of text-books existed before the times of Varāhamihira. From
a reference in Varāhamihira* which mentions the great reputation of the
Greeks in astrology and also from the fact that a number of Sanskrit technical
terms of astrology have been directly adapted from Greek astrology, we
get a clear indication of the Hellenic influence on this branch of scientific
literature in India.
300. In later Sanskrit literature we find a number of treatises not only
on astrology, but also on omens and augury, which are allied lores. The
Jainas have made a worthy contribution to all these branches of learning,
right from the Agama-period when the works like the Jyotişkaraḥdaka,
the Gaụivijjā and the Amgavijjā were composed, upto the most recent
times, because practice of Jyotiş and medicine was the hobby and some-
times profession of the Jaina Yatis. Among the comparatively earlier
works on astrology written in Gujarat we may mention the Sāmudrikatilaka
begun in 1160 A. D. under king Kumārapāla by Durlabharāja and finished by
his son Jagaddeva, who also wrote the Svapnacintāmaņi explaining the
meaning of dreams; and also the Narapatijayacaryā Svarodaya written at
Așahilavād under king Ajayapāla by one Narahari, son of Amradeva.
The Arambhasidhhi of Udayaprabha and Jyotihsāra of Naracandra
301. A few decades after the period of Kumārapāla and Ajayapāla, we
come to the period of Vastupāla, the literary activities of whose circle include
at least two works on astrology, viz, the Arambhasidhhi of Udayaprabhasūri
and the Jyoti”sāra of Naracandrasūri. The Arambhasidhhi has 412 verses
in all, while the available portions of the Stoińsāra have 257 verses. Both

the works mainly deal with the Muhūrta-sudhhi or the finding out of correct
time for auspicious undertakings from the astrological point of view, a
branch of this science in which the Jaina writers specialized. Though
the Jaina literature can show a large number of works on astrology and allied
subjects, these two works have been always considered the most authoritative
books on the topics with which they deal, and their popularity has been
attested by the fact that scores of manuscripts of both of them can be
obtained from different old Bhāņdārs all over Gujarāt and Rājasthān.

Page 234****************************************************************************************
CHAPTER XIX
COMMENTARIES ON JAINA RELIGIOUS WORKS
Exegetical literature of the Jainas
302. Exegetical activity of the Jainas began with the Viryuktis, which
are short metrical expositions of certain parts of the scriptural texts, and
are traditionally ascribed to Bhadrabāhu ( para 224). Then there are
Bhāsyas in Prākrit verse, which are sometimes inextricably intermingled
with the Niryukti-verses. Most of the Cūrụis or Prākrit commentaries in
prose on several canoncial texts are ascribed to Jinadāsagani who lived in
the 7th century, as his Cūrại on the Nandisūtra was completed in 677 A. D.'
Then commences the period in which the Jainas began to write Sanskrit
commentaries on their religious works which were in Prākrit, because they
had fully accepted Sanskrit as the language of scholarship and high learning
by that time; and we find learned Sanskrit commentaries from the pen of
Haribhadrasūri, Sīlāmkadera, Abhayadevasūri and Malayagirimto all of
whom we have referred in the first chapter-and from several others. This
scholastic tradition continued with full vigour, upto the 17th century at least,
when important commentaries like Vinayavijaya's Subodhikā and Dharma-
sāgara's Kiraụāvali on the Kalpasūtra were composed.
303. Among the works of the literary circle of Vastupāla we do not find
any commentary on the canonical texts, but we get detailed commentaries on
three Prakaranas, which according to Jaina literary tradition mean short
treatises dealing with some aspect of Jaina religion and philosophy, mostly
composed in Prākrit verse. These three commentaries are-Udayaprabhasūri's
Karụikä on the Upadesamālā of Dharmadāsagani, and Bālacandra's two
commentaries on the Vivekamañjari and the Upadeśakandali of Ăsada.
The Upades'amālā-Karņikā of Udayaprabha
304. First we take the Upadeśamālā-Karnikā. The Upadesamālā is a
Prākrit work giving religious and moral instruction in 540 gāthās, and its author
Dharmadāsa is believed by tradition to be a pupil of Mahāvīra. But this is
hardly possible, because the language of the Upadesamālā corresponds to the
later Jaina Mahārāstrī. In any way, it is earlier than the 9th century,
because by that time Sidhharşi had written a commentary on it (para 16 ).
The Upadesamālā was very widely read and studied, and not less than
eighteen commentaries in Sanskrit, one in Prākrit and three Bālāvabod has in
old Gujarāti are known on the work. Chronologically, the Karụikā of
Udayaprabha is the fourth commentary, the earlier three being the commentary
by Sidhharsi, the Prākrit Vrtti by Jayasimhasūri (857 A. D.) a pupil of Krsụa, 4
1 JSI, p. 161;JRK, p. 201.
2 JSI, p. 31. ;
3 JRK, pp. 49-51.
4 The same author has also written a Prākrit Prakaraṇa called the Dharma-
padešamālā, in 859 A. D., evidently inspired by the work of Dharmadāsa.
Prākrit Wasa is believe the langua way, it is

LITERARY CIRCLE OF MAHĀMATYA VASTUPĀLA
and the Doghattī Vịtti by Ratnaprabhasūri ( 1182 A. D.). The Karpikā of
Udayaprabha is not printed and is available in manuscript-form only. It is
a very long commentary, its Granthāgra being 12274 ślokas. But the size of
the work has been swelled not by explanations of the text, which are usually
short, but by numerous stories and narratives inserted as illustrations of
points stressed in the gāthās; it is for this reason that the Granthāgra of the
commentary on the first three găthās only is not less than 1944 slokas.
All the illustrative stories are the typical examples of Jaina Dharmakathās.
They are taken, as a rule, from the Jaina mythology and the Jain historical
tradition, and are always in the Anuştup metre, while the textual explanations
are in prose. In his 8th Mamgala verse Udayaprabhasūri has mentioned
Sidhharşi out of his previous commentators
गाथास्तु खलु धर्मदासगणिनः सज्जातरूपश्रियः किञ्चैष स्फुरदर्थरत्ननिकरः सिद्धर्षिणैवार्पितः। '
तेनैतामतिवृत्तसंस्कृतमयीमातन्वतः कर्णिकां वृत्ति मेऽत्र सुवर्णकारपदवीसीमाश्रमश्चिन्त्यताम् ॥
(folio I) .
Bālacandra's commentaries on the Vivekamañjarī and Upades'akandali
305. Next we come to Bālacandra's commentaries on the two Prākrit
Prakaraṇas by Asada—viz. his Vivekamañjari and Upadesakandalī. The
former work contains 327 gāthās, while the latter one comprises 125 gāthās,
and both the works contain Jain religious instruction in its various aspects.
The commentary on the Vivekamañjarī is published, while that on the
Upadeśakandali being unprinted is available only in manuscript-form.
Both the commentaries have been composed in the style of the Karņikā,
inserting numerous long narratives in verse, so much so that the Granthāgra
of the commentary on the Vivekamañjarī is 8000 ślokas, while that of the
commentary on the Upadesakandali is 7600 ślokas.* The Vivekamañjari-Tīkā
has been divided into four parts, and at the end of the first three parts
the author has given a verse in praise of Jaitrasimha, Asada's son, for whom
he had composed the commentary (para 125), while at the end of the
fourth part a long Prasasti has been given, which is literally identical with
that at the end of the Upadeśakandali-ſīkā. The Upadesakandali-Tīkā
is in twelve parts, and two verses are appended at the end of each part-one
in praise of Haribhadrasūri, the Guru of Bālacandra, and the other in praise
of Asada, the author of the original Prakaraṇas. Some of the narratives in
both the Tīkās extend to several hundred verses. In the Vivekaman-
jari-ſīkā the author has given the Bharata-Bhūşana Mahākāvya,s the life
of Bharata in a versified narrative which comprises 545 verses in four
cantos; the Sītācarita Mahākāvya which has 556 verses in three cantos, and

CHAPTER XIX - COMMENTARIES ON JAINA RELIGIOUS TORKS
189
Damayanti-Lalita Mahakāvya? giving an account of Nala and Damayanti,
which contains 314 verses in three cantos. It may be remembered
that the title Mahākāvya is to be understood here in the qualified sense
of a narrative poem having great religious or mythological figures as heroes
or heroines (para 166). The Sītācarita Mahākāyya also occurs in the
Upadesakandali-Țīkā, which has another long narrative giving the life of
king Sreņika, styled the Sreņikopākhyāna Mahākāvya3 and comprising 336
verses in four cantos. As both the commentaries are from the pen of one
author, a number of stories are literally common to both of them. It is
interesting to note here that at one place in the Vivekamaījuri-ſīkā the
author has quoted a Subhāşita from his own pen.
306. Thus the method of all the three commentaries is almost identical,
and the reason of that lies in the history of the Jaina scholastic tradition
as far as it was concerned with the interpretation and study of the sacred
texts. The metrical Niryuktis and Bhāşyas many times give the story,
but only in the form of catch-words, such as would enable the reader to
recapitulate the whole story, which he would then narrate in his own words
to his students or his audience. The Prākrit Cūrnis frequently give the
illustrative stories handed down by tradition; these stories are always in
prose and are very briefly told without any literary embellishments. In
Sanskrit commentaries also the stories are generally in Prākrit, because
they are taken from older sources which were in Prākrit, though in some
Sanskrit commentaries of later date one finds these stories in their Sanskrit
versions. Not infrequently we get the stories in verse, as for example
in Nemicandra's commentary on the Uttarādhyayana Sūtra ( 1073 A. D.).
As time went on the Prākrit was cultivated less even by the Jainas, and
possibly the bilingual commentaries were found to be somewhat inconvenient
from the view-point of readers, most of whom were not scholars, even if they
were Jaina ascetics. And we come nearer to the period of the commenta-
ries we have just reviewed, which are entirely in Sanskrit and have their
stories in lucid and readable Sanskrit verse. It was customary to read
the religious Prakaranas at the time of daily sermon, and the illustrative
stories helped the preacher a lot in making his discourse interesting
to the audience. From this view-point, it can be said that the institution of
the daily Vyākhyāna or sermon was instrumental in the development of
the Jaina exegetical literature from the meniorial verses of the Niryuktis to
the elaborate and exhaustive commentaries like the writings of Udayaprabha
and Balacandra.

CONCLUSION
307. In the preceding chapters we have seen the literary and scholarly
traditions of Gujarāt in the ages that preceded that of Vastupāla, we have
studied the historical and biographical account of Vastupāla and of the poets
and scholars in his literary circle, and then we have reviewed the noteworthy
contribution which they made to Sanskrit literature, considering it form-wise.
The works of this literary circle range from stray verses to Mahākāvyas and
also deal with various branches of Sāstric literature. Even if we do not
consider the works which are known only through references and have
not yet been discovered, there are ten Mahākāvyas, four plays, eighteen
Praśastis (exclusive of the shorter inscriptions and a large number of
laudatory verses found in the Prabandhas, etc.), six Stotras, three anthologies,
a collection of Prabandhas, a collection of Jaina Dharmakathās, two
Apabhramsa Rāsas, three works on poetics including one on Kaviśikṣā,
two works on grammar (one on Sanskrit and the other on Präkrit
grammar), a work on metrics, a work on Nyāya, two works on
astrology, three commentaries on Jaina religious works and a gloss on the
Sanskrit play Anargharāghava. This contribution becomes all the more
noteworthy when we remember that it is but a part of the great literary and
scholastic activity that was going on in Gujarāt in the 13th century A. D.;
because, as remarked in the very beginning, in this book I have limited my
subject to works of those literary figures, who were directly patronized by
Vastupāla, and have not reviewed the life and works of his other contempora-
ries, among whom may be mentioned Vidyadhara (para 82), author of the
earliest known commentary on the Naişadhīyacarita, Vinayacandra, the
author of the Kaviſiksā (para 262), and Lakşmīdhara (1225 A. D.) and
Devendra ( 1242 A. D. ), who gave excellent summaries of the Tilakamañjarī
of Dhanapāla and the Upamitibhavaprapañcakathā of Sidhharsi, respectively,
and others. The extent and quality of their works were in no way negligible,
308. The most remarkable figure in the literary circle of Vastupāla was
Someśvara. This hereditary priest of the Caulukya kings of Gujarat was a
poet of distinct merit and he attempted with notable success, almost all the
forms of creative literature in Sanskrit, as we have seen in the preceding
chapters. He composed Mahākāvyas, plays, Stotras, a collection of
Muktakas, Praśastis, and numerous stray verses. In all these forms he
acquitted himself very well, and It may be said without hesitation that not
only does he occupy a high place in mediaeval Sanskrit literature, but his
works like the Kārtikaumudi may be ranked as second in merit only to the
compositions of the great masters like Kālidāsa, Bhäravi, Māgha and others
of the classical period.
309. Among other figures of the circle, whose literary works have
come down to us, may be mentioned Amaracandrasūri and Naracandrasūri.
The former was a prolific and versatile writer, as shown before, but a single
composition of his, viz, the Kāvyakalpalatā, which is a text-book of
Kapiśikṣā, has made his name famous, and the said text has proved to

CONCLUSION

be the most popular and authoritative treatise on the topic among the
students of Sanskrit, both Jainas and non-Jainas. The latter, viz. Naracandra-
sūri was proficient in various Sāstras, he had taught Vastupāla three Vidyās
(para 118), and his gloss on the Nyāyakandali of Srīdhara shows his great
erudition not only in Nyāya, but also in other Sāstras. We may also
mention Māņikyacandra, the author of the Samketa who, as we have seen,
was one of the early commentators of the Kāryaprakāśa of Mammata. I
have dealt with other literary figures at the proper places, and the same
things need not be repeated here.
310. The literary culture of Gujarāt in those days was a composite one,
in which there was an admirable cultural co-operation among the Brāhmani-
cal and Jaina scholars. We find that a royal priest like Someśvara writes
Prasastis of Jaina temples and a Jaina Sãdbu like Bālacandra borrow's
literary motifs from a great Brāhmanical work like the Bhāgayata Pūraya
(para 158). Moreover, we find that Amaracandra, also a Jain Sādhu,
summarises the whole of the Mahābhārata in verse, and praises Vyāsa in the
beginning of every canto. It may be noted that the sacred book summarized
by Amaracandra is not the Jaina version of the Mahāhārata avaliable in
the Trişastiçalākāpuruşacaritra and other works, but that great encyclopaedia
of Indian traditions and legends ascribed to Vyāsa. This emphatically
shows that listeners of Amaracandra, most of whom were most probably
Jainas, were accustomed with the Brāhmanical Mahābhārata. The age-long
enmity between the Sramana and the Brāhmaṇa mentioned by Patañjali
and others as if vanished in Gujarāt. This non-sectarian outlook in literary
matters was not accidental, but it came from commendable toleration and
the spirit of give and take which prevailed in contemporary life, represented
by the great figure of Vastupāla in almost all its aspects, as the preceding
chapters have shown. It also shows that the Hindu culture, of which
the Jaina religion and culture form an integral part, was one, and whole of
the mediaeval history of Gujarāt gives a picture in which we find this
remarkable fusion of Brāhmanical and Jaina trends which has left its inde-
lible mark on the cultural life of the whole province.
